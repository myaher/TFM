The Secret of the Alps, a small hotel tucked into the side of the Swiss mountains is too niche for most avid adventurers to have heard of, making it the perfect place for Dan to work as he sorts through his problems. Unfortunately, privacy is a coveted thing, and as Dan soon finds out, the hotel harbours one guest who values it more than most.</i></p><p>Rating: Explicit<br/>Tags: Enemies to lovers, snow, mountains, skiing, hostility, slow burn, secrecy, longing, repression, nobility, classism, cheating, eventual sex</p><h2><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F17623067%2Fchapters%2F41549267&amp;t=ZGI4Y2FkYTk0YzcxYWZiYmQxYTRlMWE1MzMwMzI2MzRkYjU2OWZmYyxicUQwS0w4Zg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AQLX6-A1TlJpHUmJGXd-m-w&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fdanfanciesphil.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F182663419145%2Ftoo-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil&amp;m=1\"><b>Ao3 Link</b></a></h2><p><b><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182478016430/new\">Chapter One</a><br/><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182479290320/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Two</a><br/><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182663419145/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Three</a><br/><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182830239889/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Four</a><br/><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182985976557/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Five</a><br/><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183146088513/too-high-cant-come-down\">Chapter Six</a><br/><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183318327771/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Seven</a></b></p><p><b>Chapter Eight</b></p><p>Dan can feel eyes boring into him as he gradually crosses the wide lobby floor to lock the front doors, then hobbles back to the desk. It takes considerable time and effort, despite the aid of Phil\u2019s ski pole.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUgh, sit down Gandalf,\u201d Phil groans, then jumps down from where he\u2019s perched on the desk. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>He snatches the ski pole from Dan\u2019s hand, then ushers him impatiently into the\u00a0 chair behind the desk; Dan thinks about indignantly asserting that he\u2019s perfectly capable, but the champagne is still pleasantly fizzing around his edges, and he can\u2019t summon enough energy to argue. Plus, it is quite painful trying to do all the many closing tasks on what he strongly suspects is a sprained ankle. He slumps in the chair, deciding to revel in the unusual sight of Phil Novokoric doing actual physical labour. He watches, trying not to seem too smug, as Phil heads into the back office to switch the lights off and lock the door, then gather the skis and poles they left haphazardly on the lobby floor, and stack them neatly against the wall.</p><!-- more --><p>Finally, Phil returns to the desk, inclines his head towards the stairs, and holds out a hand. Stunned, Dan hesitates, but slips his own into it. Phil\u2019s skin is pleasantly warm, with a softness that Dan assumes comes from never having to lift a finger. Nevertheless, he allows Phil to pull him to his feet - an action that seems as effortless as breathing to him. Like it\u2019s become natural, Phil then slings Dan\u2019s arm around his shoulders, and together they amble awkwardly to the stairs.</p><p>\u201cI can do this myself-\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust shut up and let me help you.\u201d</p><p>With considerable effort, Dan swallows his pride, and allows Phil to shuffle him, one agonising step at a time, up to the mezzanine floor. Once they emerge on the landing, Phil manoeuvres him into a chair and marches straight into the kitchen. Through the serving hatch, Dan can see him darting to and fro, spraying counters and waving a cloth about. Five minutes go by, during which time Dan chews his lip and tries to sort through the champagne-bubbled fizz of thoughts in his mind. Then, the kitchen lights flicker off and Phil pushes stylishly through the swing door. He doesn\u2019t look at Dan, just swans over to the balcony doors, locks them, then plucks a stray book from a table and places it back on its shelf. There\u2019s no more mess after that, as its just been the two of them here, so\u00a0finally, he turns to Dan, walks over, and holds out his hand again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you doing all my jobs for me \u2018cause you feel guilty about crippling me?\u201d Dan asks, voice subdued because somehow when Phil acts out the tasks Dan usually finds agonisingly dull, he makes it seem like he\u2019s performing a ballet.</p><p>\u201cYou crippled yourself,\u201d Phil replies, grabbing Dan\u2019s tentative hand and hauling him upright. Again, he lifts Dan\u2019s arm around his shoulders, and together they make their way to the stairs. \u201cI\u2019m doing your job for you so that I don\u2019t have to spend ten hours waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>The alcohol fuzz might be taking its time about receding, but this explanation still seems odd. \u201cWhy\u2019d you need to wait for me? You could just go to bed.\u201d</p><p>For a long time, Phil doesn\u2019t answer and Dan wonders if he\u2019s said something out of turn. He\u2019s about to ask something to this effect, when Phil stops mid-flight of stairs, blows a puff of exhausted air out of his cheeks and says, \u201cGod, you&rsquo;re heavier than you look.\u201d</p><p>By the time they\u2019ve reached the top floor, they\u2019re both in a bit of a state. Phil\u2019s robe has come entirely undone, revealing the dark red, clinging material of his still partly damp trunks. Dan has to actively avoid looking in that region, lest he become even more of a sweaty mess. Thankfully, Dan did remember his key, in the pocket of his robe, which he fishes out now.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Dan says, feeling sticky and unpleasantly warm from being pressed so tightly against Phil for such an extended period of time. \u201cThanks for- you know. Hobbling me.\u201d</p><p>Phil falls against the doorframe of room eight. \u201cAnytime.\u201d</p><p>A strange, thick silence stretches between them. Dan plays with his room key; he can\u2019t help but notice that Phil has made no move to retrieve his. \u201cSo\u2026 goodnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil says. In the blown pupils of his glittering eyes, Dan can see for miles, across the jagged peaks of the alps, tinged blue from the night sky. \u201cGoodnight.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t move. Shakily, Dan makes an attempt to lift his key into the lock, but he doesn\u2019t get far. Phil steps forwards, slow and cautious, closing a small gap between them. A waft of chlorine permeates the small space of the hallway. Phil reaches out, his fingers ghosting the edge of Dan\u2019s jaw, and then there is no distance between them at all. Phil is unnaturally warm and damp, his skin staticky as it brushes against him. The air seems to be having trouble working its way through the ventricles of Dan\u2019s lungs. His oxygen-starved thoughts jumble together, like they\u2019re all happening at once. All that\u2019s clear is a shocking, sea-glass blue, tinting the air itself, like he\u2019s been plunged underwater.</p><p>Phil leans towards him, and softly, fleetingly, pushes his lips against Dan\u2019s. It\u2019s so quick he could have dreamed it, but the sensation elicited - bright pulses of pure, raw energy radiating in the tips of his fingers - are enough to assure him, even as Phil pulls away, that it was very real.</p><p>A look of alarm settles itself over Phil\u2019s features. \u201cShit,\u201d he whispers, then pulls out his key from his pocket, opens the door to his room, and darts inside.</p><p>*</p><p>For the first night since he set foot in The Secret of the Alps, Dan feels no desire to cry once the door of his room closes behind him. In a daze only partly induced by the champagne, Dan wanders into the ensuite bathroom, eyes glossing over his flushed reflection in the mirror. Without thinking, he immediately begins filling the bath, as if he is being controlled by some higher, unseen force. It\u2019s nonsensical to climb into yet another tub of warm water, especially as he should be sleeping right now, but he feels an overwhelming urge to be buoyant, naked, weightless. When the bath is only halfway full, Dan slips out of the robe, pushes his trunks down his legs, and steps in. He lies back, head lolling against the ceramic edge, and closes his eyes.</p><p>Against the steady trickle of the water running from the faucet, slowly immersing him in a pool of warmth, Dan sees, in the darkness of his closed lids, Phil\u2019s face hovering above him. He is leaning in, a thousand secrets nestled in the seam slashed between his full lips. As the warmth engulfs Dan inch by inch, he relives every twitch of his nerves, every palpitation of his frantic heart. Against his mouth, he feels a kiss as soft and fleeting as the page of a book skimming his fingertip. Phil\u2019s mouth had been hot, and moist, conjuring a bolt of lightning so fierce in Dan\u2019s chest that his veins still hum with electricity.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t realise he\u2019s touching himself until his eyes flicker open, and he sees, in the clear water, his own hand moving steadily over his cock. A shudder of <i>wrong</i>ness courses through him, stirring that blinding electric pulse into a frenzy. His toes curl against the lip of the bath as his teeth sink into his lower lip. He imagines two glacial blue eyes fixed on him, and he moans, louder than he intends. He jerks faster, his other hand gripping the edge of the bath.</p><p>\u201cPhil,\u201d he groans through gritted teeth, and comes, violently, a loud splash resounding through the bathroom as he writhes through the orgasm. \u201cPhil,\u201d he breathes again as the tremors undulate through his body, and he stills.</p><p>Just then, the water begins to spill over the edge of the bath, pouring in cascades to the tiled floor.</p><p>*</p><p>Dan wakes up in a marginally less unpleasant way than normal, as the light that usually streams across his face is dull and shadowy this morning. His mouth is dry and gummy, and he has a general feeling of grogginess that he associates with his days as a University fresher. Limping into the bathroom to wash the feeling away, he steps straight through a puddle, and balks for a moment before remembering the\u2026 incident last night.</p><p>He peers down at the water between his toes, the ghost of a kiss fluttering against his lips. It takes a full four and a half minutes for his brain to click back into action, and when it does, his heart doesn\u2019t stop racing for ten more. He stares into his own eyes as he brushes his teeth, his mind a carousel of \u2018<i>how, why, how, why</i>\u2019. Perhaps all of yesterday had been some mad dream induced by the scant oxygen up here, and today is actually Saturday again.</p><p>Dan spits out a glob of toothpaste. Behind the peppermint freshness, he can still taste the hint of tart sweetness gleaned from Phil\u2019s lips. There\u2019s just no way he could have dreamed such intensity, no matter how delirious the cold and the adrenaline of his impromptu ski session had made him.</p><p>As he dresses himself, Dan glances out of the window and notices a familiar blob of crimson splintering the white horizon. He checks his phone. It\u2019s still early, yet Phil is already out on the slopes. The sight of him trekking out without so much as asking Dan along feels mildly insulting for about twenty seconds, and then he remembers how dreadful the whole experience had been yesterday, and the annoyance dissipates. Besides, his ankle is still nowhere near up to another round.\u00a0</p><p>He heads downstairs, glad of the stretch of time ahead that will be mercifully devoid of unbearably awkward, post-drunken-kiss conversations over cornflakes. Nevertheless, the emptiness pressing in from every wall of this place is decidedly unnerving. In an effort to dispel the quiet, Dan switches on the TV in the mezzanine lounge, letting it play in the background whilst he turns on lights and cookers and unlocks doors. The monotonous buzz of the newscaster\u2019s voice does help him to relax a bit, and he heads into the kitchen to make coffee and something to eat. As he spoons Crunchy Nut into his mouth, leant against the kitchen counter, Dan watches the news through the serving hatch, only half listening.</p><p>The channel he\u2019s found is in English thankfully, though the anchorman\u2019s accent is as thick as Kaspar\u2019s, so Dan can only make out about two thirds of what he\u2019s saying. The grogginess that still sits heavily around his shoulders doesn\u2019t help things; it\u2019s like he\u2019s donned an ephemeral cloak, stitched together with remnants of perplexity over the entirety of yesterday, and anxiety about what today has in store. It\u2019s only as the words \u2018oncoming\u2019 and \u2018blizzard\u2019 leave the newscaster\u2019s lips for the second time that Dan\u2019s mind focuses itself, and he lowers the spoon to listen properly.</p><p>\u201c&hellip;reports of the worst blizzard Switzerland has seen in some years. Although the majority of the storm will be shielded by the mountains, it is not advised to make any long, unnecessary journeys until it has passed. Please stay indoors if you can, and do not take any risks\u2026\u201d</p><p>Dan tunes out, heart thumping in sudden alarm. His overwrought brain fires a rapid blitz of images at him: a wall of snowfall engulfing Phil as he trudges back to the hotel, Phil being swept along by a ferocious wind and plummeting off the mountain, Phil skiing directly into a boulder, injuring himself and freezing slowly in a swirling ice storm.</p><p>Dan chucks his bowl into the sink and runs to the front desk, ankle throbbing in protest as he moves on it so carelessly. He boots up the ancient computer and waits, chanting \u201ccome on, come on, come on\u201d as it stirs slowly into life. Once its finally gotten past its Windows 98 loading screen, Dan opens the hotel database and types in Phil Novokoric, scrolling through a blur of details until he finds a mobile number. Praying it\u2019s the right one, Dan lifts the receiver of the landline, and punches it in.</p><p>It rings for at least three minutes, and Dan is convinced that Phil must have left the phone in his room, or is unable to hear it above the wind rushing past his ears. And then, mercifully, there\u2019s a click, followed by a rustling noise.\u00a0</p><p>Dan waits, breath held, and eventually hears a faint \u201cDan?\u201d</p><p>In the instant he hears his own name, Dan loses momentum. \u201cY-yes,\u201d he says, jarred. \u201cHow did you know it was- never mind, listen. You\u2019ve got to come back.\u201d</p><p>A pause. Dan pictures Phil\u2019s frown lines, etched into his pale forehead. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook up, you idiot,\u201d Dan says, Phil\u2019s slow, distant voice setting his teeth on edge. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge blizzard coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Phil says, sounding entirely unbothered. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I reckon I\u2019ve still got a few hours before-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a complete moron,\u201d Dan interrupts, louder. \u201cI\u2019m not explaining to Mona that I let you freeze to death while she was away for <i>two days</i>. If I have to hobble out to haul you back by your dumb quiff I will. Get back here.\u201d</p><p>Dan hangs up before Phil can verbalise whatever smarmy retort was surely on the tip of his tongue. His heart thumps loudly, and he lifts his thumb to his mouth, chewing on the nail. He decides to go up to the mezzanine and watch for Phil on the balcony. This idea, which seemed great in his mind, is dispelled over the next half hour as a thick, almost opaque gauze of white descends gradually over the landscape. He stays out on the balcony, peering over the railing, for as long as he can before snowy wind whipping him drives him back inside. He spends the next ten minutes googling what criteria must be met for a snowstorm to be categorised as a blizzard, and then freaking out.</p><p>Just as he\u2019s debating who to call - Mona, Kaspar, mountain rescue, his mother - the sound of the front door slamming open almost makes Dan scream in relief. He jogs down to the lobby as fast as possible on his injured foot; upon seeing Phil, his red jacket almost obscured by the layer of thick snow that covers it, Dan picks up the nearest object - the hotel brochure on the desk - and hurls it at him.</p><p>\u201cYou <i>prick</i>!\u201d</p><p>Phil removes his sunglasses, which are completely frosted over with snow. \u201cUh, ow.\u201d</p><p>The brochure had only skimmed his arm, then fallen disappointingly to the floor. Dan doesn\u2019t even entertain the thought of apologising. \u201cWhat the fuck are you playing at? You could have <i>died</i>.\u201d</p><p>Phil snorts, looking away. \u201cYou were <i>definitely </i>a drama kid.\u201d</p><p>Incensed by the typical evasion, Dan steps into Phil\u2019s space in an attempt to appear menacing. He may have more of an intimidating aura than he imagines, as Phil reacts by taking a hasty, somewhat alarmed, step backwards. Dan tries not to let this deter him.</p><p>\u201cWould it kill you to just- just- say you\u2019re sorry?\u201d His fists clench by his sides.</p><p>Phil\u2019s chin juts out. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>The next words die on Dan\u2019s tongue. He gets a distinct feeling that Phil is forcing himself not to let his eyes fall to Dan\u2019s mouth. His shoulders sag, and he steps out of Phil\u2019s bubble, wary of some charge between them that he can\u2019t articulate. He realises for the first time that Phil is shivering.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re practically frozen,\u201d Dan says, accusatorially. \u201cCome upstairs for God\u2019s sake. I\u2019ll make coffee.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>Sat at one of the small tables, opposite an uncomfortable-looking, still slightly frosty Phil, Dan tries to convey an air of general disapproval and irritation in the way he sips his coffee. He\u2019s warmed up some tomato soup he\u2019d found in a tin in the cupboard, and has put a bowl of it in front of Phil, along with a bread roll he\u2019d hastily defrosted in the microwave. It\u2019s probably still frozen in the middle - much like Phil.</p><p>To Dan\u2019s surprise, Phil picks up the spoon and swirls it in the soup. Dan waits, expectantly, but he makes no move to actually lift any to his mouth.</p><p>A frustrated sigh leaves Dan\u2019s mouth before he can stop it. \u201cI think we need to talk about yesterday.\u201d</p><p>The spoon clatters into the bowl, sending a few tiny specks of blood orange soup over the table. \u201cWhat about yesterday?\u201d</p><p>Dan avoids his eye, leaning back in the chair. \u201cLook, obviously there are some feelings of guilt here-\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Phil interrupts, hotly. \u201cSo just apologise and we\u2019ll get it over with.\u201d</p><p>Dan blanches, sure he\u2019s misheard. \u201cYou want <i>me</i> to apologise?!\u201d</p><p>Phil says nothing, but moves his attention to the macchiato Dan made him, shifting the mug from hand to hand as it\u2019s still too hot to drink.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I meant to be apologising for, exactly?\u201d Dan asks, having trouble keeping a lid on his sudden fury. \u201cHaving brittle ankles that snap in your stupid, weird skis? Getting too easily offended by your constant barrage of criticism? Or maybe somehow tripping you up in the hallway so that you stumbled and accidentally smashed your lips into mine?\u201d</p><p>At this last question, Phil slams his mug down, sloshing coffee everywhere, and leans across the table, eyes hard. \u201cI\u2019m <i>married</i>. Married! Do you understand that?\u201d</p><p>A touch concerned that perhaps his sarcastic speech had crossed a line, given the severity of Phil\u2019s reaction, Dan leans backwards, taking a pause before answering. \u201cUm\u2026 yes. It\u2019s pretty much all anyone goes on about round here, or in the news apparently-\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen kindly tell me what the fuck you\u2019re playing at,\u201d Phil interrupts, far louder than necessary. He takes a deep breath, then exhales through his nose, obviously trying to keep calm as well. \u201cLook,\u201d he says through gritted teeth. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if there\u2019s been some misunderstanding here, but I am in a committed relationship of three years. I\u2019ve vowed to spend my life with Nikolai-\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on, hold on,\u201d Dan cries, ears ringing. \u201cI\u2019m not the one misunderstanding things here. You kissed <i>me</i>!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, and you recoiled like a burned heifer,\u201d he sneers, dripping with sarcasm.</p><p>Dan splutters, flushing. He sets his coffee down, wrought iron gates slamming down protectively over his memories of last night\u2019s proceedings. \u201cI- I was surprised!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, <i>so</i> surprising that after flirting at me all day-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?! I was not <i>flirting</i>-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made me carry you back to the hotel!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause your stupid skis nearly broke my ankle!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about unloading your tragic little backstory on me in the hot tub?\u201d</p><p>Dan is seconds away from throwing more objects, and this time the nearest ones are equipped with potential scalding damage. \u201cWe were just <i>talking,</i> you absolute cock. Excuse me for thinking you were actually interested.\u201d</p><p>Phil rolls his eyes, as if the very idea of this is preposterous. \u201cDon\u2019t be obtuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God! You are such a snobbish asshole!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, forget it!\u201d Phil shouts, standing up so abruptly that the table rattles, and more coffee and soup spills everywhere, starting to drip off the edges to the carpet. \u201cLet\u2019s just wait out this fucking storm in separate rooms from now on. If I have to spend another minute with you I\u2019m gonna march back out into the blizzard and let it take me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine by me!\u201d Dan replies shrilly, though Phil is already stalking off to the stairs, abandoning his coffee and soup, both untouched.</p><p>It shouldn\u2019t bother Dan, shaking with rage as he is, that he knows Phil hasn\u2019t eaten a damn thing since yesterday morning. If he wants to starve himself for no good reason it\u2019s his own damn problem. It\u2019s not as if Dan isn\u2019t constantly making him plenty of food he could eat. He gathers the bowl and mugs and takes them into the kitchen (he\u2019d like to say he stormed in there, but his weakened ankle means he could only do an unsatisfying limp-walk), then tries to force himself to pour the remains of soup and coffee away. For three whole minutes he stares at the crockery, willing himself to just get rid of the stuff. It feels wrong, somehow, to dispose of perfectly good food and drink when there\u2019s a man upstairs who must be hungry, despite his unwillingness to eat. In the end, Dan just leaves the stuff on the side, too worked up to deal with the confusing conflict of emotions around wanting Phil to suffer, and not wanting him to literally die.</p><p>He limps out of the kitchen with a cloth and disinfectant spray, and begins cleaning the mess Phil had made during his bitch fit. Once it\u2019s done, he heads down to the lobby, deciding the only thing to do is, as Phil said, isolate himself in the furthest area of the hotel from Phil\u2019s room, and distract himself with a task that requires concentration, but little brain power. Searching vaguely through the items on display in Mona\u2019s office, Dan finds a painting with a broken frame that\u2019s come off the wall. He sits down at her desk and mends the hook on the back with some glue. Once that\u2019s done, he finds a broken air conditioning unit, which he takes apart piece by piece until he finds the fault, and can put it back together, fixed. He reattaches the snapped-off antlers of a reindeer figurine, puts batteries in Mona\u2019s radio, and winds her grandfather clock. He\u2019s just sitting down to glue the binding back on a few of the books she has lying around, when the grandfather clock chimes - it\u2019s six o\u2019clock in the evening.</p><p>Dan is sure, for a moment, that he must have knocked the hands as he was winding it, but he checks his phone, and finds that somehow time has slipped through his fingers. His joints click as he walks slowly out of Mona\u2019s office; out of the lobby windows, the world is a dark, blue-bathed sea of white. He stops in the middle of the floor, entranced by the frenzied flurry of snow whirling past the panes. He limps to the door and slides the heavy bolt, feeling a little nervous about the implications of such heavy snowfall. Is it possible to be snowed in here? Will the phones and internet still work? What if the lights go out? Dan has not been told about any fuse boxes or pilot lights.</p><p>As if his paranoid thoughts are loud bellows echoing for miles , the phone suddenly trills, and Dan hops across the lobby to get it. Just the sound of it splitting the silence is reassuring, as it means that he\u2019s not completely cut off from reality. At the last second, just as he\u2019s lifting the receiver to his ear, Dan remembers that it could be Phil, calling from his room. The mere thought is enough to have his blood boiling again, and he almost slams the phone back down, but before he can, a woman speaks.</p><p>\u201cDan?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLouise,\u201d Dan gushes immediately, eyes fluttering closed at the sound of her robust, vibrant voice. \u201cGod, it\u2019s so good to hear from you. Are you on your way back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you looked out the window, Dan?\u201d she asks, though she sounds gentle, like she might really believe he hasn\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019m stuck in Geneva until the storm passes. My plane from England only just managed to land, they\u2019ve closed all the airports now. No trains or buses are leaving the city tonight, and there\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019m climbing in a cable car to get up the mountain, despite the fact Kaspar would probably think nothing of it.\u201d</p><p>Dan listens to all of this with a growing feeling of dread. \u201cGod, poor you. How annoying. What about Mona, is she stuck in Geneva too?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause. \u201cI thought she\u2019d have called you.\u201d</p><p>Dan swallows, that growing dread doubling in size. \u201cWhat about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings aren\u2019t progressing as quickly as everyone thought with her grandmother,\u201d Louise explains, her tone uncharacteristically sombre. \u201cThe poor woman\u2019s on the brink of passing, but just keeps hanging on. Mona said the doctors said it could be a few hours, or a few days. She feels she has to stay to the end for her family\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d Dan mutters, heart squeezing in sympathy for poor Mona, stuck in some hospital room with a dying relative, no doubt feeling she has to be the hard, strong shoulder for her sobbing family to cry on. \u201cThat\u2019s terrible. So she\u2019s not gonna be back anytime soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, there\u2019s no way to know how long it will take, but I\u2019d imagine at least a day or two.\u201d</p><p>Dan sighs as silently as he can, mind once again x-raying through three floors up to Phil\u2019s room. Another day or two, at least, alone up here with him and his confusing, volatile mood swings. Based on how the past two days have been, who could say what mad, unexpected thing Phil might do or say next. For all Dan can predict about the man, he could come downstairs tomorrow morning to see Phil hula-hooping on the balcony butt-naked. It\u2019s only when Louise speaks again, splitting the silence, that Dan realises he\u2019s not responding to her, too fixated on the image he\u2019s conjured of Phil\u2019s bare, gyrating buttocks against a backdrop of beautiful snow-peaked mountains.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it been with Phil?\u201d Louise asks, as if she can read the absence of his words. \u201cHave you at least buried his body somewhere discreet?\u201d</p><p>Dan snorts. \u201cThought I\u2019d just leave him outside, let the yetis have him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously though,\u201d Louise prompts. \u201cHave you been managing?\u201d</p><p>Dan thinks for a minute about telling her the truth, that he\u2019s one snide comment away from punching him in the jaw, but decides she\u2019s got enough to worry about. \u201cI\u2019m coping. Just.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a relief,\u201d she says in a sigh. \u201cTell him I\u2019m proud of him for behaving himself.\u201d</p><p>This confuses Dan, but he agrees with a sort of grunting noise. \u201cSo I\u2019ll see you tomorrow, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as the trains are running again, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to fall hysterically into your arms and beg you for a decent meal,\u201d Dan tells her.</p><p>She snorts, and he can almost see her exasperated but pleased eye-roll. \u201cIt\u2019s been two days, Dan. Get a grip. Weren\u2019t you a uni student before this? I thought your kind lived on toast and microwave meals.\u201d</p><p>The mention of food makes Dan\u2019s stomach rumble, and he thinks uncomfortably of the now cold soup and coffee he\u2019d left in the kitchen earlier. Guilt cascades over him, consuming and sickening. He needs to force some food down Phil\u2019s throat somehow, if only to alleviate the nausea filling him head to toe.</p><p>\u201cWhich is why I so quickly became addicted to your culinary prowess,\u201d Dan says, knowing this will make her smile. \u201cAnyway, speaking of, I\u2019d better go feed the beast.\u201d</p><p>She laughs, sounding far more carefree than she had when he first picked up the phone, which makes him glad. \u201cGood luck with that. Wear gloves if you want to keep all your fingers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the tip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you soon, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye, Lou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye!\u201d</p><p>Dan hangs up with a certain reluctance, then lifts his gaze to the violent storm still raging outside the windows. He takes a deep breath, and makes his way to the stairs, not hurrying. He gets to the kitchen and walks over to investigate the soup; it\u2019s got a skin on top now, but it\u2019s basically fine. He finds a spoon, removes the thin layer from the surface, pours it into a saucepan and sets it on the hob to reheat. While it bubbles, he washes the coffee mug from before, then rummages in the freezer and fishes out one of the large pizzas Louise had made from scratch with special non-dairy cheese.</p><p>He cooks it in silence, playing on his phone and refusing to let himself think too hard about what he\u2019s doing, or the fact that the person he\u2019s doing it for is undeserving and will likely be unappreciative. He feels a lot calmer than he had a few hours ago at the table - his little handyman spree had helped his roiling anger to settle back into the low buzz of irritation he always feels when he thinks about Phil. The devil on Dan\u2019s shoulder helpfully conjures an image of being in the bath last night, very much <i>not</i> irritated with Phil whatsoever. Quite the opposite, in fact.</p><p>He burns himself retrieving the cooked pizza, cheeks aflame.</p><p>Dan slices the pizza, puts half the slices on a plate, and pours some of the tomato soup into a bowl. He then finds a packet of Pringles, a big bar of dark chocolate, an apple, and a can of Diet Coke. He puts all of these things on a tray with some cutlery and a napkin, then begins an agonising and slow journey up to Phil\u2019s room, carrying the heavy thing.</p><p>By the time he reaches the top floor, his arms are aching, he\u2019s breathless, and his ankle throbs angrily. He pounds on the door of room eight with his injured foot, not caring anymore that he\u2019ll likely be sorry later when it\u2019s even more swollen. It takes a few minutes for Phil to answer, which is probably a deliberate snub that just makes Dan even more pissed off. The moment Phil is visible, Dan shoves the tray at him, practically snarling.</p><p>\u201cYou have to eat,\u201d Dan snaps before he has a chance to say anything. \u201cI couldn\u2019t give less of a fuck about you choosing a life of martyrdom or whatever, but if my boss returns to find I\u2019ve let you wither away over the two days I\u2019m responsible for keeping you alive, I\u2019ll be fired and have to return to a shitty life, a shitty course, and a shitty family. So eat this, for God\u2019s sake. It\u2019s not cute, or attractive, or impressive to starve yourself.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s mouth has fallen open a short way, but he doesn\u2019t make any move to try and give the tray back. His wide blue eyes are locked on Dan, but Dan is already staggering back down the hall as best he can. He\u2019s sure he looks an absolute prat, barely able to make it without a stabilising hand on the wall, but he doesn\u2019t care.</p><p>He waits, not stopping, for the inevitable retort echoing after him, but it never comes.</p><p><b>(<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183634739921/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Nine</a>!)</b></p>",

Unfortunately, privacy is a coveted thing, and as Dan soon finds out, the hotel harbours one guest who values it more than most.</i></p><p>Rating: Explicit<br>Tags: Enemies to lovers, snow, mountains, skiing, hostility, slow burn, secrecy, longing, repression, nobility, classism, cheating, eventual sex</p><h2><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F17623067%2Fchapters%2F41549267&amp;t=ZGI4Y2FkYTk0YzcxYWZiYmQxYTRlMWE1MzMwMzI2MzRkYjU2OWZmYyxicUQwS0w4Zg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AQLX6-A1TlJpHUmJGXd-m-w&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fdanfanciesphil.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F182663419145%2Ftoo-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil&amp;m=1\"><b>Ao3 Link</b></a></h2><p><b><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182478016430/new\">Chapter One</a><br><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182479290320/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Two</a><br><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182663419145/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Three</a><br><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182830239889/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Four</a><br><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182985976557/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Five</a><br><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183146088513/too-high-cant-come-down\">Chapter Six</a><br><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183318327771/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Seven</a></b></p><p><b>Chapter Eight</b></p><p>Dan can feel eyes boring into him as he gradually crosses the wide lobby floor to lock the front doors, then hobbles back to the desk. It takes considerable time and effort, despite the aid of Phil\u2019s ski pole.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUgh, sit down Gandalf,\u201d Phil groans, then jumps down from where he\u2019s perched on the desk. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>He snatches the ski pole from Dan\u2019s hand, then ushers him impatiently into the\u00a0 chair behind the desk; Dan thinks about indignantly asserting that he\u2019s perfectly capable, but the champagne is still pleasantly fizzing around his edges, and he can\u2019t summon enough energy to argue. Plus, it is quite painful trying to do all the many closing tasks on what he strongly suspects is a sprained ankle. He slumps in the chair, deciding to revel in the unusual sight of Phil Novokoric doing actual physical labour. He watches, trying not to seem too smug, as Phil heads into the back office to switch the lights off and lock the door, then gather the skis and poles they left haphazardly on the lobby floor, and stack them neatly against the wall.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Finally, Phil returns to the desk, inclines his head towards the stairs, and holds out a hand. Stunned, Dan hesitates, but slips his own into it. Phil\u2019s skin is pleasantly warm, with a softness that Dan assumes comes from never having to lift a finger. Nevertheless, he allows Phil to pull him to his feet - an action that seems as effortless as breathing to him. Like it\u2019s become natural, Phil then slings Dan\u2019s arm around his shoulders, and together they amble awkwardly to the stairs.</p><p>\u201cI can do this myself-\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust shut up and let me help you.\u201d</p><p>With considerable effort, Dan swallows his pride, and allows Phil to shuffle him, one agonising step at a time, up to the mezzanine floor. Once they emerge on the landing, Phil manoeuvres him into a chair and marches straight into the kitchen. Through the serving hatch, Dan can see him darting to and fro, spraying counters and waving a cloth about. Five minutes go by, during which time Dan chews his lip and tries to sort through the champagne-bubbled fizz of thoughts in his mind. Then, the kitchen lights flicker off and Phil pushes stylishly through the swing door. He doesn\u2019t look at Dan, just swans over to the balcony doors, locks them, then plucks a stray book from a table and places it back on its shelf. There\u2019s no more mess after that, as its just been the two of them here, so\u00a0finally, he turns to Dan, walks over, and holds out his hand again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you doing all my jobs for me \u2018cause you feel guilty about crippling me?\u201d Dan asks, voice subdued because somehow when Phil acts out the tasks Dan usually finds agonisingly dull, he makes it seem like he\u2019s performing a ballet.</p><p>\u201cYou crippled yourself,\u201d Phil replies, grabbing Dan\u2019s tentative hand and hauling him upright. Again, he lifts Dan\u2019s arm around his shoulders, and together they make their way to the stairs. \u201cI\u2019m doing your job for you so that I don\u2019t have to spend ten hours waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>The alcohol fuzz might be taking its time about receding, but this explanation still seems odd. \u201cWhy\u2019d you need to wait for me? You could just go to bed.\u201d</p><p>For a long time, Phil doesn\u2019t answer and Dan wonders if he\u2019s said something out of turn. He\u2019s about to ask something to this effect, when Phil stops mid-flight of stairs, blows a puff of exhausted air out of his cheeks and says, \u201cGod, you\u2019re heavier than you look.\u201d</p><p>By the time they\u2019ve reached the top floor, they\u2019re both in a bit of a state. Phil\u2019s robe has come entirely undone, revealing the dark red, clinging material of his still partly damp trunks. Dan has to actively avoid looking in that region, lest he become even more of a sweaty mess. Thankfully, Dan did remember his key, in the pocket of his robe, which he fishes out now.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Dan says, feeling sticky and unpleasantly warm from being pressed so tightly against Phil for such an extended period of time. \u201cThanks for- you know. Hobbling me.\u201d</p><p>Phil falls against the doorframe of room eight. \u201cAnytime.\u201d</p><p>A strange, thick silence stretches between them. Dan plays with his room key; he can\u2019t help but notice that Phil has made no move to retrieve his. \u201cSo\u2026 goodnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil says. In the blown pupils of his glittering eyes, Dan can see for miles, across the jagged peaks of the alps, tinged blue from the night sky. \u201cGoodnight.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t move. Shakily, Dan makes an attempt to lift his key into the lock, but he doesn\u2019t get far. Phil steps forwards, slow and cautious, closing a small gap between them. A waft of chlorine permeates the small space of the hallway. Phil reaches out, his fingers ghosting the edge of Dan\u2019s jaw, and then there is no distance between them at all. Phil is unnaturally warm and damp, his skin staticky as it brushes against him. The air seems to be having trouble working its way through the ventricles of Dan\u2019s lungs. His oxygen-starved thoughts jumble together, like they\u2019re all happening at once. All that\u2019s clear is a shocking, sea-glass blue, tinting the air itself, like he\u2019s been plunged underwater.</p><p>Phil leans towards him, and softly, fleetingly, pushes his lips against Dan\u2019s. It\u2019s so quick he could have dreamed it, but the sensation elicited - bright pulses of pure, raw energy radiating in the tips of his fingers - are enough to assure him, even as Phil pulls away, that it was very real.</p><p>A look of alarm settles itself over Phil\u2019s features. \u201cShit,\u201d he whispers, then pulls out his key from his pocket, opens the door to his room, and darts inside.</p><p>*</p><p>For the first night since he set foot in The Secret of the Alps, Dan feels no desire to cry once the door of his room closes behind him. In a daze only partly induced by the champagne, Dan wanders into the ensuite bathroom, eyes glossing over his flushed reflection in the mirror. Without thinking, he immediately begins filling the bath, as if he is being controlled by some higher, unseen force. It\u2019s nonsensical to climb into yet another tub of warm water, especially as he should be sleeping right now, but he feels an overwhelming urge to be buoyant, naked, weightless. When the bath is only halfway full, Dan slips out of the robe, pushes his trunks down his legs, and steps in. He lies back, head lolling against the ceramic edge, and closes his eyes.</p><p>Against the steady trickle of the water running from the faucet, slowly immersing him in a pool of warmth, Dan sees, in the darkness of his closed lids, Phil\u2019s face hovering above him. He is leaning in, a thousand secrets nestled in the seam slashed between his full lips. As the warmth engulfs Dan inch by inch, he relives every twitch of his nerves, every palpitation of his frantic heart. Against his mouth, he feels a kiss as soft and fleeting as the page of a book skimming his fingertip. Phil\u2019s mouth had been hot, and moist, conjuring a bolt of lightning so fierce in Dan\u2019s chest that his veins still hum with electricity.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t realise he\u2019s touching himself until his eyes flicker open, and he sees, in the clear water, his own hand moving steadily over his cock. A shudder of <i>wrong</i>ness courses through him, stirring that blinding electric pulse into a frenzy. His toes curl against the lip of the bath as his teeth sink into his lower lip. He imagines two glacial blue eyes fixed on him, and he moans, louder than he intends. He jerks faster, his other hand gripping the edge of the bath.</p><p>\u201cPhil,\u201d he groans through gritted teeth, and comes, violently, a loud splash resounding through the bathroom as he writhes through the orgasm. \u201cPhil,\u201d he breathes again as the tremors undulate through his body, and he stills.</p><p>Just then, the water begins to spill over the edge of the bath, pouring in cascades to the tiled floor.</p><p>*</p><p>Dan wakes up in a marginally less unpleasant way than normal, as the light that usually streams across his face is dull and shadowy this morning. His mouth is dry and gummy, and he has a general feeling of grogginess that he associates with his days as a University fresher. Limping into the bathroom to wash the feeling away, he steps straight through a puddle, and balks for a moment before remembering the\u2026 incident last night.</p><p>He peers down at the water between his toes, the ghost of a kiss fluttering against his lips. It takes a full four and a half minutes for his brain to click back into action, and when it does, his heart doesn\u2019t stop racing for ten more. He stares into his own eyes as he brushes his teeth, his mind a carousel of \u2018<i>how, why, how, why</i>\u2019. Perhaps all of yesterday had been some mad dream induced by the scant oxygen up here, and today is actually Saturday again.</p><p>Dan spits out a glob of toothpaste. Behind the peppermint freshness, he can still taste the hint of tart sweetness gleaned from Phil\u2019s lips. There\u2019s just no way he could have dreamed such intensity, no matter how delirious the cold and the adrenaline of his impromptu ski session had made him.</p><p>As he dresses himself, Dan glances out of the window and notices a familiar blob of crimson splintering the white horizon. He checks his phone. It\u2019s still early, yet Phil is already out on the slopes. The sight of him trekking out without so much as asking Dan along feels mildly insulting for about twenty seconds, and then he remembers how dreadful the whole experience had been yesterday, and the annoyance dissipates. Besides, his ankle is still nowhere near up to another round.\u00a0</p><p>He heads downstairs, glad of the stretch of time ahead that will be mercifully devoid of unbearably awkward, post-drunken-kiss conversations over cornflakes. Nevertheless, the emptiness pressing in from every wall of this place is decidedly unnerving. In an effort to dispel the quiet, Dan switches on the TV in the mezzanine lounge, letting it play in the background whilst he turns on lights and cookers and unlocks doors. The monotonous buzz of the newscaster\u2019s voice does help him to relax a bit, and he heads into the kitchen to make coffee and something to eat. As he spoons Crunchy Nut into his mouth, leant against the kitchen counter, Dan watches the news through the serving hatch, only half listening.</p><p>The channel he\u2019s found is in English thankfully, though the anchorman\u2019s accent is as thick as Kaspar\u2019s, so Dan can only make out about two thirds of what he\u2019s saying. The grogginess that still sits heavily around his shoulders doesn\u2019t help things; it\u2019s like he\u2019s donned an ephemeral cloak, stitched together with remnants of perplexity over the entirety of yesterday, and anxiety about what today has in store. It\u2019s only as the words \u2018oncoming\u2019 and \u2018blizzard\u2019 leave the newscaster\u2019s lips for the second time that Dan\u2019s mind focuses itself, and he lowers the spoon to listen properly.</p><p>\u201c\u2026reports of the worst blizzard Switzerland has seen in some years. Although the majority of the storm will be shielded by the mountains, it is not advised to make any long, unnecessary journeys until it has passed. Please stay indoors if you can, and do not take any risks\u2026\u201d</p><p>Dan tunes out, heart thumping in sudden alarm. His overwrought brain fires a rapid blitz of images at him: a wall of snowfall engulfing Phil as he trudges back to the hotel, Phil being swept along by a ferocious wind and plummeting off the mountain, Phil skiing directly into a boulder, injuring himself and freezing slowly in a swirling ice storm.</p><p>Dan chucks his bowl into the sink and runs to the front desk, ankle throbbing in protest as he moves on it so carelessly. He boots up the ancient computer and waits, chanting \u201ccome on, come on, come on\u201d as it stirs slowly into life. Once its finally gotten past its Windows 98 loading screen, Dan opens the hotel database and types in Phil Novokoric, scrolling through a blur of details until he finds a mobile number. Praying it\u2019s the right one, Dan lifts the receiver of the landline, and punches it in.</p><p>It rings for at least three minutes, and Dan is convinced that Phil must have left the phone in his room, or is unable to hear it above the wind rushing past his ears. And then, mercifully, there\u2019s a click, followed by a rustling noise.\u00a0</p><p>Dan waits, breath held, and eventually hears a faint \u201cDan?\u201d</p><p>In the instant he hears his own name, Dan loses momentum. \u201cY-yes,\u201d he says, jarred. \u201cHow did you know it was- never mind, listen. You\u2019ve got to come back.\u201d</p><p>A pause. Dan pictures Phil\u2019s frown lines, etched into his pale forehead. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook up, you idiot,\u201d Dan says, Phil\u2019s slow, distant voice setting his teeth on edge. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge blizzard coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Phil says, sounding entirely unbothered. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I reckon I\u2019ve still got a few hours before-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a complete moron,\u201d Dan interrupts, louder. \u201cI\u2019m not explaining to Mona that I let you freeze to death while she was away for <i>two days</i>. If I have to hobble out to haul you back by your dumb quiff I will. Get back here.\u201d</p><p>Dan hangs up before Phil can verbalise whatever smarmy retort was surely on the tip of his tongue. His heart thumps loudly, and he lifts his thumb to his mouth, chewing on the nail. He decides to go up to the mezzanine and watch for Phil on the balcony. This idea, which seemed great in his mind, is dispelled over the next half hour as a thick, almost opaque gauze of white descends gradually over the landscape. He stays out on the balcony, peering over the railing, for as long as he can before snowy wind whipping him drives him back inside. He spends the next ten minutes googling what criteria must be met for a snowstorm to be categorised as a blizzard, and then freaking out.</p><p>Just as he\u2019s debating who to call - Mona, Kaspar, mountain rescue, his mother - the sound of the front door slamming open almost makes Dan scream in relief. He jogs down to the lobby as fast as possible on his injured foot; upon seeing Phil, his red jacket almost obscured by the layer of thick snow that covers it, Dan picks up the nearest object - the hotel brochure on the desk - and hurls it at him.</p><p>\u201cYou <i>prick</i>!\u201d</p><p>Phil removes his sunglasses, which are completely frosted over with snow. \u201cUh, ow.\u201d</p><p>The brochure had only skimmed his arm, then fallen disappointingly to the floor. Dan doesn\u2019t even entertain the thought of apologising. \u201cWhat the fuck are you playing at? You could have <i>died</i>.\u201d</p><p>Phil snorts, looking away. \u201cYou were <i>definitely </i>a drama kid.\u201d</p><p>Incensed by the typical evasion, Dan steps into Phil\u2019s space in an attempt to appear menacing. He may have more of an intimidating aura than he imagines, as Phil reacts by taking a hasty, somewhat alarmed, step backwards. Dan tries not to let this deter him.</p><p>\u201cWould it kill you to just- just- say you\u2019re sorry?\u201d His fists clench by his sides.</p><p>Phil\u2019s chin juts out. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>The next words die on Dan\u2019s tongue. He gets a distinct feeling that Phil is forcing himself not to let his eyes fall to Dan\u2019s mouth. His shoulders sag, and he steps out of Phil\u2019s bubble, wary of some charge between them that he can\u2019t articulate. He realises for the first time that Phil is shivering.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re practically frozen,\u201d Dan says, accusatorially. \u201cCome upstairs for God\u2019s sake. I\u2019ll make coffee.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>Sat at one of the small tables, opposite an uncomfortable-looking, still slightly frosty Phil, Dan tries to convey an air of general disapproval and irritation in the way he sips his coffee. He\u2019s warmed up some tomato soup he\u2019d found in a tin in the cupboard, and has put a bowl of it in front of Phil, along with a bread roll he\u2019d hastily defrosted in the microwave. It\u2019s probably still frozen in the middle - much like Phil.</p><p>To Dan\u2019s surprise, Phil picks up the spoon and swirls it in the soup. Dan waits, expectantly, but he makes no move to actually lift any to his mouth.</p><p>A frustrated sigh leaves Dan\u2019s mouth before he can stop it. \u201cI think we need to talk about yesterday.\u201d</p><p>The spoon clatters into the bowl, sending a few tiny specks of blood orange soup over the table. \u201cWhat about yesterday?\u201d</p><p>Dan avoids his eye, leaning back in the chair. \u201cLook, obviously there are some feelings of guilt here-\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Phil interrupts, hotly. \u201cSo just apologise and we\u2019ll get it over with.\u201d</p><p>Dan blanches, sure he\u2019s misheard. \u201cYou want <i>me</i> to apologise?!\u201d</p><p>Phil says nothing, but moves his attention to the macchiato Dan made him, shifting the mug from hand to hand as it\u2019s still too hot to drink.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I meant to be apologising for, exactly?\u201d Dan asks, having trouble keeping a lid on his sudden fury. \u201cHaving brittle ankles that snap in your stupid, weird skis? Getting too easily offended by your constant barrage of criticism? Or maybe somehow tripping you up in the hallway so that you stumbled and accidentally smashed your lips into mine?\u201d</p><p>At this last question, Phil slams his mug down, sloshing coffee everywhere, and leans across the table, eyes hard. \u201cI\u2019m <i>married</i>. Married! Do you understand that?\u201d</p><p>A touch concerned that perhaps his sarcastic speech had crossed a line, given the severity of Phil\u2019s reaction, Dan leans backwards, taking a pause before answering. \u201cUm\u2026 yes. It\u2019s pretty much all anyone goes on about round here, or in the news apparently-\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen kindly tell me what the fuck you\u2019re playing at,\u201d Phil interrupts, far louder than necessary. He takes a deep breath, then exhales through his nose, obviously trying to keep calm as well. \u201cLook,\u201d he says through gritted teeth. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if there\u2019s been some misunderstanding here, but I am in a committed relationship of three years. I\u2019ve vowed to spend my life with Nikolai-\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on, hold on,\u201d Dan cries, ears ringing. \u201cI\u2019m not the one misunderstanding things here. You kissed <i>me</i>!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, and you recoiled like a burned heifer,\u201d he sneers, dripping with sarcasm.</p><p>Dan splutters, flushing. He sets his coffee down, wrought iron gates slamming down protectively over his memories of last night\u2019s proceedings. \u201cI- I was surprised!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, <i>so</i> surprising that after flirting at me all day-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?! I was not <i>flirting</i>-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made me carry you back to the hotel!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause your stupid skis nearly broke my ankle!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about unloading your tragic little backstory on me in the hot tub?\u201d</p><p>Dan is seconds away from throwing more objects, and this time the nearest ones are equipped with potential scalding damage. \u201cWe were just <i>talking,</i> you absolute cock. Excuse me for thinking you were actually interested.\u201d</p><p>Phil rolls his eyes, as if the very idea of this is preposterous. \u201cDon\u2019t be obtuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God! You are such a snobbish asshole!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, forget it!\u201d Phil shouts, standing up so abruptly that the table rattles, and more coffee and soup spills everywhere, starting to drip off the edges to the carpet. \u201cLet\u2019s just wait out this fucking storm in separate rooms from now on. If I have to spend another minute with you I\u2019m gonna march back out into the blizzard and let it take me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine by me!\u201d Dan replies shrilly, though Phil is already stalking off to the stairs, abandoning his coffee and soup, both untouched.</p><p>It shouldn\u2019t bother Dan, shaking with rage as he is, that he knows Phil hasn\u2019t eaten a damn thing since yesterday morning. If he wants to starve himself for no good reason it\u2019s his own damn problem. It\u2019s not as if Dan isn\u2019t constantly making him plenty of food he could eat. He gathers the bowl and mugs and takes them into the kitchen (he\u2019d like to say he stormed in there, but his weakened ankle means he could only do an unsatisfying limp-walk), then tries to force himself to pour the remains of soup and coffee away. For three whole minutes he stares at the crockery, willing himself to just get rid of the stuff. It feels wrong, somehow, to dispose of perfectly good food and drink when there\u2019s a man upstairs who must be hungry, despite his unwillingness to eat. In the end, Dan just leaves the stuff on the side, too worked up to deal with the confusing conflict of emotions around wanting Phil to suffer, and not wanting him to literally die.</p><p>He limps out of the kitchen with a cloth and disinfectant spray, and begins cleaning the mess Phil had made during his bitch fit. Once it\u2019s done, he heads down to the lobby, deciding the only thing to do is, as Phil said, isolate himself in the furthest area of the hotel from Phil\u2019s room, and distract himself with a task that requires concentration, but little brain power. Searching vaguely through the items on display in Mona\u2019s office, Dan finds a painting with a broken frame that\u2019s come off the wall. He sits down at her desk and mends the hook on the back with some glue. Once that\u2019s done, he finds a broken air conditioning unit, which he takes apart piece by piece until he finds the fault, and can put it back together, fixed. He reattaches the snapped-off antlers of a reindeer figurine, puts batteries in Mona\u2019s radio, and winds her grandfather clock. He\u2019s just sitting down to glue the binding back on a few of the books she has lying around, when the grandfather clock chimes - it\u2019s six o\u2019clock in the evening.</p><p>Dan is sure, for a moment, that he must have knocked the hands as he was winding it, but he checks his phone, and finds that somehow time has slipped through his fingers. His joints click as he walks slowly out of Mona\u2019s office; out of the lobby windows, the world is a dark, blue-bathed sea of white. He stops in the middle of the floor, entranced by the frenzied flurry of snow whirling past the panes. He limps to the door and slides the heavy bolt, feeling a little nervous about the implications of such heavy snowfall. Is it possible to be snowed in here? Will the phones and internet still work? What if the lights go out? Dan has not been told about any fuse boxes or pilot lights.</p><p>As if his paranoid thoughts are loud bellows echoing for miles , the phone suddenly trills, and Dan hops across the lobby to get it. Just the sound of it splitting the silence is reassuring, as it means that he\u2019s not completely cut off from reality. At the last second, just as he\u2019s lifting the receiver to his ear, Dan remembers that it could be Phil, calling from his room. The mere thought is enough to have his blood boiling again, and he almost slams the phone back down, but before he can, a woman speaks.</p><p>\u201cDan?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLouise,\u201d Dan gushes immediately, eyes fluttering closed at the sound of her robust, vibrant voice. \u201cGod, it\u2019s so good to hear from you. Are you on your way back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you looked out the window, Dan?\u201d she asks, though she sounds gentle, like she might really believe he hasn\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019m stuck in Geneva until the storm passes. My plane from England only just managed to land, they\u2019ve closed all the airports now. No trains or buses are leaving the city tonight, and there\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019m climbing in a cable car to get up the mountain, despite the fact Kaspar would probably think nothing of it.\u201d</p><p>Dan listens to all of this with a growing feeling of dread. \u201cGod, poor you. How annoying. What about Mona, is she stuck in Geneva too?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause. \u201cI thought she\u2019d have called you.\u201d</p><p>Dan swallows, that growing dread doubling in size. \u201cWhat about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings aren\u2019t progressing as quickly as everyone thought with her grandmother,\u201d Louise explains, her tone uncharacteristically sombre. \u201cThe poor woman\u2019s on the brink of passing, but just keeps hanging on. Mona said the doctors said it could be a few hours, or a few days. She feels she has to stay to the end for her family\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d Dan mutters, heart squeezing in sympathy for poor Mona, stuck in some hospital room with a dying relative, no doubt feeling she has to be the hard, strong shoulder for her sobbing family to cry on. \u201cThat\u2019s terrible. So she\u2019s not gonna be back anytime soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, there\u2019s no way to know how long it will take, but I\u2019d imagine at least a day or two.\u201d</p><p>Dan sighs as silently as he can, mind once again x-raying through three floors up to Phil\u2019s room. Another day or two, at least, alone up here with him and his confusing, volatile mood swings. Based on how the past two days have been, who could say what mad, unexpected thing Phil might do or say next. For all Dan can predict about the man, he could come downstairs tomorrow morning to see Phil hula-hooping on the balcony butt-naked. It\u2019s only when Louise speaks again, splitting the silence, that Dan realises he\u2019s not responding to her, too fixated on the image he\u2019s conjured of Phil\u2019s bare, gyrating buttocks against a backdrop of beautiful snow-peaked mountains.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it been with Phil?\u201d Louise asks, as if she can read the absence of his words. \u201cHave you at least buried his body somewhere discreet?\u201d</p><p>Dan snorts. \u201cThought I\u2019d just leave him outside, let the yetis have him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously though,\u201d Louise prompts. \u201cHave you been managing?\u201d</p><p>Dan thinks for a minute about telling her the truth, that he\u2019s one snide comment away from punching him in the jaw, but decides she\u2019s got enough to worry about. \u201cI\u2019m coping. Just.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a relief,\u201d she says in a sigh. \u201cTell him I\u2019m proud of him for behaving himself.\u201d</p><p>This confuses Dan, but he agrees with a sort of grunting noise. \u201cSo I\u2019ll see you tomorrow, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as the trains are running again, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to fall hysterically into your arms and beg you for a decent meal,\u201d Dan tells her.</p><p>She snorts, and he can almost see her exasperated but pleased eye-roll. \u201cIt\u2019s been two days, Dan. Get a grip. Weren\u2019t you a uni student before this? I thought your kind lived on toast and microwave meals.\u201d</p><p>The mention of food makes Dan\u2019s stomach rumble, and he thinks uncomfortably of the now cold soup and coffee he\u2019d left in the kitchen earlier. Guilt cascades over him, consuming and sickening. He needs to force some food down Phil\u2019s throat somehow, if only to alleviate the nausea filling him head to toe.</p><p>\u201cWhich is why I so quickly became addicted to your culinary prowess,\u201d Dan says, knowing this will make her smile. \u201cAnyway, speaking of, I\u2019d better go feed the beast.\u201d</p><p>She laughs, sounding far more carefree than she had when he first picked up the phone, which makes him glad. \u201cGood luck with that. Wear gloves if you want to keep all your fingers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the tip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you soon, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye, Lou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye!\u201d</p><p>Dan hangs up with a certain reluctance, then lifts his gaze to the violent storm still raging outside the windows. He takes a deep breath, and makes his way to the stairs, not hurrying. He gets to the kitchen and walks over to investigate the soup; it\u2019s got a skin on top now, but it\u2019s basically fine. He finds a spoon, removes the thin layer from the surface, pours it into a saucepan and sets it on the hob to reheat. While it bubbles, he washes the coffee mug from before, then rummages in the freezer and fishes out one of the large pizzas Louise had made from scratch with special non-dairy cheese.</p><p>He cooks it in silence, playing on his phone and refusing to let himself think too hard about what he\u2019s doing, or the fact that the person he\u2019s doing it for is undeserving and will likely be unappreciative. He feels a lot calmer than he had a few hours ago at the table - his little handyman spree had helped his roiling anger to settle back into the low buzz of irritation he always feels when he thinks about Phil. The devil on Dan\u2019s shoulder helpfully conjures an image of being in the bath last night, very much <i>not</i> irritated with Phil whatsoever. Quite the opposite, in fact.</p><p>He burns himself retrieving the cooked pizza, cheeks aflame.</p><p>Dan slices the pizza, puts half the slices on a plate, and pours some of the tomato soup into a bowl. He then finds a packet of Pringles, a big bar of dark chocolate, an apple, and a can of Diet Coke. He puts all of these things on a tray with some cutlery and a napkin, then begins an agonising and slow journey up to Phil\u2019s room, carrying the heavy thing.</p><p>By the time he reaches the top floor, his arms are aching, he\u2019s breathless, and his ankle throbs angrily. He pounds on the door of room eight with his injured foot, not caring anymore that he\u2019ll likely be sorry later when it\u2019s even more swollen. It takes a few minutes for Phil to answer, which is probably a deliberate snub that just makes Dan even more pissed off. The moment Phil is visible, Dan shoves the tray at him, practically snarling.</p><p>\u201cYou have to eat,\u201d Dan snaps before he has a chance to say anything. \u201cI couldn\u2019t give less of a fuck about you choosing a life of martyrdom or whatever, but if my boss returns to find I\u2019ve let you wither away over the two days I\u2019m responsible for keeping you alive, I\u2019ll be fired and have to return to a shitty life, a shitty course, and a shitty family. So eat this, for God\u2019s sake. It\u2019s not cute, or attractive, or impressive to starve yourself.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s mouth has fallen open a short way, but he doesn\u2019t make any move to try and give the tray back. His wide blue eyes are locked on Dan, but Dan is already staggering back down the hall as best he can. He\u2019s sure he looks an absolute prat, barely able to make it without a stabilising hand on the wall, but he doesn\u2019t care.</p><p>He waits, not stopping, for the inevitable retort echoing after him, but it never comes.</p><p><b>(<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183634739921/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Nine</a>!)</b></p>",

The Secret of the Alps, a small hotel tucked into the side of the Swiss mountains is too niche for most avid adventurers to have heard of, making it the perfect place for Dan to work as he sorts through his problems. Unfortunately, privacy is a coveted thing, and as Dan soon finds out, the hotel harbours one guest who values it more than most.</i></p><p>Rating: Explicit<br>Tags: Enemies to lovers, snow, mountains, skiing, hostility, slow burn, secrecy, longing, repression, nobility, classism, cheating, eventual sex</p><h2><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F17623067%2Fchapters%2F41549267&amp;t=ZGI4Y2FkYTk0YzcxYWZiYmQxYTRlMWE1MzMwMzI2MzRkYjU2OWZmYyxicUQwS0w4Zg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AQLX6-A1TlJpHUmJGXd-m-w&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fdanfanciesphil.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F182663419145%2Ftoo-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil&amp;m=1\"><b>Ao3 Link</b></a></h2><p><b><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182478016430/new\">Chapter One</a><br><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182479290320/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Two</a><br><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182663419145/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Three</a><br><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182830239889/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Four</a><br><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182985976557/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Five</a><br><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183146088513/too-high-cant-come-down\">Chapter Six</a><br><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183318327771/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Seven</a></b></p><p><b>Chapter Eight</b></p><p>Dan can feel eyes boring into him as he gradually crosses the wide lobby floor to lock the front doors, then hobbles back to the desk. It takes considerable time and effort, despite the aid of Phil\u2019s ski pole.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUgh, sit down Gandalf,\u201d Phil groans, then jumps down from where he\u2019s perched on the desk. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>He snatches the ski pole from Dan\u2019s hand, then ushers him impatiently into the\u00a0 chair behind the desk; Dan thinks about indignantly asserting that he\u2019s perfectly capable, but the champagne is still pleasantly fizzing around his edges, and he can\u2019t summon enough energy to argue. Plus, it is quite painful trying to do all the many closing tasks on what he strongly suspects is a sprained ankle. He slumps in the chair, deciding to revel in the unusual sight of Phil Novokoric doing actual physical labour. He watches, trying not to seem too smug, as Phil heads into the back office to switch the lights off and lock the door, then gather the skis and poles they left haphazardly on the lobby floor, and stack them neatly against the wall.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Finally, Phil returns to the desk, inclines his head towards the stairs, and holds out a hand. Stunned, Dan hesitates, but slips his own into it. Phil\u2019s skin is pleasantly warm, with a softness that Dan assumes comes from never having to lift a finger. Nevertheless, he allows Phil to pull him to his feet - an action that seems as effortless as breathing to him. Like it\u2019s become natural, Phil then slings Dan\u2019s arm around his shoulders, and together they amble awkwardly to the stairs.</p><p>\u201cI can do this myself-\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust shut up and let me help you.\u201d</p><p>With considerable effort, Dan swallows his pride, and allows Phil to shuffle him, one agonising step at a time, up to the mezzanine floor. Once they emerge on the landing, Phil manoeuvres him into a chair and marches straight into the kitchen. Through the serving hatch, Dan can see him darting to and fro, spraying counters and waving a cloth about. Five minutes go by, during which time Dan chews his lip and tries to sort through the champagne-bubbled fizz of thoughts in his mind. Then, the kitchen lights flicker off and Phil pushes stylishly through the swing door. He doesn\u2019t look at Dan, just swans over to the balcony doors, locks them, then plucks a stray book from a table and places it back on its shelf. There\u2019s no more mess after that, as its just been the two of them here, so\u00a0finally, he turns to Dan, walks over, and holds out his hand again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you doing all my jobs for me \u2018cause you feel guilty about crippling me?\u201d Dan asks, voice subdued because somehow when Phil acts out the tasks Dan usually finds agonisingly dull, he makes it seem like he\u2019s performing a ballet.</p><p>\u201cYou crippled yourself,\u201d Phil replies, grabbing Dan\u2019s tentative hand and hauling him upright. Again, he lifts Dan\u2019s arm around his shoulders, and together they make their way to the stairs. \u201cI\u2019m doing your job for you so that I don\u2019t have to spend ten hours waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>The alcohol fuzz might be taking its time about receding, but this explanation still seems odd. \u201cWhy\u2019d you need to wait for me? You could just go to bed.\u201d</p><p>For a long time, Phil doesn\u2019t answer and Dan wonders if he\u2019s said something out of turn. He\u2019s about to ask something to this effect, when Phil stops mid-flight of stairs, blows a puff of exhausted air out of his cheeks and says, \u201cGod, you\u2019re heavier than you look.\u201d</p><p>By the time they\u2019ve reached the top floor, they\u2019re both in a bit of a state. Phil\u2019s robe has come entirely undone, revealing the dark red, clinging material of his still partly damp trunks. Dan has to actively avoid looking in that region, lest he become even more of a sweaty mess. Thankfully, Dan did remember his key, in the pocket of his robe, which he fishes out now.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Dan says, feeling sticky and unpleasantly warm from being pressed so tightly against Phil for such an extended period of time. \u201cThanks for- you know. Hobbling me.\u201d</p><p>Phil falls against the doorframe of room eight. \u201cAnytime.\u201d</p><p>A strange, thick silence stretches between them. Dan plays with his room key; he can\u2019t help but notice that Phil has made no move to retrieve his. \u201cSo\u2026 goodnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil says. In the blown pupils of his glittering eyes, Dan can see for miles, across the jagged peaks of the alps, tinged blue from the night sky. \u201cGoodnight.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t move. Shakily, Dan makes an attempt to lift his key into the lock, but he doesn\u2019t get far. Phil steps forwards, slow and cautious, closing a small gap between them. A waft of chlorine permeates the small space of the hallway. Phil reaches out, his fingers ghosting the edge of Dan\u2019s jaw, and then there is no distance between them at all. Phil is unnaturally warm and damp, his skin staticky as it brushes against him. The air seems to be having trouble working its way through the ventricles of Dan\u2019s lungs. His oxygen-starved thoughts jumble together, like they\u2019re all happening at once. All that\u2019s clear is a shocking, sea-glass blue, tinting the air itself, like he\u2019s been plunged underwater.</p><p>Phil leans towards him, and softly, fleetingly, pushes his lips against Dan\u2019s. It\u2019s so quick he could have dreamed it, but the sensation elicited - bright pulses of pure, raw energy radiating in the tips of his fingers - are enough to assure him, even as Phil pulls away, that it was very real.</p><p>A look of alarm settles itself over Phil\u2019s features. \u201cShit,\u201d he whispers, then pulls out his key from his pocket, opens the door to his room, and darts inside.</p><p>*</p><p>For the first night since he set foot in The Secret of the Alps, Dan feels no desire to cry once the door of his room closes behind him. In a daze only partly induced by the champagne, Dan wanders into the ensuite bathroom, eyes glossing over his flushed reflection in the mirror. Without thinking, he immediately begins filling the bath, as if he is being controlled by some higher, unseen force. It\u2019s nonsensical to climb into yet another tub of warm water, especially as he should be sleeping right now, but he feels an overwhelming urge to be buoyant, naked, weightless. When the bath is only halfway full, Dan slips out of the robe, pushes his trunks down his legs, and steps in. He lies back, head lolling against the ceramic edge, and closes his eyes.</p><p>Against the steady trickle of the water running from the faucet, slowly immersing him in a pool of warmth, Dan sees, in the darkness of his closed lids, Phil\u2019s face hovering above him. He is leaning in, a thousand secrets nestled in the seam slashed between his full lips. As the warmth engulfs Dan inch by inch, he relives every twitch of his nerves, every palpitation of his frantic heart. Against his mouth, he feels a kiss as soft and fleeting as the page of a book skimming his fingertip. Phil\u2019s mouth had been hot, and moist, conjuring a bolt of lightning so fierce in Dan\u2019s chest that his veins still hum with electricity.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t realise he\u2019s touching himself until his eyes flicker open, and he sees, in the clear water, his own hand moving steadily over his cock. A shudder of <i>wrong</i>ness courses through him, stirring that blinding electric pulse into a frenzy. His toes curl against the lip of the bath as his teeth sink into his lower lip. He imagines two glacial blue eyes fixed on him, and he moans, louder than he intends. He jerks faster, his other hand gripping the edge of the bath.</p><p>\u201cPhil,\u201d he groans through gritted teeth, and comes, violently, a loud splash resounding through the bathroom as he writhes through the orgasm. \u201cPhil,\u201d he breathes again as the tremors undulate through his body, and he stills.</p><p>Just then, the water begins to spill over the edge of the bath, pouring in cascades to the tiled floor.</p><p>*</p><p>Dan wakes up in a marginally less unpleasant way than normal, as the light that usually streams across his face is dull and shadowy this morning. His mouth is dry and gummy, and he has a general feeling of grogginess that he associates with his days as a University fresher. Limping into the bathroom to wash the feeling away, he steps straight through a puddle, and balks for a moment before remembering the\u2026 incident last night.</p><p>He peers down at the water between his toes, the ghost of a kiss fluttering against his lips. It takes a full four and a half minutes for his brain to click back into action, and when it does, his heart doesn\u2019t stop racing for ten more. He stares into his own eyes as he brushes his teeth, his mind a carousel of \u2018<i>how, why, how, why</i>\u2019. Perhaps all of yesterday had been some mad dream induced by the scant oxygen up here, and today is actually Saturday again.</p><p>Dan spits out a glob of toothpaste. Behind the peppermint freshness, he can still taste the hint of tart sweetness gleaned from Phil\u2019s lips. There\u2019s just no way he could have dreamed such intensity, no matter how delirious the cold and the adrenaline of his impromptu ski session had made him.</p><p>As he dresses himself, Dan glances out of the window and notices a familiar blob of crimson splintering the white horizon. He checks his phone. It\u2019s still early, yet Phil is already out on the slopes. The sight of him trekking out without so much as asking Dan along feels mildly insulting for about twenty seconds, and then he remembers how dreadful the whole experience had been yesterday, and the annoyance dissipates. Besides, his ankle is still nowhere near up to another round.\u00a0</p><p>He heads downstairs, glad of the stretch of time ahead that will be mercifully devoid of unbearably awkward, post-drunken-kiss conversations over cornflakes. Nevertheless, the emptiness pressing in from every wall of this place is decidedly unnerving. In an effort to dispel the quiet, Dan switches on the TV in the mezzanine lounge, letting it play in the background whilst he turns on lights and cookers and unlocks doors. The monotonous buzz of the newscaster\u2019s voice does help him to relax a bit, and he heads into the kitchen to make coffee and something to eat. As he spoons Crunchy Nut into his mouth, leant against the kitchen counter, Dan watches the news through the serving hatch, only half listening.</p><p>The channel he\u2019s found is in English thankfully, though the anchorman\u2019s accent is as thick as Kaspar\u2019s, so Dan can only make out about two thirds of what he\u2019s saying. The grogginess that still sits heavily around his shoulders doesn\u2019t help things; it\u2019s like he\u2019s donned an ephemeral cloak, stitched together with remnants of perplexity over the entirety of yesterday, and anxiety about what today has in store. It\u2019s only as the words \u2018oncoming\u2019 and \u2018blizzard\u2019 leave the newscaster\u2019s lips for the second time that Dan\u2019s mind focuses itself, and he lowers the spoon to listen properly.</p><p>\u201c\u2026reports of the worst blizzard Switzerland has seen in some years. Although the majority of the storm will be shielded by the mountains, it is not advised to make any long, unnecessary journeys until it has passed. Please stay indoors if you can, and do not take any risks\u2026\u201d</p><p>Dan tunes out, heart thumping in sudden alarm. His overwrought brain fires a rapid blitz of images at him: a wall of snowfall engulfing Phil as he trudges back to the hotel, Phil being swept along by a ferocious wind and plummeting off the mountain, Phil skiing directly into a boulder, injuring himself and freezing slowly in a swirling ice storm.</p><p>Dan chucks his bowl into the sink and runs to the front desk, ankle throbbing in protest as he moves on it so carelessly. He boots up the ancient computer and waits, chanting \u201ccome on, come on, come on\u201d as it stirs slowly into life. Once its finally gotten past its Windows 98 loading screen, Dan opens the hotel database and types in Phil Novokoric, scrolling through a blur of details until he finds a mobile number. Praying it\u2019s the right one, Dan lifts the receiver of the landline, and punches it in.</p><p>It rings for at least three minutes, and Dan is convinced that Phil must have left the phone in his room, or is unable to hear it above the wind rushing past his ears. And then, mercifully, there\u2019s a click, followed by a rustling noise.\u00a0</p><p>Dan waits, breath held, and eventually hears a faint \u201cDan?\u201d</p><p>In the instant he hears his own name, Dan loses momentum. \u201cY-yes,\u201d he says, jarred. \u201cHow did you know it was- never mind, listen. You\u2019ve got to come back.\u201d</p><p>A pause. Dan pictures Phil\u2019s frown lines, etched into his pale forehead. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook up, you idiot,\u201d Dan says, Phil\u2019s slow, distant voice setting his teeth on edge. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge blizzard coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Phil says, sounding entirely unbothered. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I reckon I\u2019ve still got a few hours before-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a complete moron,\u201d Dan interrupts, louder. \u201cI\u2019m not explaining to Mona that I let you freeze to death while she was away for <i>two days</i>. If I have to hobble out to haul you back by your dumb quiff I will. Get back here.\u201d</p><p>Dan hangs up before Phil can verbalise whatever smarmy retort was surely on the tip of his tongue. His heart thumps loudly, and he lifts his thumb to his mouth, chewing on the nail. He decides to go up to the mezzanine and watch for Phil on the balcony. This idea, which seemed great in his mind, is dispelled over the next half hour as a thick, almost opaque gauze of white descends gradually over the landscape. He stays out on the balcony, peering over the railing, for as long as he can before snowy wind whipping him drives him back inside. He spends the next ten minutes googling what criteria must be met for a snowstorm to be categorised as a blizzard, and then freaking out.</p><p>Just as he\u2019s debating who to call - Mona, Kaspar, mountain rescue, his mother - the sound of the front door slamming open almost makes Dan scream in relief. He jogs down to the lobby as fast as possible on his injured foot; upon seeing Phil, his red jacket almost obscured by the layer of thick snow that covers it, Dan picks up the nearest object - the hotel brochure on the desk - and hurls it at him.</p><p>\u201cYou <i>prick</i>!\u201d</p><p>Phil removes his sunglasses, which are completely frosted over with snow. \u201cUh, ow.\u201d</p><p>The brochure had only skimmed his arm, then fallen disappointingly to the floor. Dan doesn\u2019t even entertain the thought of apologising. \u201cWhat the fuck are you playing at? You could have <i>died</i>.\u201d</p><p>Phil snorts, looking away. \u201cYou were <i>definitely </i>a drama kid.\u201d</p><p>Incensed by the typical evasion, Dan steps into Phil\u2019s space in an attempt to appear menacing. He may have more of an intimidating aura than he imagines, as Phil reacts by taking a hasty, somewhat alarmed, step backwards. Dan tries not to let this deter him.</p><p>\u201cWould it kill you to just- just- say you\u2019re sorry?\u201d His fists clench by his sides.</p><p>Phil\u2019s chin juts out. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>The next words die on Dan\u2019s tongue. He gets a distinct feeling that Phil is forcing himself not to let his eyes fall to Dan\u2019s mouth. His shoulders sag, and he steps out of Phil\u2019s bubble, wary of some charge between them that he can\u2019t articulate. He realises for the first time that Phil is shivering.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re practically frozen,\u201d Dan says, accusatorially. \u201cCome upstairs for God\u2019s sake. I\u2019ll make coffee.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>Sat at one of the small tables, opposite an uncomfortable-looking, still slightly frosty Phil, Dan tries to convey an air of general disapproval and irritation in the way he sips his coffee. He\u2019s warmed up some tomato soup he\u2019d found in a tin in the cupboard, and has put a bowl of it in front of Phil, along with a bread roll he\u2019d hastily defrosted in the microwave. It\u2019s probably still frozen in the middle - much like Phil.</p><p>To Dan\u2019s surprise, Phil picks up the spoon and swirls it in the soup. Dan waits, expectantly, but he makes no move to actually lift any to his mouth.</p><p>A frustrated sigh leaves Dan\u2019s mouth before he can stop it. \u201cI think we need to talk about yesterday.\u201d</p><p>The spoon clatters into the bowl, sending a few tiny specks of blood orange soup over the table. \u201cWhat about yesterday?\u201d</p><p>Dan avoids his eye, leaning back in the chair. \u201cLook, obviously there are some feelings of guilt here-\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Phil interrupts, hotly. \u201cSo just apologise and we\u2019ll get it over with.\u201d</p><p>Dan blanches, sure he\u2019s misheard. \u201cYou want <i>me</i> to apologise?!\u201d</p><p>Phil says nothing, but moves his attention to the macchiato Dan made him, shifting the mug from hand to hand as it\u2019s still too hot to drink.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I meant to be apologising for, exactly?\u201d Dan asks, having trouble keeping a lid on his sudden fury. \u201cHaving brittle ankles that snap in your stupid, weird skis? Getting too easily offended by your constant barrage of criticism? Or maybe somehow tripping you up in the hallway so that you stumbled and accidentally smashed your lips into mine?\u201d</p><p>At this last question, Phil slams his mug down, sloshing coffee everywhere, and leans across the table, eyes hard. \u201cI\u2019m <i>married</i>. Married! Do you understand that?\u201d</p><p>A touch concerned that perhaps his sarcastic speech had crossed a line, given the severity of Phil\u2019s reaction, Dan leans backwards, taking a pause before answering. \u201cUm\u2026 yes. It\u2019s pretty much all anyone goes on about round here, or in the news apparently-\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen kindly tell me what the fuck you\u2019re playing at,\u201d Phil interrupts, far louder than necessary. He takes a deep breath, then exhales through his nose, obviously trying to keep calm as well. \u201cLook,\u201d he says through gritted teeth. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if there\u2019s been some misunderstanding here, but I am in a committed relationship of three years. I\u2019ve vowed to spend my life with Nikolai-\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on, hold on,\u201d Dan cries, ears ringing. \u201cI\u2019m not the one misunderstanding things here. You kissed <i>me</i>!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, and you recoiled like a burned heifer,\u201d he sneers, dripping with sarcasm.</p><p>Dan splutters, flushing. He sets his coffee down, wrought iron gates slamming down protectively over his memories of last night\u2019s proceedings. \u201cI- I was surprised!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, <i>so</i> surprising that after flirting at me all day-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?! I was not <i>flirting</i>-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made me carry you back to the hotel!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause your stupid skis nearly broke my ankle!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about unloading your tragic little backstory on me in the hot tub?\u201d</p><p>Dan is seconds away from throwing more objects, and this time the nearest ones are equipped with potential scalding damage. \u201cWe were just <i>talking,</i> you absolute cock. Excuse me for thinking you were actually interested.\u201d</p><p>Phil rolls his eyes, as if the very idea of this is preposterous. \u201cDon\u2019t be obtuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God! You are such a snobbish asshole!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, forget it!\u201d Phil shouts, standing up so abruptly that the table rattles, and more coffee and soup spills everywhere, starting to drip off the edges to the carpet. \u201cLet\u2019s just wait out this fucking storm in separate rooms from now on. If I have to spend another minute with you I\u2019m gonna march back out into the blizzard and let it take me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine by me!\u201d Dan replies shrilly, though Phil is already stalking off to the stairs, abandoning his coffee and soup, both untouched.</p><p>It shouldn\u2019t bother Dan, shaking with rage as he is, that he knows Phil hasn\u2019t eaten a damn thing since yesterday morning. If he wants to starve himself for no good reason it\u2019s his own damn problem. It\u2019s not as if Dan isn\u2019t constantly making him plenty of food he could eat. He gathers the bowl and mugs and takes them into the kitchen (he\u2019d like to say he stormed in there, but his weakened ankle means he could only do an unsatisfying limp-walk), then tries to force himself to pour the remains of soup and coffee away. For three whole minutes he stares at the crockery, willing himself to just get rid of the stuff. It feels wrong, somehow, to dispose of perfectly good food and drink when there\u2019s a man upstairs who must be hungry, despite his unwillingness to eat. In the end, Dan just leaves the stuff on the side, too worked up to deal with the confusing conflict of emotions around wanting Phil to suffer, and not wanting him to literally die.</p><p>He limps out of the kitchen with a cloth and disinfectant spray, and begins cleaning the mess Phil had made during his bitch fit. Once it\u2019s done, he heads down to the lobby, deciding the only thing to do is, as Phil said, isolate himself in the furthest area of the hotel from Phil\u2019s room, and distract himself with a task that requires concentration, but little brain power. Searching vaguely through the items on display in Mona\u2019s office, Dan finds a painting with a broken frame that\u2019s come off the wall. He sits down at her desk and mends the hook on the back with some glue. Once that\u2019s done, he finds a broken air conditioning unit, which he takes apart piece by piece until he finds the fault, and can put it back together, fixed. He reattaches the snapped-off antlers of a reindeer figurine, puts batteries in Mona\u2019s radio, and winds her grandfather clock. He\u2019s just sitting down to glue the binding back on a few of the books she has lying around, when the grandfather clock chimes - it\u2019s six o\u2019clock in the evening.</p><p>Dan is sure, for a moment, that he must have knocked the hands as he was winding it, but he checks his phone, and finds that somehow time has slipped through his fingers. His joints click as he walks slowly out of Mona\u2019s office; out of the lobby windows, the world is a dark, blue-bathed sea of white. He stops in the middle of the floor, entranced by the frenzied flurry of snow whirling past the panes. He limps to the door and slides the heavy bolt, feeling a little nervous about the implications of such heavy snowfall. Is it possible to be snowed in here? Will the phones and internet still work? What if the lights go out? Dan has not been told about any fuse boxes or pilot lights.</p><p>As if his paranoid thoughts are loud bellows echoing for miles , the phone suddenly trills, and Dan hops across the lobby to get it. Just the sound of it splitting the silence is reassuring, as it means that he\u2019s not completely cut off from reality. At the last second, just as he\u2019s lifting the receiver to his ear, Dan remembers that it could be Phil, calling from his room. The mere thought is enough to have his blood boiling again, and he almost slams the phone back down, but before he can, a woman speaks.</p><p>\u201cDan?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLouise,\u201d Dan gushes immediately, eyes fluttering closed at the sound of her robust, vibrant voice. \u201cGod, it\u2019s so good to hear from you. Are you on your way back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you looked out the window, Dan?\u201d she asks, though she sounds gentle, like she might really believe he hasn\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019m stuck in Geneva until the storm passes. My plane from England only just managed to land, they\u2019ve closed all the airports now. No trains or buses are leaving the city tonight, and there\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019m climbing in a cable car to get up the mountain, despite the fact Kaspar would probably think nothing of it.\u201d</p><p>Dan listens to all of this with a growing feeling of dread. \u201cGod, poor you. How annoying. What about Mona, is she stuck in Geneva too?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause. \u201cI thought she\u2019d have called you.\u201d</p><p>Dan swallows, that growing dread doubling in size. \u201cWhat about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings aren\u2019t progressing as quickly as everyone thought with her grandmother,\u201d Louise explains, her tone uncharacteristically sombre. \u201cThe poor woman\u2019s on the brink of passing, but just keeps hanging on. Mona said the doctors said it could be a few hours, or a few days. She feels she has to stay to the end for her family\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d Dan mutters, heart squeezing in sympathy for poor Mona, stuck in some hospital room with a dying relative, no doubt feeling she has to be the hard, strong shoulder for her sobbing family to cry on. \u201cThat\u2019s terrible. So she\u2019s not gonna be back anytime soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, there\u2019s no way to know how long it will take, but I\u2019d imagine at least a day or two.\u201d</p><p>Dan sighs as silently as he can, mind once again x-raying through three floors up to Phil\u2019s room. Another day or two, at least, alone up here with him and his confusing, volatile mood swings. Based on how the past two days have been, who could say what mad, unexpected thing Phil might do or say next. For all Dan can predict about the man, he could come downstairs tomorrow morning to see Phil hula-hooping on the balcony butt-naked. It\u2019s only when Louise speaks again, splitting the silence, that Dan realises he\u2019s not responding to her, too fixated on the image he\u2019s conjured of Phil\u2019s bare, gyrating buttocks against a backdrop of beautiful snow-peaked mountains.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it been with Phil?\u201d Louise asks, as if she can read the absence of his words. \u201cHave you at least buried his body somewhere discreet?\u201d</p><p>Dan snorts. \u201cThought I\u2019d just leave him outside, let the yetis have him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously though,\u201d Louise prompts. \u201cHave you been managing?\u201d</p><p>Dan thinks for a minute about telling her the truth, that he\u2019s one snide comment away from punching him in the jaw, but decides she\u2019s got enough to worry about. \u201cI\u2019m coping. Just.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a relief,\u201d she says in a sigh. \u201cTell him I\u2019m proud of him for behaving himself.\u201d</p><p>This confuses Dan, but he agrees with a sort of grunting noise. \u201cSo I\u2019ll see you tomorrow, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as the trains are running again, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to fall hysterically into your arms and beg you for a decent meal,\u201d Dan tells her.</p><p>She snorts, and he can almost see her exasperated but pleased eye-roll. \u201cIt\u2019s been two days, Dan. Get a grip. Weren\u2019t you a uni student before this? I thought your kind lived on toast and microwave meals.\u201d</p><p>The mention of food makes Dan\u2019s stomach rumble, and he thinks uncomfortably of the now cold soup and coffee he\u2019d left in the kitchen earlier. Guilt cascades over him, consuming and sickening. He needs to force some food down Phil\u2019s throat somehow, if only to alleviate the nausea filling him head to toe.</p><p>\u201cWhich is why I so quickly became addicted to your culinary prowess,\u201d Dan says, knowing this will make her smile. \u201cAnyway, speaking of, I\u2019d better go feed the beast.\u201d</p><p>She laughs, sounding far more carefree than she had when he first picked up the phone, which makes him glad. \u201cGood luck with that. Wear gloves if you want to keep all your fingers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the tip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you soon, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye, Lou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye!\u201d</p><p>Dan hangs up with a certain reluctance, then lifts his gaze to the violent storm still raging outside the windows. He takes a deep breath, and makes his way to the stairs, not hurrying. He gets to the kitchen and walks over to investigate the soup; it\u2019s got a skin on top now, but it\u2019s basically fine. He finds a spoon, removes the thin layer from the surface, pours it into a saucepan and sets it on the hob to reheat. While it bubbles, he washes the coffee mug from before, then rummages in the freezer and fishes out one of the large pizzas Louise had made from scratch with special non-dairy cheese.</p><p>He cooks it in silence, playing on his phone and refusing to let himself think too hard about what he\u2019s doing, or the fact that the person he\u2019s doing it for is undeserving and will likely be unappreciative. He feels a lot calmer than he had a few hours ago at the table - his little handyman spree had helped his roiling anger to settle back into the low buzz of irritation he always feels when he thinks about Phil. The devil on Dan\u2019s shoulder helpfully conjures an image of being in the bath last night, very much <i>not</i> irritated with Phil whatsoever. Quite the opposite, in fact.</p><p>He burns himself retrieving the cooked pizza, cheeks aflame.</p><p>Dan slices the pizza, puts half the slices on a plate, and pours some of the tomato soup into a bowl. He then finds a packet of Pringles, a big bar of dark chocolate, an apple, and a can of Diet Coke. He puts all of these things on a tray with some cutlery and a napkin, then begins an agonising and slow journey up to Phil\u2019s room, carrying the heavy thing.</p><p>By the time he reaches the top floor, his arms are aching, he\u2019s breathless, and his ankle throbs angrily. He pounds on the door of room eight with his injured foot, not caring anymore that he\u2019ll likely be sorry later when it\u2019s even more swollen. It takes a few minutes for Phil to answer, which is probably a deliberate snub that just makes Dan even more pissed off. The moment Phil is visible, Dan shoves the tray at him, practically snarling.</p><p>\u201cYou have to eat,\u201d Dan snaps before he has a chance to say anything. \u201cI couldn\u2019t give less of a fuck about you choosing a life of martyrdom or whatever, but if my boss returns to find I\u2019ve let you wither away over the two days I\u2019m responsible for keeping you alive, I\u2019ll be fired and have to return to a shitty life, a shitty course, and a shitty family. So eat this, for God\u2019s sake. It\u2019s not cute, or attractive, or impressive to starve yourself.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s mouth has fallen open a short way, but he doesn\u2019t make any move to try and give the tray back. His wide blue eyes are locked on Dan, but Dan is already staggering back down the hall as best he can. He\u2019s sure he looks an absolute prat, barely able to make it without a stabilising hand on the wall, but he doesn\u2019t care.</p><p>He waits, not stopping, for the inevitable retort echoing after him, but it never comes.</p><p><b>(<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183634739921/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Nine</a>!)</b></p>",

It takes considerable time and effort, despite the aid of Phil&rsquo;s ski pole.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Ugh, sit down Gandalf,&rdquo; Phil groans, then jumps down from where he&rsquo;s perched on the desk. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;</p><p>He snatches the ski pole from Dan&rsquo;s hand, then ushers him impatiently into the&nbsp; chair behind the desk; Dan thinks about indignantly asserting that he&rsquo;s perfectly capable, but the champagne is still pleasantly fizzing around his edges, and he can&rsquo;t summon enough energy to argue. Plus, it is quite painful trying to do all the many closing tasks on what he strongly suspects is a sprained ankle. He slumps in the chair, deciding to revel in the unusual sight of Phil Novokoric doing actual physical labour. He watches, trying not to seem too smug, as Phil heads into the back office to switch the lights off and lock the door, then gather the skis and poles they left haphazardly on the lobby floor, and stack them neatly against the wall.</p><p>Finally, Phil returns to the desk, inclines his head towards the stairs, and holds out a hand. Stunned, Dan hesitates, but slips his own into it. Phil&rsquo;s skin is pleasantly warm, with a softness that Dan assumes comes from never having to lift a finger. Nevertheless, he allows Phil to pull him to his feet - an action that seems as effortless as breathing to him. Like it&rsquo;s become natural, Phil then slings Dan&rsquo;s arm around his shoulders, and together they amble awkwardly to the stairs.</p><p>&ldquo;I can do this myself-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just shut up and let me help you.&rdquo;</p><p>With considerable effort, Dan swallows his pride, and allows Phil to shuffle him, one agonising step at a time, up to the mezzanine floor. Once they emerge on the landing, Phil manoeuvres him into a chair and marches straight into the kitchen. Through the serving hatch, Dan can see him darting to and fro, spraying counters and waving a cloth about. Five minutes go by, during which time Dan chews his lip and tries to sort through the champagne-bubbled fizz of thoughts in his mind. Then, the kitchen lights flicker off and Phil pushes stylishly through the swing door. He doesn&rsquo;t look at Dan, just swans over to the balcony doors, locks them, then plucks a stray book from a table and places it back on its shelf. There&rsquo;s no more mess after that, as its just been the two of them here, so&nbsp;finally, he turns to Dan, walks over, and holds out his hand again.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Ready?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you doing all my jobs for me &lsquo;cause you feel guilty about crippling me?&rdquo; Dan asks, voice subdued because somehow when Phil acts out the tasks Dan usually finds agonisingly dull, he makes it seem like he&rsquo;s performing a ballet.</p><p>&ldquo;You crippled yourself,&rdquo; Phil replies, grabbing Dan&rsquo;s tentative hand and hauling him upright. Again, he lifts Dan&rsquo;s arm around his shoulders, and together they make their way to the stairs. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing your job for you so that I don&rsquo;t have to spend ten hours waiting for you.&rdquo;</p><p>The alcohol fuzz might be taking its time about receding, but this explanation still seems odd. &ldquo;Why&rsquo;d you need to wait for me? You could just go to bed.&rdquo;</p><p>For a long time, Phil doesn&rsquo;t answer and Dan wonders if he&rsquo;s said something out of turn. He&rsquo;s about to ask something to this effect, when Phil stops mid-flight of stairs, blows a puff of exhausted air out of his cheeks and says, &ldquo;God, you&rsquo;re heavier than you look.&rdquo;</p><p>By the time they&rsquo;ve reached the top floor, they&rsquo;re both in a bit of a state. Phil&rsquo;s robe has come entirely undone, revealing the dark red, clinging material of his still partly damp trunks. Dan has to actively avoid looking in that region, lest he become even more of a sweaty mess. Thankfully, Dan did remember his key, in the pocket of his robe, which he fishes out now.</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Dan says, feeling sticky and unpleasantly warm from being pressed so tightly against Phil for such an extended period of time. &ldquo;Thanks for- you know. Hobbling me.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil falls against the doorframe of room eight. &ldquo;Anytime.&rdquo;</p><p>A strange, thick silence stretches between them. Dan plays with his room key; he can&rsquo;t help but notice that Phil has made no move to retrieve his. &ldquo;So&hellip; goodnight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Phil says. In the blown pupils of his glittering eyes, Dan can see for miles, across the jagged peaks of the alps, tinged blue from the night sky. &ldquo;Goodnight.&rdquo;</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t move. Shakily, Dan makes an attempt to lift his key into the lock, but he doesn&rsquo;t get far. Phil steps forwards, slow and cautious, closing a small gap between them. A waft of chlorine permeates the small space of the hallway. Phil reaches out, his fingers ghosting the edge of Dan&rsquo;s jaw, and then there is no distance between them at all. Phil is unnaturally warm and damp, his skin staticky as it brushes against him. The air seems to be having trouble working its way through the ventricles of Dan&rsquo;s lungs. His oxygen-starved thoughts jumble together, like they&rsquo;re all happening at once. All that&rsquo;s clear is a shocking, sea-glass blue, tinting the air itself, like he&rsquo;s been plunged underwater.</p><p>Phil leans towards him, and softly, fleetingly, pushes his lips against Dan&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s so quick he could have dreamed it, but the sensation elicited - bright pulses of pure, raw energy radiating in the tips of his fingers - are enough to assure him, even as Phil pulls away, that it was very real.</p><p>A look of alarm settles itself over Phil&rsquo;s features. &ldquo;Shit,&rdquo; he whispers, then pulls out his key from his pocket, opens the door to his room, and darts inside.</p><p>*</p><p>For the first night since he set foot in The Secret of the Alps, Dan feels no desire to cry once the door of his room closes behind him. In a daze only partly induced by the champagne, Dan wanders into the ensuite bathroom, eyes glossing over his flushed reflection in the mirror. Without thinking, he immediately begins filling the bath, as if he is being controlled by some higher, unseen force. It&rsquo;s nonsensical to climb into yet another tub of warm water, especially as he should be sleeping right now, but he feels an overwhelming urge to be buoyant, naked, weightless. When the bath is only halfway full, Dan slips out of the robe, pushes his trunks down his legs, and steps in. He lies back, head lolling against the ceramic edge, and closes his eyes.</p><p>Against the steady trickle of the water running from the faucet, slowly immersing him in a pool of warmth, Dan sees, in the darkness of his closed lids, Phil&rsquo;s face hovering above him. He is leaning in, a thousand secrets nestled in the seam slashed between his full lips. As the warmth engulfs Dan inch by inch, he relives every twitch of his nerves, every palpitation of his frantic heart. Against his mouth, he feels a kiss as soft and fleeting as the page of a book skimming his fingertip. Phil&rsquo;s mouth had been hot, and moist, conjuring a bolt of lightning so fierce in Dan&rsquo;s chest that his veins still hum with electricity.</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t realise he&rsquo;s touching himself until his eyes flicker open, and he sees, in the clear water, his own hand moving steadily over his cock. A shudder of <i>wrong</i>ness courses through him, stirring that blinding electric pulse into a frenzy. His toes curl against the lip of the bath as his teeth sink into his lower lip. He imagines two glacial blue eyes fixed on him, and he moans, louder than he intends. He jerks faster, his other hand gripping the edge of the bath.</p><p>&ldquo;Phil,&rdquo; he groans through gritted teeth, and comes, violently, a loud splash resounding through the bathroom as he writhes through the orgasm. &ldquo;Phil,&rdquo; he breathes again as the tremors undulate through his body, and he stills.</p><p>Just then, the water begins to spill over the edge of the bath, pouring in cascades to the tiled floor.</p><p>*</p><p>Dan wakes up in a marginally less unpleasant way than normal, as the light that usually streams across his face is dull and shadowy this morning. His mouth is dry and gummy, and he has a general feeling of grogginess that he associates with his days as a University fresher. Limping into the bathroom to wash the feeling away, he steps straight through a puddle, and balks for a moment before remembering the&hellip; incident last night.</p><p>He peers down at the water between his toes, the ghost of a kiss fluttering against his lips. It takes a full four and a half minutes for his brain to click back into action, and when it does, his heart doesn&rsquo;t stop racing for ten more. He stares into his own eyes as he brushes his teeth, his mind a carousel of &lsquo;<i>how, why, how, why</i>&rsquo;. Perhaps all of yesterday had been some mad dream induced by the scant oxygen up here, and today is actually Saturday again.</p><p>Dan spits out a glob of toothpaste. Behind the peppermint freshness, he can still taste the hint of tart sweetness gleaned from Phil&rsquo;s lips. There&rsquo;s just no way he could have dreamed such intensity, no matter how delirious the cold and the adrenaline of his impromptu ski session had made him.</p><p>As he dresses himself, Dan glances out of the window and notices a familiar blob of crimson splintering the white horizon. He checks his phone. It&rsquo;s still early, yet Phil is already out on the slopes. The sight of him trekking out without so much as asking Dan along feels mildly insulting for about twenty seconds, and then he remembers how dreadful the whole experience had been yesterday, and the annoyance dissipates. Besides, his ankle is still nowhere near up to another round.&nbsp;</p><p>He heads downstairs, glad of the stretch of time ahead that will be mercifully devoid of unbearably awkward, post-drunken-kiss conversations over cornflakes. Nevertheless, the emptiness pressing in from every wall of this place is decidedly unnerving. In an effort to dispel the quiet, Dan switches on the TV in the mezzanine lounge, letting it play in the background whilst he turns on lights and cookers and unlocks doors. The monotonous buzz of the newscaster&rsquo;s voice does help him to relax a bit, and he heads into the kitchen to make coffee and something to eat. As he spoons Crunchy Nut into his mouth, leant against the kitchen counter, Dan watches the news through the serving hatch, only half listening.</p><p>The channel he&rsquo;s found is in English thankfully, though the anchorman&rsquo;s accent is as thick as Kaspar&rsquo;s, so Dan can only make out about two thirds of what he&rsquo;s saying. The grogginess that still sits heavily around his shoulders doesn&rsquo;t help things; it&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s donned an ephemeral cloak, stitched together with remnants of perplexity over the entirety of yesterday, and anxiety about what today has in store. It&rsquo;s only as the words &lsquo;oncoming&rsquo; and &lsquo;blizzard&rsquo; leave the newscaster&rsquo;s lips for the second time that Dan&rsquo;s mind focuses itself, and he lowers the spoon to listen properly.</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;reports of the worst blizzard Switzerland has seen in some years. Although the majority of the storm will be shielded by the mountains, it is not advised to make any long, unnecessary journeys until it has passed. Please stay indoors if you can, and do not take any risks&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Dan tunes out, heart thumping in sudden alarm. His overwrought brain fires a rapid blitz of images at him: a wall of snowfall engulfing Phil as he trudges back to the hotel, Phil being swept along by a ferocious wind and plummeting off the mountain, Phil skiing directly into a boulder, injuring himself and freezing slowly in a swirling ice storm.</p><p>Dan chucks his bowl into the sink and runs to the front desk, ankle throbbing in protest as he moves on it so carelessly. He boots up the ancient computer and waits, chanting &ldquo;come on, come on, come on&rdquo; as it stirs slowly into life. Once its finally gotten past its Windows 98 loading screen, Dan opens the hotel database and types in Phil Novokoric, scrolling through a blur of details until he finds a mobile number. Praying it&rsquo;s the right one, Dan lifts the receiver of the landline, and punches it in.</p><p>It rings for at least three minutes, and Dan is convinced that Phil must have left the phone in his room, or is unable to hear it above the wind rushing past his ears. And then, mercifully, there&rsquo;s a click, followed by a rustling noise.&nbsp;</p><p>Dan waits, breath held, and eventually hears a faint &ldquo;Dan?&rdquo;</p><p>In the instant he hears his own name, Dan loses momentum. &ldquo;Y-yes,&rdquo; he says, jarred. &ldquo;How did you know it was- never mind, listen. You&rsquo;ve got to come back.&rdquo;</p><p>A pause. Dan pictures Phil&rsquo;s frown lines, etched into his pale forehead. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Look up, you idiot,&rdquo; Dan says, Phil&rsquo;s slow, distant voice setting his teeth on edge. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a huge blizzard coming.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Phil says, sounding entirely unbothered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine. I reckon I&rsquo;ve still got a few hours before-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a complete moron,&rdquo; Dan interrupts, louder. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not explaining to Mona that I let you freeze to death while she was away for <i>two days</i>. If I have to hobble out to haul you back by your dumb quiff I will. Get back here.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan hangs up before Phil can verbalise whatever smarmy retort was surely on the tip of his tongue. His heart thumps loudly, and he lifts his thumb to his mouth, chewing on the nail. He decides to go up to the mezzanine and watch for Phil on the balcony. This idea, which seemed great in his mind, is dispelled over the next half hour as a thick, almost opaque gauze of white descends gradually over the landscape. He stays out on the balcony, peering over the railing, for as long as he can before snowy wind whipping him drives him back inside. He spends the next ten minutes googling what criteria must be met for a snowstorm to be categorised as a blizzard, and then freaking out.</p><p>Just as he&rsquo;s debating who to call - Mona, Kaspar, mountain rescue, his mother - the sound of the front door slamming open almost makes Dan scream in relief. He jogs down to the lobby as fast as possible on his injured foot; upon seeing Phil, his red jacket almost obscured by the layer of thick snow that covers it, Dan picks up the nearest object - the hotel brochure on the desk - and hurls it at him.</p><p>&ldquo;You <i>prick</i>!&rdquo;</p><p>Phil removes his sunglasses, which are completely frosted over with snow. &ldquo;Uh, ow.&rdquo;</p><p>The brochure had only skimmed his arm, then fallen disappointingly to the floor. Dan doesn&rsquo;t even entertain the thought of apologising. &ldquo;What the fuck are you playing at? You could have <i>died</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil snorts, looking away. &ldquo;You were <i>definitely </i>a drama kid.&rdquo;</p><p>Incensed by the typical evasion, Dan steps into Phil&rsquo;s space in an attempt to appear menacing. He may have more of an intimidating aura than he imagines, as Phil reacts by taking a hasty, somewhat alarmed, step backwards. Dan tries not to let this deter him.</p><p>&ldquo;Would it kill you to just- just- say you&rsquo;re sorry?&rdquo; His fists clench by his sides.</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s chin juts out. &ldquo;For what?&rdquo;</p><p>The next words die on Dan&rsquo;s tongue. He gets a distinct feeling that Phil is forcing himself not to let his eyes fall to Dan&rsquo;s mouth. His shoulders sag, and he steps out of Phil&rsquo;s bubble, wary of some charge between them that he can&rsquo;t articulate. He realises for the first time that Phil is shivering.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re practically frozen,&rdquo; Dan says, accusatorially. &ldquo;Come upstairs for God&rsquo;s sake. I&rsquo;ll make coffee.&rdquo;</p><p>*</p><p>Sat at one of the small tables, opposite an uncomfortable-looking, still slightly frosty Phil, Dan tries to convey an air of general disapproval and irritation in the way he sips his coffee. He&rsquo;s warmed up some tomato soup he&rsquo;d found in a tin in the cupboard, and has put a bowl of it in front of Phil, along with a bread roll he&rsquo;d hastily defrosted in the microwave. It&rsquo;s probably still frozen in the middle - much like Phil.</p><p>To Dan&rsquo;s surprise, Phil picks up the spoon and swirls it in the soup. Dan waits, expectantly, but he makes no move to actually lift any to his mouth.</p><p>A frustrated sigh leaves Dan&rsquo;s mouth before he can stop it. &ldquo;I think we need to talk about yesterday.&rdquo;</p><p>The spoon clatters into the bowl, sending a few tiny specks of blood orange soup over the table. &ldquo;What about yesterday?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan avoids his eye, leaning back in the chair. &ldquo;Look, obviously there are some feelings of guilt here-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Phil interrupts, hotly. &ldquo;So just apologise and we&rsquo;ll get it over with.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan blanches, sure he&rsquo;s misheard. &ldquo;You want <i>me</i> to apologise?!&rdquo;</p><p>Phil says nothing, but moves his attention to the macchiato Dan made him, shifting the mug from hand to hand as it&rsquo;s still too hot to drink.</p><p>&ldquo;What am I meant to be apologising for, exactly?&rdquo; Dan asks, having trouble keeping a lid on his sudden fury. &ldquo;Having brittle ankles that snap in your stupid, weird skis? Getting too easily offended by your constant barrage of criticism? Or maybe somehow tripping you up in the hallway so that you stumbled and accidentally smashed your lips into mine?&rdquo;</p><p>At this last question, Phil slams his mug down, sloshing coffee everywhere, and leans across the table, eyes hard. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m <i>married</i>. Married! Do you understand that?&rdquo;</p><p>A touch concerned that perhaps his sarcastic speech had crossed a line, given the severity of Phil&rsquo;s reaction, Dan leans backwards, taking a pause before answering. &ldquo;Um&hellip; yes. It&rsquo;s pretty much all anyone goes on about round here, or in the news apparently-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then kindly tell me what the fuck you&rsquo;re playing at,&rdquo; Phil interrupts, far louder than necessary. He takes a deep breath, then exhales through his nose, obviously trying to keep calm as well. &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; he says through gritted teeth. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry if there&rsquo;s been some misunderstanding here, but I am in a committed relationship of three years. I&rsquo;ve vowed to spend my life with Nikolai-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hold on, hold on,&rdquo; Dan cries, ears ringing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not the one misunderstanding things here. You kissed <i>me</i>!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, and you recoiled like a burned heifer,&rdquo; he sneers, dripping with sarcasm.</p><p>Dan splutters, flushing. He sets his coffee down, wrought iron gates slamming down protectively over his memories of last night&rsquo;s proceedings. &ldquo;I- I was surprised!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, <i>so</i> surprising that after flirting at me all day-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?! I was not <i>flirting</i>-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You made me carry you back to the hotel!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because your stupid skis nearly broke my ankle!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What about unloading your tragic little backstory on me in the hot tub?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan is seconds away from throwing more objects, and this time the nearest ones are equipped with potential scalding damage. &ldquo;We were just <i>talking,</i> you absolute cock. Excuse me for thinking you were actually interested.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil rolls his eyes, as if the very idea of this is preposterous. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be obtuse.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my God! You are such a snobbish asshole!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, forget it!&rdquo; Phil shouts, standing up so abruptly that the table rattles, and more coffee and soup spills everywhere, starting to drip off the edges to the carpet. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just wait out this fucking storm in separate rooms from now on. If I have to spend another minute with you I&rsquo;m gonna march back out into the blizzard and let it take me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fine by me!&rdquo; Dan replies shrilly, though Phil is already stalking off to the stairs, abandoning his coffee and soup, both untouched.</p><p>It shouldn&rsquo;t bother Dan, shaking with rage as he is, that he knows Phil hasn&rsquo;t eaten a damn thing since yesterday morning. If he wants to starve himself for no good reason it&rsquo;s his own damn problem. It&rsquo;s not as if Dan isn&rsquo;t constantly making him plenty of food he could eat. He gathers the bowl and mugs and takes them into the kitchen (he&rsquo;d like to say he stormed in there, but his weakened ankle means he could only do an unsatisfying limp-walk), then tries to force himself to pour the remains of soup and coffee away. For three whole minutes he stares at the crockery, willing himself to just get rid of the stuff. It feels wrong, somehow, to dispose of perfectly good food and drink when there&rsquo;s a man upstairs who must be hungry, despite his unwillingness to eat. In the end, Dan just leaves the stuff on the side, too worked up to deal with the confusing conflict of emotions around wanting Phil to suffer, and not wanting him to literally die.</p><p>He limps out of the kitchen with a cloth and disinfectant spray, and begins cleaning the mess Phil had made during his bitch fit. Once it&rsquo;s done, he heads down to the lobby, deciding the only thing to do is, as Phil said, isolate himself in the furthest area of the hotel from Phil&rsquo;s room, and distract himself with a task that requires concentration, but little brain power. Searching vaguely through the items on display in Mona&rsquo;s office, Dan finds a painting with a broken frame that&rsquo;s come off the wall. He sits down at her desk and mends the hook on the back with some glue. Once that&rsquo;s done, he finds a broken air conditioning unit, which he takes apart piece by piece until he finds the fault, and can put it back together, fixed. He reattaches the snapped-off antlers of a reindeer figurine, puts batteries in Mona&rsquo;s radio, and winds her grandfather clock. He&rsquo;s just sitting down to glue the binding back on a few of the books she has lying around, when the grandfather clock chimes - it&rsquo;s six o&rsquo;clock in the evening.</p><p>Dan is sure, for a moment, that he must have knocked the hands as he was winding it, but he checks his phone, and finds that somehow time has slipped through his fingers. His joints click as he walks slowly out of Mona&rsquo;s office; out of the lobby windows, the world is a dark, blue-bathed sea of white. He stops in the middle of the floor, entranced by the frenzied flurry of snow whirling past the panes. He limps to the door and slides the heavy bolt, feeling a little nervous about the implications of such heavy snowfall. Is it possible to be snowed in here? Will the phones and internet still work? What if the lights go out? Dan has not been told about any fuse boxes or pilot lights.</p><p>As if his paranoid thoughts are loud bellows echoing for miles , the phone suddenly trills, and Dan hops across the lobby to get it. Just the sound of it splitting the silence is reassuring, as it means that he&rsquo;s not completely cut off from reality. At the last second, just as he&rsquo;s lifting the receiver to his ear, Dan remembers that it could be Phil, calling from his room. The mere thought is enough to have his blood boiling again, and he almost slams the phone back down, but before he can, a woman speaks.</p><p>&ldquo;Dan?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Louise,&rdquo; Dan gushes immediately, eyes fluttering closed at the sound of her robust, vibrant voice. &ldquo;God, it&rsquo;s so good to hear from you. Are you on your way back?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have you looked out the window, Dan?&rdquo; she asks, though she sounds gentle, like she might really believe he hasn&rsquo;t. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m stuck in Geneva until the storm passes. My plane from England only just managed to land, they&rsquo;ve closed all the airports now. No trains or buses are leaving the city tonight, and there&rsquo;s no way in hell I&rsquo;m climbing in a cable car to get up the mountain, despite the fact Kaspar would probably think nothing of it.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan listens to all of this with a growing feeling of dread. &ldquo;God, poor you. How annoying. What about Mona, is she stuck in Geneva too?&rdquo;</p><p>There&rsquo;s a pause. &ldquo;I thought she&rsquo;d have called you.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan swallows, that growing dread doubling in size. &ldquo;What about?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Things aren&rsquo;t progressing as quickly as everyone thought with her grandmother,&rdquo; Louise explains, her tone uncharacteristically sombre. &ldquo;The poor woman&rsquo;s on the brink of passing, but just keeps hanging on. Mona said the doctors said it could be a few hours, or a few days. She feels she has to stay to the end for her family&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Christ,&rdquo; Dan mutters, heart squeezing in sympathy for poor Mona, stuck in some hospital room with a dying relative, no doubt feeling she has to be the hard, strong shoulder for her sobbing family to cry on. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s terrible. So she&rsquo;s not gonna be back anytime soon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Like I said, there&rsquo;s no way to know how long it will take, but I&rsquo;d imagine at least a day or two.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan sighs as silently as he can, mind once again x-raying through three floors up to Phil&rsquo;s room. Another day or two, at least, alone up here with him and his confusing, volatile mood swings. Based on how the past two days have been, who could say what mad, unexpected thing Phil might do or say next. For all Dan can predict about the man, he could come downstairs tomorrow morning to see Phil hula-hooping on the balcony butt-naked. It&rsquo;s only when Louise speaks again, splitting the silence, that Dan realises he&rsquo;s not responding to her, too fixated on the image he&rsquo;s conjured of Phil&rsquo;s bare, gyrating buttocks against a backdrop of beautiful snow-peaked mountains.</p><p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s it been with Phil?&rdquo; Louise asks, as if she can read the absence of his words. &ldquo;Have you at least buried his body somewhere discreet?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan snorts. &ldquo;Thought I&rsquo;d just leave him outside, let the yetis have him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Seriously though,&rdquo; Louise prompts. &ldquo;Have you been managing?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan thinks for a minute about telling her the truth, that he&rsquo;s one snide comment away from punching him in the jaw, but decides she&rsquo;s got enough to worry about. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coping. Just.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a relief,&rdquo; she says in a sigh. &ldquo;Tell him I&rsquo;m proud of him for behaving himself.&rdquo;</p><p>This confuses Dan, but he agrees with a sort of grunting noise. &ldquo;So I&rsquo;ll see you tomorrow, then?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As long as the trains are running again, yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to fall hysterically into your arms and beg you for a decent meal,&rdquo; Dan tells her.</p><p>She snorts, and he can almost see her exasperated but pleased eye-roll. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been two days, Dan. Get a grip. Weren&rsquo;t you a uni student before this? I thought your kind lived on toast and microwave meals.&rdquo;</p><p>The mention of food makes Dan&rsquo;s stomach rumble, and he thinks uncomfortably of the now cold soup and coffee he&rsquo;d left in the kitchen earlier. Guilt cascades over him, consuming and sickening. He needs to force some food down Phil&rsquo;s throat somehow, if only to alleviate the nausea filling him head to toe.</p><p>&ldquo;Which is why I so quickly became addicted to your culinary prowess,&rdquo; Dan says, knowing this will make her smile. &ldquo;Anyway, speaking of, I&rsquo;d better go feed the beast.&rdquo;</p><p>She laughs, sounding far more carefree than she had when he first picked up the phone, which makes him glad. &ldquo;Good luck with that. Wear gloves if you want to keep all your fingers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks for the tip.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;See you soon, then.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bye, Lou.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bye!&rdquo;</p><p>Dan hangs up with a certain reluctance, then lifts his gaze to the violent storm still raging outside the windows. He takes a deep breath, and makes his way to the stairs, not hurrying. He gets to the kitchen and walks over to investigate the soup; it&rsquo;s got a skin on top now, but it&rsquo;s basically fine. He finds a spoon, removes the thin layer from the surface, pours it into a saucepan and sets it on the hob to reheat. While it bubbles, he washes the coffee mug from before, then rummages in the freezer and fishes out one of the large pizzas Louise had made from scratch with special non-dairy cheese.</p><p>He cooks it in silence, playing on his phone and refusing to let himself think too hard about what he&rsquo;s doing, or the fact that the person he&rsquo;s doing it for is undeserving and will likely be unappreciative. He feels a lot calmer than he had a few hours ago at the table - his little handyman spree had helped his roiling anger to settle back into the low buzz of irritation he always feels when he thinks about Phil. The devil on Dan&rsquo;s shoulder helpfully conjures an image of being in the bath last night, very much <i>not</i> irritated with Phil whatsoever. Quite the opposite, in fact.</p><p>He burns himself retrieving the cooked pizza, cheeks aflame.</p><p>Dan slices the pizza, puts half the slices on a plate, and pours some of the tomato soup into a bowl. He then finds a packet of Pringles, a big bar of dark chocolate, an apple, and a can of Diet Coke. He puts all of these things on a tray with some cutlery and a napkin, then begins an agonising and slow journey up to Phil&rsquo;s room, carrying the heavy thing.</p><p>By the time he reaches the top floor, his arms are aching, he&rsquo;s breathless, and his ankle throbs angrily. He pounds on the door of room eight with his injured foot, not caring anymore that he&rsquo;ll likely be sorry later when it&rsquo;s even more swollen. It takes a few minutes for Phil to answer, which is probably a deliberate snub that just makes Dan even more pissed off. The moment Phil is visible, Dan shoves the tray at him, practically snarling.</p><p>&ldquo;You have to eat,&rdquo; Dan snaps before he has a chance to say anything. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t give less of a fuck about you choosing a life of martyrdom or whatever, but if my boss returns to find I&rsquo;ve let you wither away over the two days I&rsquo;m responsible for keeping you alive, I&rsquo;ll be fired and have to return to a shitty life, a shitty course, and a shitty family. So eat this, for God&rsquo;s sake. It&rsquo;s not cute, or attractive, or impressive to starve yourself.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s mouth has fallen open a short way, but he doesn&rsquo;t make any move to try and give the tray back. His wide blue eyes are locked on Dan, but Dan is already staggering back down the hall as best he can. He&rsquo;s sure he looks an absolute prat, barely able to make it without a stabilising hand on the wall, but he doesn&rsquo;t care.</p><p>He waits, not stopping, for the inevitable retort echoing after him, but it never comes.</p><p><b>(<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183634739921/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Nine</a>!)</b></p>",

He slumps in the chair, deciding to revel in the unusual sight of Phil Novokoric doing actual physical labour.

He&rsquo;s so hungry that he could practically eat a plate right now. Dan takes off his glasses and wipes off the small water droplets that have gathered on the fogged-up glass.</p><p>Phil has already stepped up to the counter, wallet in his hands. On his lips a soft smile is present. As he opens the wallet something falls out of it. A single note flutters down to the floor. He kneels down and picks it up.</p><p>Against his cold hand, the note shines white, slightly corrugated from being inside of his wallet. There&rsquo;s a number written on it and under that something else is scribbled offhandedly. &quot;Hi birthday boy, I wasn&rsquo;t brave enough to ask you out face to face but if you want to go on a date with me don&rsquo;t hesitate to call&rdquo;.</p><p>Phil can&rsquo;t help but smile, he&rsquo;s never had someone give him their number, with haste he puts the note down the back pocket of his jeans for later. Never had he thought that the cashier would want to take him out, the thought that someone would at all, kind of both feels thrilling and terrifies him. Phil thinks that it would be nice to let himself try and go on a date with someone. Maybe he&rsquo;s a bit lonely sometimes, he admits reluctantly.</p><p>Martyn, Phil&rsquo;s brother, has always had his girlfriend and his mom and dad have always been together but Phil; He&rsquo;s always been alone, and for the longest of time he thought that it was supposed to be like that but now he has the chance to change that.</p><p>He smiles towards the man behind the desk, it&rsquo;s all because of the note. Something in his stomach is fluttering excitedly at the prospect of new opportunities. He orders his pizza and asks specifically for them to minimize the amount of cheese.</p><p>Dan leans over a table standing close to the desk, he&rsquo;s scribbling in his notebook again, something has caught his attention and he had to capture it. He looks up from the writing when Phil calls his name.</p><p>Phil is smiling, he stands leaning against the desk, one of his eyebrows raises in a smirk. The warm light from behind the desk reflects in his quiff. Dan blinks a couple of times shaking his head lightly &ldquo;what?&rdquo; He let&rsquo;s go of the pen in his grip, now perching his palm on the edge of the table.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you going to order?&rdquo; he says dragging out &lsquo;order&rsquo;, questioning Dan with that same expression. Dan laughs nervously scrabbling to get the notebook and pen into his bag already.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I could eat your left shoe right now, I&rsquo;m starving!&rdquo; Phil laughs and for a moment Dan spots the whites of his teeth and a warm feeling is spreading in his chest, Dan had almost forgotten how good, friendly company can feel.</p><p>&ldquo;Why the left one specifically?&rdquo; Phil asks, Dan smiles widely so that his dimples pop. &ldquo;Looks tasty to me&rdquo; Dan replies. Phil shakes his head laughing.</p><p>Maybe Dan&rsquo;s laughing more because he&rsquo;s relieved, relieved that his joke made Phil laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;You, sir, have got a very bad taste in shoes, they&rsquo;re like fifty-two years old&rdquo; Phil smiles tapping the tip of his shoe against the floor. The man behind the desk sighs and glances at his wristwatch.</p><p>&ldquo;Wow grandpa, I&rsquo;ve got great taste in shoes it&rsquo;s more about quality than quantity right? And those shoes look fresh to me&rdquo; Dan says as he walks over, his arms are crossed eyebrow raised teasingly. Phil&rsquo;s cheeks are dusted with a light pink blush, he laughs awkwardly, scratching his neck.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe so, but I&rsquo;d very much like to keep my left shoe&rdquo; Dan places both of his hands lightly on the desk leaning somewhat over it, looking into the eyes of the man on the other side of the counter.</p><p>The adrenaline kick from talking and how easy it had felt to just converse with Phil, has made him brave. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have the same as Phil,&rdquo; he says pointing at his friend standing just behind him. Phil places a hand on his shoulder a frown evident on his face &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m not so sure you&rsquo;ll li-&rdquo;</p><p>Dan shakes his head &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo;</p><p>-</p><p>As they wait on the pizza to be made they get comfortably seated in one of the booths. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe that it&rsquo;s raining so much, it&rsquo;s like the sky has never seen an happy ending. Always crying, now if I could just get up there and console it I would&rdquo; Phil whispers through rosy lips, that he&rsquo;s gnawed on.</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s looking out on the street they just were on, and he envisions the two of them standing there waving at him, he pictures Dan with a smile accompanying his own as imaginary Dan and Phil look back at him through the window of the pizzeria.</p><p>Maybe, he thinks, what he&rsquo;s just imagined is what the customers that sat inside of this cosy place saw. The made-up versions of them looked happy and most importantly, he himself didn&rsquo;t look lonely.</p><p>Phil looks back at Dan who\u2019s looking out of the window, just like Phil himself had done just a couple of minutes ago.</p><p>It&rsquo;s stranger to spend time with someone that isn&rsquo;t Louise than he thought it be and the thought is scary. How dependent on her has he become?</p><p>Phil looks around the place. Although he&rsquo;s living fairly near this pizza place, he&rsquo;s never thought of going here, he usually doesn&rsquo;t go towards the train station so maybe that&rsquo;s why;</p><p>But it&rsquo;s probably more because of there being a small Indian restaurant the other way from his home, that is much closer and their food is awesome for a lazy introvert like him to just take away.</p><p>Dan taps his fingers against the surface of the table impatiently. His fingers are itching, he&rsquo;s used to always touch things, press down keys enabled with letters. Even let them intake his dreams, the haunting clicking sound that follows when his fingers rhythmically press the keys down on the typewriter echoes in his ears.</p><p>He is starting to think that being with Phil for a few days won&rsquo;t be so bad. Maybe he needed a break from writing?</p><p>Maybe&hellip;</p><p>Phil rapidly turns his head awakening Dan from his thoughts, Phil&rsquo;s eyes light up at the sight of their steaming pizzas being placed before them. Just the look of them makes his mouth water. There&rsquo;s a hunger present in Phil&rsquo;s eyes he hasn&rsquo;t seen before, he thinks, for a moment, that his eyes probably resemble the same desire to devour this amazing-smelling meal.</p><p>-</p><p>Phil drops the cutlery on the greasy cardboard. He&rsquo;s cradling his stomach that looks soft and round. He both looks and sounds satisfied and his eyes look lidded. Dan eats the last piece of the crust, with a content hum he swallows audibly. He still feels energized, in fact, he feels like talking to Phil.</p><p>&ldquo;Phil?&rdquo; he asks tentatively as he tilts his head aslant. Phil nods leaning his head against his hand, chin digging into his palm. Phil&rsquo;s head seems so heavy already and it&rsquo;s not that late, seeing from a nocturnal idiot&rsquo;s point of view; Dan seriously has begun to realise how often he&rsquo;d spent the nights at his typewriter than in his bed, sleeping.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh-hm?&rdquo; Phil hums smiling softly as he\u2019s blinking tiredly at Dan on the other side of the table. Dan can&rsquo;t help but smile at the sight. &ldquo;You know when I said I write things?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil chuckles a little so that his resting head almost slips from his palm &ldquo;yeah&rdquo; he smiles then, eyes closed. &ldquo;I wrote a book and I&rsquo;m going to publish it,&rdquo; he says valiant, he&rsquo;s just going to have to re-write it. It can&rsquo;t be that hard, shouldn&rsquo;t be.</p><p>But the minute he utters those words he feels stupid and dumb. Why would Phil even care? But it&rsquo;s kind of nice telling someone about it, even if it&rsquo;s just half of the truth. It&rsquo;s Liberating, like letting go, falling freely, feeling the gut-wrenching tickles when you wait for an answer.</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s eyes shoot open wide &ldquo;you never told me you were going to publish, that is so exciting, congrats&rdquo; Phil smiles widely and Dan can&rsquo;t help but think that he looks good when he&rsquo;s tired, he&rsquo;s kind of jealous actually. He looks like a rat when he&rsquo;s tired. Plus he&rsquo;s got really unattractive undereye bags from the lack of sleep and no one in the whole world can deceive themselves into thinking they&rsquo;re an attractive feature.</p><p>Not to mention the messy curls he has to withstand when his hair even as much as senses humidity in the air. There&rsquo;s no meaning in straightening it anymore, this storm is particularly a death sentence, especially for his hair.</p><p>Now when Phil is smiling so much he can&rsquo;t tell him about what happened, not now. It will ruin the mood and Dan&rsquo;s not sure he&rsquo;s brave enough to tell Phil about it yet or if he even wants Phil&rsquo;s pity, what is Phil going to do about it? He can&rsquo;t help Dan.</p><p>The storm has trapped Dan here, brought the two of them together. Surely this must mean something? Dan was never that superstitious to begin with, but something within him almost hopes there&rsquo;s a reason it&rsquo;s Phil of all people he&rsquo;s trapped with.</p><p>-</p><p>Phil has suggested for them to watch yet another movie and Dan can&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s agreed to it. It&rsquo;s probably because Phil looked so happy talking about the movie, hell, he can&rsquo;t even remember what Phil told him it was about - all he remembers is that smile and the feeling that he wanted to be the reason it grew even wider.</p><p>And now Dan doesn&rsquo;t have the heart to tell Phil to move his leg away from his lap now that Phil looks so comfortable and honestly he doesn&rsquo;t really care anymore. He&rsquo;s feeling warm and cosy under the blanket. Dan&rsquo;s head slowly glides down the material of the cough until his head is rested on Phil&rsquo;s shoulder. Phil looks up from his phone, smiling, one eyebrow raised as if he&rsquo;s asking fondly &ldquo;what is it now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought you were the one who wanted to see a movie?&rdquo; Dan mumbles his eyes starting to close on their own accord.</p><p>Phil smiles, lowering his phone &ldquo;it was actually but I kinda got wrapped up texting with a person that I have a date with tomorrow and I&rsquo;m asking them when we&rsquo;re going to meet up.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan is suddenly wide awake, he clears his throat before asking &ldquo;a date?&rdquo; his voice sounds hollow and it surprises him more than Phil who doesn&rsquo;t seem to notice the change in tone in Dan&rsquo;s voice at all.</p><p>Of course, Phil has a date, For some dumb reason Dan thought that Phil was as lonely as him, it had seemed so almost and in some way that had calmed Dan down, made him relate better two the scrawny black-haired man with blue eyes. But now he felt almost jealous? Not because he fancies Phil or anything, just because this &ldquo;date&rdquo; is going to steal away his newfound friend and Dan is going to be lonely again.</p><p>Which, thinking about it, he should be happy about, really, since he&rsquo;s wanted alone time ever since meeting Phil. But strangely enough he realises that he doesn&rsquo;t want that now and he&rsquo;s actually been looking forward to spending some time with Phil; maybe even be able to forget about his book temporarily. He feels he really needs a break or he&rsquo;s going to have a breakdown.</p><p>-</p><p>Someone is poking his cheek. Dan groans and when he goes to turn away from the horrible pokes his back cracks and he scrunches up his face in pain.</p><p>He opens one eye to see Phil standing over him with a cup of coffee &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already made breakfast so&hellip; um if you want some you can join me in the kitchen, yeah?&rdquo; Dan nods slowly, accepting the warm cup from his friend&rsquo;s hands. &ldquo;Thanks&rdquo; he mumbles, voice husky so early in the morning. Phil just laughs &ldquo;no problem mate.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan sits up in the couch, taking a sip before he unsteadily rises and walks after Phil into the kitchen. &ldquo;Did you sleep badly?&rdquo; Phil asks him, he probably feels bad for letting Dan take the hard and very uncomfortable couch&hellip; again.</p><p>&ldquo;Um yeah&rdquo; Dan admits. Phil hums in acknowledgement, a frown painted on his pale face, he bites his lip turning it a rosy red colour. Dan&rsquo;s quite fascinated by it and can&rsquo;t make himself stop staring, he blames the early morning entirely for his weird behaviour. Hopefully, the coffee will wake him up clean.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe you could sleep with me?&rdquo; Dan spits out the coffee into the mug and Phil hurriedly continues whilst gesticulating wildly with his hands &ldquo;no, no not like that, my bed is pretty big and you could take one side, it&rsquo;d save your back from the ineluctable pain, if you were to take the couch again.&rdquo; When Dan still stares at Phil without uttering a word Phil promises in a shrill tone, uncomfortable for newly awakened ears.</p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t touch you or anything I swear! I just thought I&rsquo;d offer you something slightly more comfortable.&rdquo; Dan nods, his mess of a hair falls in front of his eyes whilst he takes another sip, before answering &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like that, the couch is killing me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Anything else you&rsquo;d like, your favourite food? I thought that we could go shop before the storm, like maybe tomorrow and store some food, you know, so we don&rsquo;t starve.&rdquo; Dan smiles a little, as much he can manage, being newly awake and all.</p><p>&ldquo;Pasta with loads of cheese on top, it&rsquo;s been so long since I&rsquo;ve made that myself at home.&rdquo; Phil wrinkles up his nose and Dan laughs a little &ldquo;what&rsquo;s wrong with some pasta?&rdquo; Dan smiles.</p><p>Phil shakes his head putting down his cup of coffee on the table &ldquo;not pasta, cheese&rdquo; Dan furrows his eyebrows &ldquo;you hate cheese?&rdquo; he says not managing to conceal the surprise laced in his voice.</p><p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s cheese on pizza, you ate cheese yesterday&rdquo; Phil pouts and lours at Dan &ldquo;Pizza is not the same though, it&rsquo;s the only exception, in any other situation cheese is utterly gross&rdquo; Dan shakes his head a fond smile settling on his features &ldquo;Phil Lester, you&rsquo;re an odd one&rdquo;.</p><p>-</p><p>The clocks one am when Phil stands before the door, the button up with a bunch of small hearts littered over it is mostly covered by the jacket he&rsquo;s swept on. Dan walks over to him, arms crossed over his chest protectively. It&rsquo;s cold in the apartment and Dan is freezing, he&rsquo;s thinking of stepping into the shower when Phil&rsquo;s out on a date.</p><p>They lock eyes and for what feels like an eternity they say nothing. Just two blue eyes watching a pair of brown. Dan relaxes, he should feel uncomfortable meeting Phil&rsquo;s gaze but he doesn&rsquo;t.</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s the first to break the eye contact, downcasting his eyes whilst muttering &ldquo;I should go or I&rsquo;ll be late.&rdquo; Dan nods inept, he parts his lips, he wants to say something but he doesn&rsquo;t know what. It feels like a storm is turning everything inside his stomach wrong. He doesn&rsquo;t recognise the feeling and it worries him. Maybe it&rsquo;s anxiety again, he thinks. Dan breathes in through his open mouth.</p><p>Phil nods a little as he turns around, he&rsquo;s holding a brightly coloured umbrella convulsively in his left hand as he pushes the door open. Dan swallows as Phil looks back one more time before the door clicks closed. &ldquo;Bye Phil&rdquo; Dan murmurs to the closed door.</p><p>-</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s eyes meet the dark sky with a smile. Through the sheer plastic material of the umbrella, Phil watches drop after drop fall and course it&rsquo;s ways downwards until finally, it hits the stone cold wet terrain joining the beyond of rainwater.</p><p>He has stood outside the restaurant for about ten minutes now, waiting for his date. The frown that had settled down on his features after leaving his home refused to move, and now he has forced a smile to grow in the dark. And contrary to popular belief, finding a source of light in your life is harder than you think. So the forced smile stays on his face as do the frown.</p><p>Someone knocks on his shoulder just as he&rsquo;s about to give up and go home. He turns around not actually expecting the cashiers face to meet his. He&rsquo;s smiling at Phil with eyes filled with vigour.</p><p>&ldquo;There you are, Phil was it? I almost didn&rsquo;t find you. My name&rsquo;s Charlie&rdquo; he says rapidly, Phil can&rsquo;t help but stare at the Charlie\u2019s mouth as it moves. Never has he seen anyone talk with such despatch.</p><p>Charlie shakes Phil&rsquo;s hands firmly and Phil is left a bit shell-shocked as Charlie waves for him to follow him inside. He shakes his head letting a small - but none the less - smile appear, a sprout that might grow till a full on flower, if Phil is lucky.</p><p>They walk up to a table and Charlie sits down looking up at Phil expectantly, &ldquo;so are we gonna order now? What do you like?&rdquo; he smiles placing both of his hands on the table leaning over it slightly, looking very excited. Phil reflexively leans back a little in his chair, clearing his throat.</p><p>&ldquo;Um&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know, I think I need to read the menu first&rdquo; Charlie laughs at that &ldquo;yeah, of course, sorry, my fault for being so stupid. I guess I&rsquo;m just excited to start this date with you and see what it could lead to.&rdquo; Charlie gesticulates wildly, maybe to hide the blush dusting his prominent cheeks.</p><p>Phil smiles &ldquo;I see, well, I&rsquo;m excited to&rdquo; he admits.</p><p>When the waiter arrives, they look through their menus, Phil is not surprised to know that Charlie has already picked a dish from the menu. And Phil silently wonders how many times Charlie\u2019s been here already. Phil shakes that thought out of his head, the feeling of not being special has settled in the bottom of his stomach.</p><p>He lets his eyes roam the page in search for anything he likes. He smiles a little when he sees the dish &ldquo;pasta bolognese - with extra cheese on top&rdquo;. He doesn&rsquo;t go for that though, another dish catches his attention - waffles.</p><p>About halfway through their meal, Charlie has brought up the fact that his work at the store is just the beginning on his soon to be awesome career. And with that attitude, Phil almost believes him. He really knows what he wants and in a way, Phil&rsquo;s really jealous.</p><p>But soon even Charlie runs out of things to tell Phil about himself. That&rsquo;s when the question suddenly lingers in the misty air inside the restaurant.</p><p>&ldquo;So what do you do for a living?&rdquo; Phil twists uncomfortably in the chair he almost hopes that Charlie notices how uncomfortable he feels about the sudden interrogation but his date doesn&rsquo;t even react.</p><p>He just can&rsquo;t say that he&rsquo;s a YouTuber. He&rsquo;s scared that he&rsquo;s going to be judged. For what, he doesn&rsquo;t know, maybe it&rsquo;s an irrational fear but Phil can&rsquo;t help but feel how it&rsquo;s weighing him down every time the particular question comes up.</p><p>He&rsquo;s always had a plan B prepared, one that often works for people that don&rsquo;t know him so well. &ldquo;you could say that I&rsquo;m a struggling actor&rdquo; he says shrugging. He hopes Charlie will just move on to another subject without any further questioning.</p><p>Maybe that was too much to ask for as Charlie&rsquo;s eyes light up with the mention of the word 'actor&rsquo;.</p><p>Charlie leans forward in his chair &ldquo;like a B-actor or&hellip;&rdquo; his eyes light up mischievously &ldquo;a porn actor?&rdquo; Phil&rsquo;s eyes widen considerably, mouth falling open in terror &ldquo;no!&rdquo; he yelps horrified. People around them give him weird looks and he can feel his cheeks redden.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh&rdquo; Charlie leans back then, straightening his back, he looks a bit disappointed.</p><p>-</p><p>When Dan finally finds the vacuum cleaner in a cupboard, he gives it a smile. The thought of getting into the shower was long gone - the minute he walked back into the living room and realised just how messy Phil&rsquo;s place is, so he thought he&rsquo;d do Phil a favour and clean for him whilst he&rsquo;s away.</p><p>So Dan starts in the living room, lifting up knick-knacks and carefully cleaning under them. He stops for a moment to look at some old photos sitting in frames on the surface of one of Phil&rsquo;s cabinets. One with what Dan assumes is Phil&rsquo;s mum and dad. They look kind and Dan can really see the resemblance between child and parents.</p><p>Phil look like the actual sun smiling back at the camera, his parents aren&rsquo;t that far off from that affinity either. In some way Dan can&rsquo;t help but be a little jealous, Dan has never had that opportunity to spend so much time with the whole of his family.</p><p>So, in one way, Phil and Dan are like the sun and moon. He wishes he was more like the sun, it seems that wherever &ldquo;he&rdquo; goes there are specks of leftover happiness to bask in. At least it feels so when Dan is around him.</p><p>The next photograph is one with Phil and another guy. Dan wonders who this might be and for a moment he queries if this is someone Phil used to date but something tells him he&rsquo;s wrong.<br/>It&rsquo;s not just the fact that it&rsquo;d be weird for Phil to have an old photo with his ex just standing for whomever to see whenever; No it&rsquo;s the fact that they have the exact half smile and the bend of their nose is almost precisely identical. It must be Phil&rsquo;s brother, Phil must have a brother he hasn&rsquo;t told Dan about.</p><p>Dan flips over the photo to see if something is written on the backside of the frame. And there, with childlike handwriting, something is indeed written.</p><p>&ldquo;Me and my brother on his birthday 2014&rdquo; and underneath the text, with a slightly different handwriting something else is added, &ldquo;you can bet your life it was the most ace birthday ever lil&rsquo; bro.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan can&rsquo;t help but smile at it dumbly before he sets the frame back to where it stood previously. If he and his brother only had this type of relationship maybe everything had been different now.</p><p>Weirdly enough, cleaning the living room doesn&rsquo;t take as much time as he thought. He drags the vacuum cleaner towards the cupboard when something catches his attention, the door to Phil&rsquo;s bedroom stands ajar, from where he holds he can see a touch of a colourful wall-to-wall carpet.</p><p>The sun is foraging its way through the window spilling it&rsquo;s warm and golden glowing rays over the carpet and making their way to just about where he stands. It feels like an invite, a red carpet he should walk. Phil would probably appreciate if Dan cleaned his room. He kind of owes Phil after all he&rsquo;s done for him.</p><p>Dan pushes open the door with one hand, the other dragging the vacuum cleaner behind him. The first thing he sees is the big splotches of different colours this room has to offer, everything is so bright and cheerful; the second thing his brown eyes fix on is the camera standing in front of a big bed.</p><p>-</p><p>Phil exhales when the door closes behind him. He&rsquo;s so tired, that date really was something. Phil doesn&rsquo;t know what to make of it. He walks into the kitchen to find Dan sat on one of the stools hunched over the notebook he bought when they went into that little odd boutique with the old but cute lady who&rsquo;d insisted on reading Dan&rsquo;s palm.</p><p>Dan had smiled at her and Phil noticed how prominent Dan&rsquo;s dimples look when he smiles and Phil can&rsquo;t help but think that it is adorable. Dan had agreed even though he looked very uncomfortable as the lady studied his hand.</p><p>He watched her with brown, kind eyes. There was a warmth in them - Phil hadn&rsquo;t realised until now - that always appeared like a glowing fire when Dan was interested in something.</p><p>She&rsquo;d told them that Dan had endured many adventures but that he&rsquo;d left something important behind, something that needed him before time had its chance to run out. She was very grave with how important it was as she tapped the glass of the hourglass standing on the desk. Dan seemed to ebb at her words, his shoulder hunching up in defence, eyes carrying a worried tone to them as he bit his rosy lip. His curly hair laid flat and messy.</p><p>But she didn&rsquo;t stop there, she told him that there is always a rainbow after the rain, no matter how heavy the weather is.</p><p>Seeing Dan sat in his kitchen now makes him wonder if Dan is solving his own problems by himself. If the contact with paper, the constant clinging to words helps Dan relax and heal wounds Phil doesn&rsquo;t even know about, those who are invisible to the eye.</p><p>&ldquo;Missed me?&rdquo; Phil asks. Dan looks up, but there&rsquo;s no smile meeting Phil&rsquo;s. &ldquo;How&rsquo;d the date go?&rdquo; Dan asks but there&rsquo;s no interest in his voice, and Phil has a feeling Dan&rsquo;s not even trying to mask it.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, I guess&rdquo; horribly, the date went horribly. But he can&rsquo;t say that, it be too mean, if he knew Dan better maybe he&rsquo;d be able to tell him but he doesn&rsquo;t have the heart when the guy seems so down at the moment.</p><p>Phil realises that he judges people a lot and he knows that but he can&rsquo;t help it, it something that comes as natural as blinking to him. Most of the time he feels bad for thinking these judgemental thoughts but at least he never say them to anyone.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, good&rdquo; Dan mumbles it sounds like he doesn&rsquo;t really listen but Phil knows he does, the slow movement of pen against paper has stopped but Dan&rsquo;s eyes are still stubbornly glued to the block before him. His eyebrows lower and it looks like he grits his teeth.</p><p>&ldquo;Would you like going and shopping together before the big storm arrives and all the supermarkets close?&rdquo; Dan nods and Phil thinks he can just about make out the glimpse of a smile.</p><p>-</p><p>It&rsquo;s dark out when they arrive. The sky has enveloped them in a hue of blue and there&rsquo;s no trace of any stars, they&rsquo;re all hidden from view by the fat drops of rain still relentlessly smattering down from the heavens above. Dan wonders if it soon is going to feel like the days overlap each other in this never-ending hair ruining weather.</p><p>He shakes his head in vain, the curly, dripping locks of his hair falling back in front of his dark eyes. Phil nods for them to go inside. Dan pushes open the door to the grocery store holding up the door so Phil can walk inside. Phil is folding the small umbrella that scarcely covered the both of them, judging by the state of his own hair. They grab a grocery basket each and move inwards.</p><p>Dan has been feeling off ever since yesterday and it seems like there isn&rsquo;t only a storm on the abroad but one within him as well and it won&rsquo;t calm down. It&rsquo;s getting worse the more he thinks about it.</p><p>First Phil goes on a date and leaves Dan all alone, which should be fine in all honesty. But something still feels wrong and he doesn&rsquo;t know why. He doesn&rsquo;t understand why he&rsquo;s so upset over the fact that Phil went on a date and left him alone, really it&rsquo;s stupid.</p><p>Then later Dan finds that camera, he doesn&rsquo;t know what to make of it. He&rsquo;s confused and it feels like Phil has lied to him though no words have been uttered.</p><p>Dan doesn&rsquo;t want to know what Phil does with the camera, his mind went to the worst possible place in an instant. Breath hitching in his throat and heart beating against his ribcage like he&rsquo;d violated Phil&rsquo;s privacy. He only wanted to help Phil clean.</p><p>He wants to tell himself that the anger towards Phil as well as the shame he himself feel is irrational but&hellip; but why else would he have a camera facing his bed.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not only that Dan is worried about Phil did invite Dan to his bed promising it would be platonic bedsharing what is Dan going to make of it? Is he going to be able to trust that Phil is telling the truth when he hasn&rsquo;t even bothered to mention why he has a camera angled towards his bed?</p><p>Dan has sent his own mind into a spiral of dark thoughts, he can&rsquo;t help but feel like he&rsquo;s almost drowning. Torn by the two sides of either trusting Phil or not.</p><p>Surely no one as adorable as Phil would work with something like that. Or does it even matter how adorable he is? Do looks decipher something like that?</p><p>Should he ask Phil? But if he does, then Phil will know he&rsquo;s been inside of his room. A voice inside of his head argues that if Phil worked with doing porn would it really matter? Would that suddenly make him unreliable? No\u2026</p><p>But Dan would&rsquo;ve liked if Phil told him first - but at the same time, Dan doesn&rsquo;t have anything to do with that&hellip; or does he? Considering that he&rsquo;s going to sleep in that bed.</p><p>Dan sighs, looking down at their shopping list. Phil looks over at him, and for a moment Dan realises how long Phil&rsquo;s eyelashes really are even though you for the most of the time can&rsquo;t decipher that from afar because they&rsquo;re a light brown. His blue eyes watch Dan silently.</p><p>Strangely enough, he realises he still likes Phil even though this dirty secret has drifted to the surface. He still wants Phil to like him. He wants to prove that he can be a good friend. Someone who doesn&rsquo;t judge Phil for&hellip; for that. He&rsquo;s going to sleep in that bed even though strange things might&rsquo;ve happened there.</p><p>&ldquo;You tired?&rdquo; he asks and Dan has to smile a little, he nods but there&rsquo;s a lump in his throat thinking about going to bed&hellip; to bed with Phil. Nothing is going to happen, why does he think differently of Phil because of that single piece of technology?</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;&rdquo; he drawls. They walk over the polished floors, the rows of products standing on their shelves float by in their field of view and comes across as unimportant in their tired minds. They stop when they find a product they&rsquo;ve written down on the list.</p><p>It&rsquo;s weirdly empty in the store, though it&rsquo;s quite late so that might be why. Phil hums a little to the song playing in the background and sways his hips in a barely noticeable way.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you ever just stop caring about people judging you?&rdquo; Phil whispers and challenges Dan with blue eyes filled with something new Dan&rsquo;s never seen.</p><p>Dan smiles sadly, turning his back towards Phil. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, Phil&rdquo; Phil hums at that and it&rsquo;s silent for a while. Dan has time to think that Phil is taking his time contemplating Dan&rsquo;s answer.</p><p>But when Phil places a hand on his shoulder, and Dan turns around seeing Phil with his other hand held out in the air like an invite, Dan raises an eyebrow.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s time to change that - dance with me?&rdquo; Dan wants to laugh it off and roll his eyes, saying something in the style of &ldquo;why would I ever do that, dancing with you- that&rsquo;s ridiculous, Phil, you&rsquo;re ridiculous!</p><p>But&hellip; but he just can&rsquo;t. Phil has the kindest smile painted upon his pink lips. His eyes are so blue they resemble the skies on a summer day when the smallest breeze is a relief for your burnt skin.</p><p>Dan hums then taking Phil&rsquo;s hand in his &quot;show me then, how you stop caring so much, huh&rdquo; Dan&rsquo;s voice is soft when he answers.</p><p>Phil places a hand around dan&rsquo;s back pulling him in closer and if Dan hadn&rsquo;t truly realised how hard it is standing so close to the sun without risking getting burnt, now he did. Dan looks up through the curly fringe, meeting Phil&rsquo;s eyes. Phil squeezes Dan&rsquo;s warm hand in his as they slowly move around on the floor of the grocery store. The music in the background is clearer now that they aren&rsquo;t so absorbed in their discussion.</p><p>It&rsquo;s awkward at first as they stumble unsure of themselves. Phil doesn&rsquo;t say anything when Dan clumsily steps on his toe. But after a while, everything seems to click as they move smoothly around. The two grocery baskets are pushed against a shelf a bit farther away left and forgotten.</p><p>&ldquo;I think that the older you get, the easier it gets to stop caring about what people think about you. See for example, if I think dancing with you is important to let you realise for yourself how people grow and change, should I just ignore that opportunity; just because someone might discover us dancing on some old and probably dirty floor of a grocery store? Or should I reach out and touch?&rdquo; Phil whispers and Dan doesn&rsquo;t know what to say, his head is spinning, the smell of something fruity is filling his nostrils.</p><p>&ldquo;You see, Dan, even if we are lost and confused, it doesn&rsquo;t mean we should refrain ourselves from daring to reaching out to catch opportunities.&rdquo; Dan sighs, if Phil really is right maybe he should let himself.</p><p>Dan rests his head in the crock of Phil&rsquo;s neck and pulls him closer and they dance, just letting the music fill their ears and pulsate through their bodies. &ldquo;I think you might be right&rdquo; Dan whispers against Phil&rsquo;s neck.</p><p>-</p><p>When they reach the cash register, Phil freezes, he grabs onto Dan&rsquo;s arm tightly, and Dan glances over at him. An irritated look fills Dan&rsquo;s features before he sees the discomfort so clearly visible on Phil&rsquo;s face, and his own features soften.</p><p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he mutters softly. Phil shakes his head &ldquo;bad memories&hellip;&rdquo; he says his gaze distant. A frown grows on Dan&rsquo;s features. &ldquo;Do&hellip; do you want a hug?&rdquo; Dan asks. Phil&rsquo;s expression doesn&rsquo;t change, but he nods slowly.</p><p>Dan encloses him, like a blanket. Phil is swallowed by a scent that must just be purely Dan. He breathes in letting it swallow him and comfort. It works, it works amazingly well. Dan hugs him firmer and suddenly Phil knows exactly why that date felt off, why he can let himself so easily be engulfed in Dan&rsquo;s arms. He&rsquo;s got a crush on Dan, it all makes sense now.</p><p>-</p><p>They&rsquo;re laying on the sofa again, Phil has his head rested on the material of Dan&rsquo;s hoodie covering his chest. Dan hasn&rsquo;t asked Phil anything more about the incident at the store. Phil just couldn&rsquo;t talk to that cashier again, the minute he saw Charlie sitting there behind the cash register he could feel everything inside of him go cold and frosty like on a midwinter\u2019s day.</p><p>He&rsquo;d asked Dan to pay and folded up his woollen cap so that it covered the majority of his face. And Dan had done as he&rsquo;d asked without questioning Phil&rsquo;s weird behaviour. Man, Dan must think Phil&rsquo;s behaviour was ridiculous.</p><p>Dan absentmindedly plays with Phil&rsquo;s hair. It&rsquo;s cosy here, with Phil being so close. He seemed scared back then in the grocery store, and Dan didn&rsquo;t have the heart to tell him no when Phil rested his head against his chest at home. To be honest, being this close to Phil is helping him too, It&rsquo;s lessening the distress gnawing at him.</p><p>He closes his eyes letting his head rest against the couch. &ldquo;Dan?&rdquo; Phil mumbles into the material of Dan&rsquo;s shirt. Dan yawns &ldquo;yeah?&rdquo;.</p><p>Phil snuggles closer arms winding around Dan&rsquo;s abdomen &ldquo;you know when you told me you were going to publish your book&rdquo; Dan freezes and he swallows roughly.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; He lets his hands fall from Phil&rsquo;s hair now just resting on either side of him. &ldquo;I see you write in your notebook all the time, wouldn&rsquo;t it be easier if you just, I don&rsquo;t know, borrow my computer? I don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan can feel a warmth blossoming in his stomach followed by Phil&rsquo;s words. &ldquo;Phil, you&rsquo;re the absolute best, do you know that?&rdquo; Phil smiles contented then laughs softly into the warmth of Dan&rsquo;s chest. &ldquo;Yeah I&rsquo;m amazing aren&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p><p>So what if only Phil gets the pun, it makes Dan laugh anyway.</p>",

He\u2019s so hungry that he could practically eat a plate right now. Dan takes off his glasses and wipes off the small water droplets that have gathered on the fogged-up glass.</p><p>Phil has already stepped up to the counter, wallet in his hands. On his lips a soft smile is present. As he opens the wallet something falls out of it. A single note flutters down to the floor. He kneels down and picks it up.</p><p>Against his cold hand, the note shines white, slightly corrugated from being inside of his wallet. There\u2019s a number written on it and under that something else is scribbled offhandedly. \"Hi birthday boy, I wasn\u2019t brave enough to ask you out face to face but if you want to go on a date with me don\u2019t hesitate to call\u201d.</p><p>Phil can\u2019t help but smile, he\u2019s never had someone give him their number, with haste he puts the note down the back pocket of his jeans for later. Never had he thought that the cashier would want to take him out, the thought that someone would at all, kind of both feels thrilling and terrifies him. Phil thinks that it would be nice to let himself try and go on a date with someone. Maybe he\u2019s a bit lonely sometimes, he admits reluctantly.</p><p>Martyn, Phil\u2019s brother, has always had his girlfriend and his mom and dad have always been together but Phil; He\u2019s always been alone, and for the longest of time he thought that it was supposed to be like that but now he has the chance to change that.</p><p>He smiles towards the man behind the desk, it\u2019s all because of the note. Something in his stomach is fluttering excitedly at the prospect of new opportunities. He orders his pizza and asks specifically for them to minimize the amount of cheese.</p><p>Dan leans over a table standing close to the desk, he\u2019s scribbling in his notebook again, something has caught his attention and he had to capture it. He looks up from the writing when Phil calls his name.</p><p>Phil is smiling, he stands leaning against the desk, one of his eyebrows raises in a smirk. The warm light from behind the desk reflects in his quiff. Dan blinks a couple of times shaking his head lightly \u201cwhat?\u201d He let\u2019s go of the pen in his grip, now perching his palm on the edge of the table.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to order?\u201d he says dragging out \u2018order\u2019, questioning Dan with that same expression. Dan laughs nervously scrabbling to get the notebook and pen into his bag already.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I could eat your left shoe right now, I\u2019m starving!\u201d Phil laughs and for a moment Dan spots the whites of his teeth and a warm feeling is spreading in his chest, Dan had almost forgotten how good, friendly company can feel.</p><p>\u201cWhy the left one specifically?\u201d Phil asks, Dan smiles widely so that his dimples pop. \u201cLooks tasty to me\u201d Dan replies. Phil shakes his head laughing.</p><p>Maybe Dan\u2019s laughing more because he\u2019s relieved, relieved that his joke made Phil laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou, sir, have got a very bad taste in shoes, they\u2019re like fifty-two years old\u201d Phil smiles tapping the tip of his shoe against the floor. The man behind the desk sighs and glances at his wristwatch.</p><p>\u201cWow grandpa, I\u2019ve got great taste in shoes it\u2019s more about quality than quantity right? And those shoes look fresh to me\u201d Dan says as he walks over, his arms are crossed eyebrow raised teasingly. Phil\u2019s cheeks are dusted with a light pink blush, he laughs awkwardly, scratching his neck.</p><p>\u201cMaybe so, but I\u2019d very much like to keep my left shoe\u201d Dan places both of his hands lightly on the desk leaning somewhat over it, looking into the eyes of the man on the other side of the counter.</p><p>The adrenaline kick from talking and how easy it had felt to just converse with Phil, has made him brave. \u201cI\u2019ll have the same as Phil,\u201d he says pointing at his friend standing just behind him. Phil places a hand on his shoulder a frown evident on his face \u201cbut I\u2019m not so sure you\u2019ll li-\u201d</p><p>Dan shakes his head \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>As they wait on the pizza to be made they get comfortably seated in one of the booths. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that it\u2019s raining so much, it\u2019s like the sky has never seen an happy ending. Always crying, now if I could just get up there and console it I would\u201d Phil whispers through rosy lips, that he\u2019s gnawed on.</p><p>Phil\u2019s looking out on the street they just were on, and he envisions the two of them standing there waving at him, he pictures Dan with a smile accompanying his own as imaginary Dan and Phil look back at him through the window of the pizzeria.</p><p>Maybe, he thinks, what he\u2019s just imagined is what the customers that sat inside of this cosy place saw. The made-up versions of them looked happy and most importantly, he himself didn\u2019t look lonely.</p><p>Phil looks back at Dan who\u2019s looking out of the window, just like Phil himself had done just a couple of minutes ago.</p><p>It\u2019s stranger to spend time with someone that isn\u2019t Louise than he thought it be and the thought is scary. How dependent on her has he become?</p><p>Phil looks around the place. Although he\u2019s living fairly near this pizza place, he\u2019s never thought of going here, he usually doesn\u2019t go towards the train station so maybe that\u2019s why;</p><p>But it\u2019s probably more because of there being a small Indian restaurant the other way from his home, that is much closer and their food is awesome for a lazy introvert like him to just take away.</p><p>Dan taps his fingers against the surface of the table impatiently. His fingers are itching, he\u2019s used to always touch things, press down keys enabled with letters. Even let them intake his dreams, the haunting clicking sound that follows when his fingers rhythmically press the keys down on the typewriter echoes in his ears.</p><p>He is starting to think that being with Phil for a few days won\u2019t be so bad. Maybe he needed a break from writing?</p><p>Maybe\u2026</p><p>Phil rapidly turns his head awakening Dan from his thoughts, Phil\u2019s eyes light up at the sight of their steaming pizzas being placed before them. Just the look of them makes his mouth water. There\u2019s a hunger present in Phil\u2019s eyes he hasn\u2019t seen before, he thinks, for a moment, that his eyes probably resemble the same desire to devour this amazing-smelling meal.</p><p>-</p><p>Phil drops the cutlery on the greasy cardboard. He\u2019s cradling his stomach that looks soft and round. He both looks and sounds satisfied and his eyes look lidded. Dan eats the last piece of the crust, with a content hum he swallows audibly. He still feels energized, in fact, he feels like talking to Phil.</p><p>\u201cPhil?\u201d he asks tentatively as he tilts his head aslant. Phil nods leaning his head against his hand, chin digging into his palm. Phil\u2019s head seems so heavy already and it\u2019s not that late, seeing from a nocturnal idiot\u2019s point of view; Dan seriously has begun to realise how often he\u2019d spent the nights at his typewriter than in his bed, sleeping.</p><p>\u201cUh-hm?\u201d Phil hums smiling softly as he\u2019s blinking tiredly at Dan on the other side of the table. Dan can\u2019t help but smile at the sight. \u201cYou know when I said I write things?\u201d</p><p>Phil chuckles a little so that his resting head almost slips from his palm \u201cyeah\u201d he smiles then, eyes closed. \u201cI wrote a book and I\u2019m going to publish it,\u201d he says valiant, he\u2019s just going to have to re-write it. It can\u2019t be that hard, shouldn\u2019t be.</p><p>But the minute he utters those words he feels stupid and dumb. Why would Phil even care? But it\u2019s kind of nice telling someone about it, even if it\u2019s just half of the truth. It\u2019s Liberating, like letting go, falling freely, feeling the gut-wrenching tickles when you wait for an answer.</p><p>Phil\u2019s eyes shoot open wide \u201cyou never told me you were going to publish, that is so exciting, congrats\u201d Phil smiles widely and Dan can\u2019t help but think that he looks good when he\u2019s tired, he\u2019s kind of jealous actually. He looks like a rat when he\u2019s tired. Plus he\u2019s got really unattractive undereye bags from the lack of sleep and no one in the whole world can deceive themselves into thinking they\u2019re an attractive feature.</p><p>Not to mention the messy curls he has to withstand when his hair even as much as senses humidity in the air. There\u2019s no meaning in straightening it anymore, this storm is particularly a death sentence, especially for his hair.</p><p>Now when Phil is smiling so much he can\u2019t tell him about what happened, not now. It will ruin the mood and Dan\u2019s not sure he\u2019s brave enough to tell Phil about it yet or if he even wants Phil\u2019s pity, what is Phil going to do about it? He can\u2019t help Dan.</p><p>The storm has trapped Dan here, brought the two of them together. Surely this must mean something? Dan was never that superstitious to begin with, but something within him almost hopes there\u2019s a reason it\u2019s Phil of all people he\u2019s trapped with.</p><p>-</p><p>Phil has suggested for them to watch yet another movie and Dan can\u2019t believe he\u2019s agreed to it. It\u2019s probably because Phil looked so happy talking about the movie, hell, he can\u2019t even remember what Phil told him it was about - all he remembers is that smile and the feeling that he wanted to be the reason it grew even wider.</p><p>And now Dan doesn\u2019t have the heart to tell Phil to move his leg away from his lap now that Phil looks so comfortable and honestly he doesn\u2019t really care anymore. He\u2019s feeling warm and cosy under the blanket. Dan\u2019s head slowly glides down the material of the cough until his head is rested on Phil\u2019s shoulder. Phil looks up from his phone, smiling, one eyebrow raised as if he\u2019s asking fondly \u201cwhat is it now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were the one who wanted to see a movie?\u201d Dan mumbles his eyes starting to close on their own accord.</p><p>Phil smiles, lowering his phone \u201cit was actually but I kinda got wrapped up texting with a person that I have a date with tomorrow and I\u2019m asking them when we\u2019re going to meet up.\u201d</p><p>Dan is suddenly wide awake, he clears his throat before asking \u201ca date?\u201d his voice sounds hollow and it surprises him more than Phil who doesn\u2019t seem to notice the change in tone in Dan\u2019s voice at all.</p><p>Of course, Phil has a date, For some dumb reason Dan thought that Phil was as lonely as him, it had seemed so almost and in some way that had calmed Dan down, made him relate better two the scrawny black-haired man with blue eyes. But now he felt almost jealous? Not because he fancies Phil or anything, just because this \u201cdate\u201d is going to steal away his newfound friend and Dan is going to be lonely again.</p><p>Which, thinking about it, he should be happy about, really, since he\u2019s wanted alone time ever since meeting Phil. But strangely enough he realises that he doesn\u2019t want that now and he\u2019s actually been looking forward to spending some time with Phil; maybe even be able to forget about his book temporarily. He feels he really needs a break or he\u2019s going to have a breakdown.</p><p>-</p><p>Someone is poking his cheek. Dan groans and when he goes to turn away from the horrible pokes his back cracks and he scrunches up his face in pain.</p><p>He opens one eye to see Phil standing over him with a cup of coffee \u201cI\u2019ve already made breakfast so\u2026 um if you want some you can join me in the kitchen, yeah?\u201d Dan nods slowly, accepting the warm cup from his friend\u2019s hands. \u201cThanks\u201d he mumbles, voice husky so early in the morning. Phil just laughs \u201cno problem mate.\u201d</p><p>Dan sits up in the couch, taking a sip before he unsteadily rises and walks after Phil into the kitchen. \u201cDid you sleep badly?\u201d Phil asks him, he probably feels bad for letting Dan take the hard and very uncomfortable couch\u2026 again.</p><p>\u201cUm yeah\u201d Dan admits. Phil hums in acknowledgement, a frown painted on his pale face, he bites his lip turning it a rosy red colour. Dan\u2019s quite fascinated by it and can\u2019t make himself stop staring, he blames the early morning entirely for his weird behaviour. Hopefully, the coffee will wake him up clean.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you could sleep with me?\u201d Dan spits out the coffee into the mug and Phil hurriedly continues whilst gesticulating wildly with his hands \u201cno, no not like that, my bed is pretty big and you could take one side, it\u2019d save your back from the ineluctable pain, if you were to take the couch again.\u201d When Dan still stares at Phil without uttering a word Phil promises in a shrill tone, uncomfortable for newly awakened ears.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t touch you or anything I swear! I just thought I\u2019d offer you something slightly more comfortable.\u201d Dan nods, his mess of a hair falls in front of his eyes whilst he takes another sip, before answering \u201cI\u2019d like that, the couch is killing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything else you\u2019d like, your favourite food? I thought that we could go shop before the storm, like maybe tomorrow and store some food, you know, so we don\u2019t starve.\u201d Dan smiles a little, as much he can manage, being newly awake and all.</p><p>\u201cPasta with loads of cheese on top, it\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve made that myself at home.\u201d Phil wrinkles up his nose and Dan laughs a little \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with some pasta?\u201d Dan smiles.</p><p>Phil shakes his head putting down his cup of coffee on the table \u201cnot pasta, cheese\u201d Dan furrows his eyebrows \u201cyou hate cheese?\u201d he says not managing to conceal the surprise laced in his voice.</p><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s cheese on pizza, you ate cheese yesterday\u201d Phil pouts and lours at Dan \u201cPizza is not the same though, it\u2019s the only exception, in any other situation cheese is utterly gross\u201d Dan shakes his head a fond smile settling on his features \u201cPhil Lester, you\u2019re an odd one\u201d.</p><p>-</p><p>The clocks one am when Phil stands before the door, the button up with a bunch of small hearts littered over it is mostly covered by the jacket he\u2019s swept on. Dan walks over to him, arms crossed over his chest protectively. It\u2019s cold in the apartment and Dan is freezing, he\u2019s thinking of stepping into the shower when Phil\u2019s out on a date.</p><p>They lock eyes and for what feels like an eternity they say nothing. Just two blue eyes watching a pair of brown. Dan relaxes, he should feel uncomfortable meeting Phil\u2019s gaze but he doesn\u2019t.</p><p>Phil\u2019s the first to break the eye contact, downcasting his eyes whilst muttering \u201cI should go or I\u2019ll be late.\u201d Dan nods inept, he parts his lips, he wants to say something but he doesn\u2019t know what. It feels like a storm is turning everything inside his stomach wrong. He doesn\u2019t recognise the feeling and it worries him. Maybe it\u2019s anxiety again, he thinks. Dan breathes in through his open mouth.</p><p>Phil nods a little as he turns around, he\u2019s holding a brightly coloured umbrella convulsively in his left hand as he pushes the door open. Dan swallows as Phil looks back one more time before the door clicks closed. \u201cBye Phil\u201d Dan murmurs to the closed door.</p><p>-</p><p>Phil\u2019s eyes meet the dark sky with a smile. Through the sheer plastic material of the umbrella, Phil watches drop after drop fall and course it\u2019s ways downwards until finally, it hits the stone cold wet terrain joining the beyond of rainwater.</p><p>He has stood outside the restaurant for about ten minutes now, waiting for his date. The frown that had settled down on his features after leaving his home refused to move, and now he has forced a smile to grow in the dark. And contrary to popular belief, finding a source of light in your life is harder than you think. So the forced smile stays on his face as do the frown.</p><p>Someone knocks on his shoulder just as he\u2019s about to give up and go home. He turns around not actually expecting the cashiers face to meet his. He\u2019s smiling at Phil with eyes filled with vigour.</p><p>\u201cThere you are, Phil was it? I almost didn\u2019t find you. My name\u2019s Charlie\u201d he says rapidly, Phil can\u2019t help but stare at the Charlie\u2019s mouth as it moves. Never has he seen anyone talk with such despatch.</p><p>Charlie shakes Phil\u2019s hands firmly and Phil is left a bit shell-shocked as Charlie waves for him to follow him inside. He shakes his head letting a small - but none the less - smile appear, a sprout that might grow till a full on flower, if Phil is lucky.</p><p>They walk up to a table and Charlie sits down looking up at Phil expectantly, \u201cso are we gonna order now? What do you like?\u201d he smiles placing both of his hands on the table leaning over it slightly, looking very excited. Phil reflexively leans back a little in his chair, clearing his throat.</p><p>\u201cUm\u2026 I don\u2019t know, I think I need to read the menu first\u201d Charlie laughs at that \u201cyeah, of course, sorry, my fault for being so stupid. I guess I\u2019m just excited to start this date with you and see what it could lead to.\u201d Charlie gesticulates wildly, maybe to hide the blush dusting his prominent cheeks.</p><p>Phil smiles \u201cI see, well, I\u2019m excited to\u201d he admits.</p><p>When the waiter arrives, they look through their menus, Phil is not surprised to know that Charlie has already picked a dish from the menu. And Phil silently wonders how many times Charlie\u2019s been here already. Phil shakes that thought out of his head, the feeling of not being special has settled in the bottom of his stomach.</p><p>He lets his eyes roam the page in search for anything he likes. He smiles a little when he sees the dish \u201cpasta bolognese - with extra cheese on top\u201d. He doesn\u2019t go for that though, another dish catches his attention - waffles.</p><p>About halfway through their meal, Charlie has brought up the fact that his work at the store is just the beginning on his soon to be awesome career. And with that attitude, Phil almost believes him. He really knows what he wants and in a way, Phil\u2019s really jealous.</p><p>But soon even Charlie runs out of things to tell Phil about himself. That\u2019s when the question suddenly lingers in the misty air inside the restaurant.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you do for a living?\u201d Phil twists uncomfortably in the chair he almost hopes that Charlie notices how uncomfortable he feels about the sudden interrogation but his date doesn\u2019t even react.</p><p>He just can\u2019t say that he\u2019s a YouTuber. He\u2019s scared that he\u2019s going to be judged. For what, he doesn\u2019t know, maybe it\u2019s an irrational fear but Phil can\u2019t help but feel how it\u2019s weighing him down every time the particular question comes up.</p><p>He\u2019s always had a plan B prepared, one that often works for people that don\u2019t know him so well. \u201cyou could say that I\u2019m a struggling actor\u201d he says shrugging. He hopes Charlie will just move on to another subject without any further questioning.</p><p>Maybe that was too much to ask for as Charlie\u2019s eyes light up with the mention of the word 'actor\u2019.</p><p>Charlie leans forward in his chair \u201clike a B-actor or\u2026\u201d his eyes light up mischievously \u201ca porn actor?\u201d Phil\u2019s eyes widen considerably, mouth falling open in terror \u201cno!\u201d he yelps horrified. People around them give him weird looks and he can feel his cheeks redden.</p><p>\u201cOh\u201d Charlie leans back then, straightening his back, he looks a bit disappointed.</p><p>-</p><p>When Dan finally finds the vacuum cleaner in a cupboard, he gives it a smile. The thought of getting into the shower was long gone - the minute he walked back into the living room and realised just how messy Phil\u2019s place is, so he thought he\u2019d do Phil a favour and clean for him whilst he\u2019s away.</p><p>So Dan starts in the living room, lifting up knick-knacks and carefully cleaning under them. He stops for a moment to look at some old photos sitting in frames on the surface of one of Phil\u2019s cabinets. One with what Dan assumes is Phil\u2019s mum and dad. They look kind and Dan can really see the resemblance between child and parents.</p><p>Phil look like the actual sun smiling back at the camera, his parents aren\u2019t that far off from that affinity either. In some way Dan can\u2019t help but be a little jealous, Dan has never had that opportunity to spend so much time with the whole of his family.</p><p>So, in one way, Phil and Dan are like the sun and moon. He wishes he was more like the sun, it seems that wherever \u201che\u201d goes there are specks of leftover happiness to bask in. At least it feels so when Dan is around him.</p><p>The next photograph is one with Phil and another guy. Dan wonders who this might be and for a moment he queries if this is someone Phil used to date but something tells him he\u2019s wrong.<br>It\u2019s not just the fact that it\u2019d be weird for Phil to have an old photo with his ex just standing for whomever to see whenever; No it\u2019s the fact that they have the exact half smile and the bend of their nose is almost precisely identical. It must be Phil\u2019s brother, Phil must have a brother he hasn\u2019t told Dan about.</p><p>Dan flips over the photo to see if something is written on the backside of the frame. And there, with childlike handwriting, something is indeed written.</p><p>\u201cMe and my brother on his birthday 2014\u201d and underneath the text, with a slightly different handwriting something else is added, \u201cyou can bet your life it was the most ace birthday ever lil\u2019 bro.\u201d</p><p>Dan can\u2019t help but smile at it dumbly before he sets the frame back to where it stood previously. If he and his brother only had this type of relationship maybe everything had been different now.</p><p>Weirdly enough, cleaning the living room doesn\u2019t take as much time as he thought. He drags the vacuum cleaner towards the cupboard when something catches his attention, the door to Phil\u2019s bedroom stands ajar, from where he holds he can see a touch of a colourful wall-to-wall carpet.</p><p>The sun is foraging its way through the window spilling it\u2019s warm and golden glowing rays over the carpet and making their way to just about where he stands. It feels like an invite, a red carpet he should walk. Phil would probably appreciate if Dan cleaned his room. He kind of owes Phil after all he\u2019s done for him.</p><p>Dan pushes open the door with one hand, the other dragging the vacuum cleaner behind him. The first thing he sees is the big splotches of different colours this room has to offer, everything is so bright and cheerful; the second thing his brown eyes fix on is the camera standing in front of a big bed.</p><p>-</p><p>Phil exhales when the door closes behind him. He\u2019s so tired, that date really was something. Phil doesn\u2019t know what to make of it. He walks into the kitchen to find Dan sat on one of the stools hunched over the notebook he bought when they went into that little odd boutique with the old but cute lady who\u2019d insisted on reading Dan\u2019s palm.</p><p>Dan had smiled at her and Phil noticed how prominent Dan\u2019s dimples look when he smiles and Phil can\u2019t help but think that it is adorable. Dan had agreed even though he looked very uncomfortable as the lady studied his hand.</p><p>He watched her with brown, kind eyes. There was a warmth in them - Phil hadn\u2019t realised until now - that always appeared like a glowing fire when Dan was interested in something.</p><p>She\u2019d told them that Dan had endured many adventures but that he\u2019d left something important behind, something that needed him before time had its chance to run out. She was very grave with how important it was as she tapped the glass of the hourglass standing on the desk. Dan seemed to ebb at her words, his shoulder hunching up in defence, eyes carrying a worried tone to them as he bit his rosy lip. His curly hair laid flat and messy.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t stop there, she told him that there is always a rainbow after the rain, no matter how heavy the weather is.</p><p>Seeing Dan sat in his kitchen now makes him wonder if Dan is solving his own problems by himself. If the contact with paper, the constant clinging to words helps Dan relax and heal wounds Phil doesn\u2019t even know about, those who are invisible to the eye.</p><p>\u201cMissed me?\u201d Phil asks. Dan looks up, but there\u2019s no smile meeting Phil\u2019s. \u201cHow\u2019d the date go?\u201d Dan asks but there\u2019s no interest in his voice, and Phil has a feeling Dan\u2019s not even trying to mask it.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I guess\u201d horribly, the date went horribly. But he can\u2019t say that, it be too mean, if he knew Dan better maybe he\u2019d be able to tell him but he doesn\u2019t have the heart when the guy seems so down at the moment.</p><p>Phil realises that he judges people a lot and he knows that but he can\u2019t help it, it something that comes as natural as blinking to him. Most of the time he feels bad for thinking these judgemental thoughts but at least he never say them to anyone.</p><p>\u201cOh, good\u201d Dan mumbles it sounds like he doesn\u2019t really listen but Phil knows he does, the slow movement of pen against paper has stopped but Dan\u2019s eyes are still stubbornly glued to the block before him. His eyebrows lower and it looks like he grits his teeth.</p><p>\u201cWould you like going and shopping together before the big storm arrives and all the supermarkets close?\u201d Dan nods and Phil thinks he can just about make out the glimpse of a smile.</p><p>-</p><p>It\u2019s dark out when they arrive. The sky has enveloped them in a hue of blue and there\u2019s no trace of any stars, they\u2019re all hidden from view by the fat drops of rain still relentlessly smattering down from the heavens above. Dan wonders if it soon is going to feel like the days overlap each other in this never-ending hair ruining weather.</p><p>He shakes his head in vain, the curly, dripping locks of his hair falling back in front of his dark eyes. Phil nods for them to go inside. Dan pushes open the door to the grocery store holding up the door so Phil can walk inside. Phil is folding the small umbrella that scarcely covered the both of them, judging by the state of his own hair. They grab a grocery basket each and move inwards.</p><p>Dan has been feeling off ever since yesterday and it seems like there isn\u2019t only a storm on the abroad but one within him as well and it won\u2019t calm down. It\u2019s getting worse the more he thinks about it.</p><p>First Phil goes on a date and leaves Dan all alone, which should be fine in all honesty. But something still feels wrong and he doesn\u2019t know why. He doesn\u2019t understand why he\u2019s so upset over the fact that Phil went on a date and left him alone, really it\u2019s stupid.</p><p>Then later Dan finds that camera, he doesn\u2019t know what to make of it. He\u2019s confused and it feels like Phil has lied to him though no words have been uttered.</p><p>Dan doesn\u2019t want to know what Phil does with the camera, his mind went to the worst possible place in an instant. Breath hitching in his throat and heart beating against his ribcage like he\u2019d violated Phil\u2019s privacy. He only wanted to help Phil clean.</p><p>He wants to tell himself that the anger towards Phil as well as the shame he himself feel is irrational but\u2026 but why else would he have a camera facing his bed.</p><p>It\u2019s not only that Dan is worried about Phil did invite Dan to his bed promising it would be platonic bedsharing what is Dan going to make of it? Is he going to be able to trust that Phil is telling the truth when he hasn\u2019t even bothered to mention why he has a camera angled towards his bed?</p><p>Dan has sent his own mind into a spiral of dark thoughts, he can\u2019t help but feel like he\u2019s almost drowning. Torn by the two sides of either trusting Phil or not.</p><p>Surely no one as adorable as Phil would work with something like that. Or does it even matter how adorable he is? Do looks decipher something like that?</p><p>Should he ask Phil? But if he does, then Phil will know he\u2019s been inside of his room. A voice inside of his head argues that if Phil worked with doing porn would it really matter? Would that suddenly make him unreliable? No\u2026</p><p>But Dan would\u2019ve liked if Phil told him first - but at the same time, Dan doesn\u2019t have anything to do with that\u2026 or does he? Considering that he\u2019s going to sleep in that bed.</p><p>Dan sighs, looking down at their shopping list. Phil looks over at him, and for a moment Dan realises how long Phil\u2019s eyelashes really are even though you for the most of the time can\u2019t decipher that from afar because they\u2019re a light brown. His blue eyes watch Dan silently.</p><p>Strangely enough, he realises he still likes Phil even though this dirty secret has drifted to the surface. He still wants Phil to like him. He wants to prove that he can be a good friend. Someone who doesn\u2019t judge Phil for\u2026 for that. He\u2019s going to sleep in that bed even though strange things might\u2019ve happened there.</p><p>\u201cYou tired?\u201d he asks and Dan has to smile a little, he nods but there\u2019s a lump in his throat thinking about going to bed\u2026 to bed with Phil. Nothing is going to happen, why does he think differently of Phil because of that single piece of technology?</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d he drawls. They walk over the polished floors, the rows of products standing on their shelves float by in their field of view and comes across as unimportant in their tired minds. They stop when they find a product they\u2019ve written down on the list.</p><p>It\u2019s weirdly empty in the store, though it\u2019s quite late so that might be why. Phil hums a little to the song playing in the background and sways his hips in a barely noticeable way.</p><p>\u201cDo you ever just stop caring about people judging you?\u201d Phil whispers and challenges Dan with blue eyes filled with something new Dan\u2019s never seen.</p><p>Dan smiles sadly, turning his back towards Phil. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, Phil\u201d Phil hums at that and it\u2019s silent for a while. Dan has time to think that Phil is taking his time contemplating Dan\u2019s answer.</p><p>But when Phil places a hand on his shoulder, and Dan turns around seeing Phil with his other hand held out in the air like an invite, Dan raises an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s time to change that - dance with me?\u201d Dan wants to laugh it off and roll his eyes, saying something in the style of \u201cwhy would I ever do that, dancing with you- that\u2019s ridiculous, Phil, you\u2019re ridiculous!</p><p>But\u2026 but he just can\u2019t. Phil has the kindest smile painted upon his pink lips. His eyes are so blue they resemble the skies on a summer day when the smallest breeze is a relief for your burnt skin.</p><p>Dan hums then taking Phil\u2019s hand in his \"show me then, how you stop caring so much, huh\u201d Dan\u2019s voice is soft when he answers.</p><p>Phil places a hand around dan\u2019s back pulling him in closer and if Dan hadn\u2019t truly realised how hard it is standing so close to the sun without risking getting burnt, now he did. Dan looks up through the curly fringe, meeting Phil\u2019s eyes. Phil squeezes Dan\u2019s warm hand in his as they slowly move around on the floor of the grocery store. The music in the background is clearer now that they aren\u2019t so absorbed in their discussion.</p><p>It\u2019s awkward at first as they stumble unsure of themselves. Phil doesn\u2019t say anything when Dan clumsily steps on his toe. But after a while, everything seems to click as they move smoothly around. The two grocery baskets are pushed against a shelf a bit farther away left and forgotten.</p><p>\u201cI think that the older you get, the easier it gets to stop caring about what people think about you. See for example, if I think dancing with you is important to let you realise for yourself how people grow and change, should I just ignore that opportunity; just because someone might discover us dancing on some old and probably dirty floor of a grocery store? Or should I reach out and touch?\u201d Phil whispers and Dan doesn\u2019t know what to say, his head is spinning, the smell of something fruity is filling his nostrils.</p><p>\u201cYou see, Dan, even if we are lost and confused, it doesn\u2019t mean we should refrain ourselves from daring to reaching out to catch opportunities.\u201d Dan sighs, if Phil really is right maybe he should let himself.</p><p>Dan rests his head in the crock of Phil\u2019s neck and pulls him closer and they dance, just letting the music fill their ears and pulsate through their bodies. \u201cI think you might be right\u201d Dan whispers against Phil\u2019s neck.</p><p>-</p><p>When they reach the cash register, Phil freezes, he grabs onto Dan\u2019s arm tightly, and Dan glances over at him. An irritated look fills Dan\u2019s features before he sees the discomfort so clearly visible on Phil\u2019s face, and his own features soften.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he mutters softly. Phil shakes his head \u201cbad memories\u2026\u201d he says his gaze distant. A frown grows on Dan\u2019s features. \u201cDo\u2026 do you want a hug?\u201d Dan asks. Phil\u2019s expression doesn\u2019t change, but he nods slowly.</p><p>Dan encloses him, like a blanket. Phil is swallowed by a scent that must just be purely Dan. He breathes in letting it swallow him and comfort. It works, it works amazingly well. Dan hugs him firmer and suddenly Phil knows exactly why that date felt off, why he can let himself so easily be engulfed in Dan\u2019s arms. He\u2019s got a crush on Dan, it all makes sense now.</p><p>-</p><p>They\u2019re laying on the sofa again, Phil has his head rested on the material of Dan\u2019s hoodie covering his chest. Dan hasn\u2019t asked Phil anything more about the incident at the store. Phil just couldn\u2019t talk to that cashier again, the minute he saw Charlie sitting there behind the cash register he could feel everything inside of him go cold and frosty like on a midwinter\u2019s day.</p><p>He\u2019d asked Dan to pay and folded up his woollen cap so that it covered the majority of his face. And Dan had done as he\u2019d asked without questioning Phil\u2019s weird behaviour. Man, Dan must think Phil\u2019s behaviour was ridiculous.</p><p>Dan absentmindedly plays with Phil\u2019s hair. It\u2019s cosy here, with Phil being so close. He seemed scared back then in the grocery store, and Dan didn\u2019t have the heart to tell him no when Phil rested his head against his chest at home. To be honest, being this close to Phil is helping him too, It\u2019s lessening the distress gnawing at him.</p><p>He closes his eyes letting his head rest against the couch. \u201cDan?\u201d Phil mumbles into the material of Dan\u2019s shirt. Dan yawns \u201cyeah?\u201d.</p><p>Phil snuggles closer arms winding around Dan\u2019s abdomen \u201cyou know when you told me you were going to publish your book\u201d Dan freezes and he swallows roughly.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d He lets his hands fall from Phil\u2019s hair now just resting on either side of him. \u201cI see you write in your notebook all the time, wouldn\u2019t it be easier if you just, I don\u2019t know, borrow my computer? I don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>Dan can feel a warmth blossoming in his stomach followed by Phil\u2019s words. \u201cPhil, you\u2019re the absolute best, do you know that?\u201d Phil smiles contented then laughs softly into the warmth of Dan\u2019s chest. \u201cYeah I\u2019m amazing aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>So what if only Phil gets the pun, it makes Dan laugh anyway.</p>",

Dan takes off his glasses and wipes off the small water droplets that have gathered on the fogged-up glass.</p><p>Phil has already stepped up to the counter, wallet in his hands. On his lips a soft smile is present. As he opens the wallet something falls out of it. A single note flutters down to the floor. He kneels down and picks it up.</p><p>Against his cold hand, the note shines white, slightly corrugated from being inside of his wallet. There\u2019s a number written on it and under that something else is scribbled offhandedly. \"Hi birthday boy, I wasn\u2019t brave enough to ask you out face to face but if you want to go on a date with me don\u2019t hesitate to call\u201d.</p><p>Phil can\u2019t help but smile, he\u2019s never had someone give him their number, with haste he puts the note down the back pocket of his jeans for later. Never had he thought that the cashier would want to take him out, the thought that someone would at all, kind of both feels thrilling and terrifies him. Phil thinks that it would be nice to let himself try and go on a date with someone. Maybe he\u2019s a bit lonely sometimes, he admits reluctantly.</p><p>Martyn, Phil\u2019s brother, has always had his girlfriend and his mom and dad have always been together but Phil; He\u2019s always been alone, and for the longest of time he thought that it was supposed to be like that but now he has the chance to change that.</p><p>He smiles towards the man behind the desk, it\u2019s all because of the note. Something in his stomach is fluttering excitedly at the prospect of new opportunities. He orders his pizza and asks specifically for them to minimize the amount of cheese.</p><p>Dan leans over a table standing close to the desk, he\u2019s scribbling in his notebook again, something has caught his attention and he had to capture it. He looks up from the writing when Phil calls his name.</p><p>Phil is smiling, he stands leaning against the desk, one of his eyebrows raises in a smirk. The warm light from behind the desk reflects in his quiff. Dan blinks a couple of times shaking his head lightly \u201cwhat?\u201d He let\u2019s go of the pen in his grip, now perching his palm on the edge of the table.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to order?\u201d he says dragging out \u2018order\u2019, questioning Dan with that same expression. Dan laughs nervously scrabbling to get the notebook and pen into his bag already.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I could eat your left shoe right now, I\u2019m starving!\u201d Phil laughs and for a moment Dan spots the whites of his teeth and a warm feeling is spreading in his chest, Dan had almost forgotten how good, friendly company can feel.</p><p>\u201cWhy the left one specifically?\u201d Phil asks, Dan smiles widely so that his dimples pop. \u201cLooks tasty to me\u201d Dan replies. Phil shakes his head laughing.</p><p>Maybe Dan\u2019s laughing more because he\u2019s relieved, relieved that his joke made Phil laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou, sir, have got a very bad taste in shoes, they\u2019re like fifty-two years old\u201d Phil smiles tapping the tip of his shoe against the floor. The man behind the desk sighs and glances at his wristwatch.</p><p>\u201cWow grandpa, I\u2019ve got great taste in shoes it\u2019s more about quality than quantity right? And those shoes look fresh to me\u201d Dan says as he walks over, his arms are crossed eyebrow raised teasingly. Phil\u2019s cheeks are dusted with a light pink blush, he laughs awkwardly, scratching his neck.</p><p>\u201cMaybe so, but I\u2019d very much like to keep my left shoe\u201d Dan places both of his hands lightly on the desk leaning somewhat over it, looking into the eyes of the man on the other side of the counter.</p><p>The adrenaline kick from talking and how easy it had felt to just converse with Phil, has made him brave. \u201cI\u2019ll have the same as Phil,\u201d he says pointing at his friend standing just behind him. Phil places a hand on his shoulder a frown evident on his face \u201cbut I\u2019m not so sure you\u2019ll li-\u201d</p><p>Dan shakes his head \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>As they wait on the pizza to be made they get comfortably seated in one of the booths. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that it\u2019s raining so much, it\u2019s like the sky has never seen an happy ending. Always crying, now if I could just get up there and console it I would\u201d Phil whispers through rosy lips, that he\u2019s gnawed on.</p><p>Phil\u2019s looking out on the street they just were on, and he envisions the two of them standing there waving at him, he pictures Dan with a smile accompanying his own as imaginary Dan and Phil look back at him through the window of the pizzeria.</p><p>Maybe, he thinks, what he\u2019s just imagined is what the customers that sat inside of this cosy place saw. The made-up versions of them looked happy and most importantly, he himself didn\u2019t look lonely.</p><p>Phil looks back at Dan who\u2019s looking out of the window, just like Phil himself had done just a couple of minutes ago.</p><p>It\u2019s stranger to spend time with someone that isn\u2019t Louise than he thought it be and the thought is scary. How dependent on her has he become?</p><p>Phil looks around the place. Although he\u2019s living fairly near this pizza place, he\u2019s never thought of going here, he usually doesn\u2019t go towards the train station so maybe that\u2019s why;</p><p>But it\u2019s probably more because of there being a small Indian restaurant the other way from his home, that is much closer and their food is awesome for a lazy introvert like him to just take away.</p><p>Dan taps his fingers against the surface of the table impatiently. His fingers are itching, he\u2019s used to always touch things, press down keys enabled with letters. Even let them intake his dreams, the haunting clicking sound that follows when his fingers rhythmically press the keys down on the typewriter echoes in his ears.</p><p>He is starting to think that being with Phil for a few days won\u2019t be so bad. Maybe he needed a break from writing?</p><p>Maybe\u2026</p><p>Phil rapidly turns his head awakening Dan from his thoughts, Phil\u2019s eyes light up at the sight of their steaming pizzas being placed before them. Just the look of them makes his mouth water. There\u2019s a hunger present in Phil\u2019s eyes he hasn\u2019t seen before, he thinks, for a moment, that his eyes probably resemble the same desire to devour this amazing-smelling meal.</p><p>-</p><p>Phil drops the cutlery on the greasy cardboard. He\u2019s cradling his stomach that looks soft and round. He both looks and sounds satisfied and his eyes look lidded. Dan eats the last piece of the crust, with a content hum he swallows audibly. He still feels energized, in fact, he feels like talking to Phil.</p><p>\u201cPhil?\u201d he asks tentatively as he tilts his head aslant. Phil nods leaning his head against his hand, chin digging into his palm. Phil\u2019s head seems so heavy already and it\u2019s not that late, seeing from a nocturnal idiot\u2019s point of view; Dan seriously has begun to realise how often he\u2019d spent the nights at his typewriter than in his bed, sleeping.</p><p>\u201cUh-hm?\u201d Phil hums smiling softly as he\u2019s blinking tiredly at Dan on the other side of the table. Dan can\u2019t help but smile at the sight. \u201cYou know when I said I write things?\u201d</p><p>Phil chuckles a little so that his resting head almost slips from his palm \u201cyeah\u201d he smiles then, eyes closed. \u201cI wrote a book and I\u2019m going to publish it,\u201d he says valiant, he\u2019s just going to have to re-write it. It can\u2019t be that hard, shouldn\u2019t be.</p><p>But the minute he utters those words he feels stupid and dumb. Why would Phil even care? But it\u2019s kind of nice telling someone about it, even if it\u2019s just half of the truth. It\u2019s Liberating, like letting go, falling freely, feeling the gut-wrenching tickles when you wait for an answer.</p><p>Phil\u2019s eyes shoot open wide \u201cyou never told me you were going to publish, that is so exciting, congrats\u201d Phil smiles widely and Dan can\u2019t help but think that he looks good when he\u2019s tired, he\u2019s kind of jealous actually. He looks like a rat when he\u2019s tired. Plus he\u2019s got really unattractive undereye bags from the lack of sleep and no one in the whole world can deceive themselves into thinking they\u2019re an attractive feature.</p><p>Not to mention the messy curls he has to withstand when his hair even as much as senses humidity in the air. There\u2019s no meaning in straightening it anymore, this storm is particularly a death sentence, especially for his hair.</p><p>Now when Phil is smiling so much he can\u2019t tell him about what happened, not now. It will ruin the mood and Dan\u2019s not sure he\u2019s brave enough to tell Phil about it yet or if he even wants Phil\u2019s pity, what is Phil going to do about it? He can\u2019t help Dan.</p><p>The storm has trapped Dan here, brought the two of them together. Surely this must mean something? Dan was never that superstitious to begin with, but something within him almost hopes there\u2019s a reason it\u2019s Phil of all people he\u2019s trapped with.</p><p>-</p><p>Phil has suggested for them to watch yet another movie and Dan can\u2019t believe he\u2019s agreed to it. It\u2019s probably because Phil looked so happy talking about the movie, hell, he can\u2019t even remember what Phil told him it was about - all he remembers is that smile and the feeling that he wanted to be the reason it grew even wider.</p><p>And now Dan doesn\u2019t have the heart to tell Phil to move his leg away from his lap now that Phil looks so comfortable and honestly he doesn\u2019t really care anymore. He\u2019s feeling warm and cosy under the blanket. Dan\u2019s head slowly glides down the material of the cough until his head is rested on Phil\u2019s shoulder. Phil looks up from his phone, smiling, one eyebrow raised as if he\u2019s asking fondly \u201cwhat is it now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were the one who wanted to see a movie?\u201d Dan mumbles his eyes starting to close on their own accord.</p><p>Phil smiles, lowering his phone \u201cit was actually but I kinda got wrapped up texting with a person that I have a date with tomorrow and I\u2019m asking them when we\u2019re going to meet up.\u201d</p><p>Dan is suddenly wide awake, he clears his throat before asking \u201ca date?\u201d his voice sounds hollow and it surprises him more than Phil who doesn\u2019t seem to notice the change in tone in Dan\u2019s voice at all.</p><p>Of course, Phil has a date, For some dumb reason Dan thought that Phil was as lonely as him, it had seemed so almost and in some way that had calmed Dan down, made him relate better two the scrawny black-haired man with blue eyes. But now he felt almost jealous? Not because he fancies Phil or anything, just because this \u201cdate\u201d is going to steal away his newfound friend and Dan is going to be lonely again.</p><p>Which, thinking about it, he should be happy about, really, since he\u2019s wanted alone time ever since meeting Phil. But strangely enough he realises that he doesn\u2019t want that now and he\u2019s actually been looking forward to spending some time with Phil; maybe even be able to forget about his book temporarily. He feels he really needs a break or he\u2019s going to have a breakdown.</p><p>-</p><p>Someone is poking his cheek. Dan groans and when he goes to turn away from the horrible pokes his back cracks and he scrunches up his face in pain.</p><p>He opens one eye to see Phil standing over him with a cup of coffee \u201cI\u2019ve already made breakfast so\u2026 um if you want some you can join me in the kitchen, yeah?\u201d Dan nods slowly, accepting the warm cup from his friend\u2019s hands. \u201cThanks\u201d he mumbles, voice husky so early in the morning. Phil just laughs \u201cno problem mate.\u201d</p><p>Dan sits up in the couch, taking a sip before he unsteadily rises and walks after Phil into the kitchen. \u201cDid you sleep badly?\u201d Phil asks him, he probably feels bad for letting Dan take the hard and very uncomfortable couch\u2026 again.</p><p>\u201cUm yeah\u201d Dan admits. Phil hums in acknowledgement, a frown painted on his pale face, he bites his lip turning it a rosy red colour. Dan\u2019s quite fascinated by it and can\u2019t make himself stop staring, he blames the early morning entirely for his weird behaviour. Hopefully, the coffee will wake him up clean.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you could sleep with me?\u201d Dan spits out the coffee into the mug and Phil hurriedly continues whilst gesticulating wildly with his hands \u201cno, no not like that, my bed is pretty big and you could take one side, it\u2019d save your back from the ineluctable pain, if you were to take the couch again.\u201d When Dan still stares at Phil without uttering a word Phil promises in a shrill tone, uncomfortable for newly awakened ears.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t touch you or anything I swear! I just thought I\u2019d offer you something slightly more comfortable.\u201d Dan nods, his mess of a hair falls in front of his eyes whilst he takes another sip, before answering \u201cI\u2019d like that, the couch is killing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything else you\u2019d like, your favourite food? I thought that we could go shop before the storm, like maybe tomorrow and store some food, you know, so we don\u2019t starve.\u201d Dan smiles a little, as much he can manage, being newly awake and all.</p><p>\u201cPasta with loads of cheese on top, it\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve made that myself at home.\u201d Phil wrinkles up his nose and Dan laughs a little \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with some pasta?\u201d Dan smiles.</p><p>Phil shakes his head putting down his cup of coffee on the table \u201cnot pasta, cheese\u201d Dan furrows his eyebrows \u201cyou hate cheese?\u201d he says not managing to conceal the surprise laced in his voice.</p><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s cheese on pizza, you ate cheese yesterday\u201d Phil pouts and lours at Dan \u201cPizza is not the same though, it\u2019s the only exception, in any other situation cheese is utterly gross\u201d Dan shakes his head a fond smile settling on his features \u201cPhil Lester, you\u2019re an odd one\u201d.</p><p>-</p><p>The clocks one am when Phil stands before the door, the button up with a bunch of small hearts littered over it is mostly covered by the jacket he\u2019s swept on. Dan walks over to him, arms crossed over his chest protectively. It\u2019s cold in the apartment and Dan is freezing, he\u2019s thinking of stepping into the shower when Phil\u2019s out on a date.</p><p>They lock eyes and for what feels like an eternity they say nothing. Just two blue eyes watching a pair of brown. Dan relaxes, he should feel uncomfortable meeting Phil\u2019s gaze but he doesn\u2019t.</p><p>Phil\u2019s the first to break the eye contact, downcasting his eyes whilst muttering \u201cI should go or I\u2019ll be late.\u201d Dan nods inept, he parts his lips, he wants to say something but he doesn\u2019t know what. It feels like a storm is turning everything inside his stomach wrong. He doesn\u2019t recognise the feeling and it worries him. Maybe it\u2019s anxiety again, he thinks. Dan breathes in through his open mouth.</p><p>Phil nods a little as he turns around, he\u2019s holding a brightly coloured umbrella convulsively in his left hand as he pushes the door open. Dan swallows as Phil looks back one more time before the door clicks closed. \u201cBye Phil\u201d Dan murmurs to the closed door.</p><p>-</p><p>Phil\u2019s eyes meet the dark sky with a smile. Through the sheer plastic material of the umbrella, Phil watches drop after drop fall and course it\u2019s ways downwards until finally, it hits the stone cold wet terrain joining the beyond of rainwater.</p><p>He has stood outside the restaurant for about ten minutes now, waiting for his date. The frown that had settled down on his features after leaving his home refused to move, and now he has forced a smile to grow in the dark. And contrary to popular belief, finding a source of light in your life is harder than you think. So the forced smile stays on his face as do the frown.</p><p>Someone knocks on his shoulder just as he\u2019s about to give up and go home. He turns around not actually expecting the cashiers face to meet his. He\u2019s smiling at Phil with eyes filled with vigour.</p><p>\u201cThere you are, Phil was it? I almost didn\u2019t find you. My name\u2019s Charlie\u201d he says rapidly, Phil can\u2019t help but stare at the Charlie\u2019s mouth as it moves. Never has he seen anyone talk with such despatch.</p><p>Charlie shakes Phil\u2019s hands firmly and Phil is left a bit shell-shocked as Charlie waves for him to follow him inside. He shakes his head letting a small - but none the less - smile appear, a sprout that might grow till a full on flower, if Phil is lucky.</p><p>They walk up to a table and Charlie sits down looking up at Phil expectantly, \u201cso are we gonna order now? What do you like?\u201d he smiles placing both of his hands on the table leaning over it slightly, looking very excited. Phil reflexively leans back a little in his chair, clearing his throat.</p><p>\u201cUm\u2026 I don\u2019t know, I think I need to read the menu first\u201d Charlie laughs at that \u201cyeah, of course, sorry, my fault for being so stupid. I guess I\u2019m just excited to start this date with you and see what it could lead to.\u201d Charlie gesticulates wildly, maybe to hide the blush dusting his prominent cheeks.</p><p>Phil smiles \u201cI see, well, I\u2019m excited to\u201d he admits.</p><p>When the waiter arrives, they look through their menus, Phil is not surprised to know that Charlie has already picked a dish from the menu. And Phil silently wonders how many times Charlie\u2019s been here already. Phil shakes that thought out of his head, the feeling of not being special has settled in the bottom of his stomach.</p><p>He lets his eyes roam the page in search for anything he likes. He smiles a little when he sees the dish \u201cpasta bolognese - with extra cheese on top\u201d. He doesn\u2019t go for that though, another dish catches his attention - waffles.</p><p>About halfway through their meal, Charlie has brought up the fact that his work at the store is just the beginning on his soon to be awesome career. And with that attitude, Phil almost believes him. He really knows what he wants and in a way, Phil\u2019s really jealous.</p><p>But soon even Charlie runs out of things to tell Phil about himself. That\u2019s when the question suddenly lingers in the misty air inside the restaurant.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you do for a living?\u201d Phil twists uncomfortably in the chair he almost hopes that Charlie notices how uncomfortable he feels about the sudden interrogation but his date doesn\u2019t even react.</p><p>He just can\u2019t say that he\u2019s a YouTuber. He\u2019s scared that he\u2019s going to be judged. For what, he doesn\u2019t know, maybe it\u2019s an irrational fear but Phil can\u2019t help but feel how it\u2019s weighing him down every time the particular question comes up.</p><p>He\u2019s always had a plan B prepared, one that often works for people that don\u2019t know him so well. \u201cyou could say that I\u2019m a struggling actor\u201d he says shrugging. He hopes Charlie will just move on to another subject without any further questioning.</p><p>Maybe that was too much to ask for as Charlie\u2019s eyes light up with the mention of the word 'actor\u2019.</p><p>Charlie leans forward in his chair \u201clike a B-actor or\u2026\u201d his eyes light up mischievously \u201ca porn actor?\u201d Phil\u2019s eyes widen considerably, mouth falling open in terror \u201cno!\u201d he yelps horrified. People around them give him weird looks and he can feel his cheeks redden.</p><p>\u201cOh\u201d Charlie leans back then, straightening his back, he looks a bit disappointed.</p><p>-</p><p>When Dan finally finds the vacuum cleaner in a cupboard, he gives it a smile. The thought of getting into the shower was long gone - the minute he walked back into the living room and realised just how messy Phil\u2019s place is, so he thought he\u2019d do Phil a favour and clean for him whilst he\u2019s away.</p><p>So Dan starts in the living room, lifting up knick-knacks and carefully cleaning under them. He stops for a moment to look at some old photos sitting in frames on the surface of one of Phil\u2019s cabinets. One with what Dan assumes is Phil\u2019s mum and dad. They look kind and Dan can really see the resemblance between child and parents.</p><p>Phil look like the actual sun smiling back at the camera, his parents aren\u2019t that far off from that affinity either. In some way Dan can\u2019t help but be a little jealous, Dan has never had that opportunity to spend so much time with the whole of his family.</p><p>So, in one way, Phil and Dan are like the sun and moon. He wishes he was more like the sun, it seems that wherever \u201che\u201d goes there are specks of leftover happiness to bask in. At least it feels so when Dan is around him.</p><p>The next photograph is one with Phil and another guy. Dan wonders who this might be and for a moment he queries if this is someone Phil used to date but something tells him he\u2019s wrong.<br>It\u2019s not just the fact that it\u2019d be weird for Phil to have an old photo with his ex just standing for whomever to see whenever; No it\u2019s the fact that they have the exact half smile and the bend of their nose is almost precisely identical. It must be Phil\u2019s brother, Phil must have a brother he hasn\u2019t told Dan about.</p><p>Dan flips over the photo to see if something is written on the backside of the frame. And there, with childlike handwriting, something is indeed written.</p><p>\u201cMe and my brother on his birthday 2014\u201d and underneath the text, with a slightly different handwriting something else is added, \u201cyou can bet your life it was the most ace birthday ever lil\u2019 bro.\u201d</p><p>Dan can\u2019t help but smile at it dumbly before he sets the frame back to where it stood previously. If he and his brother only had this type of relationship maybe everything had been different now.</p><p>Weirdly enough, cleaning the living room doesn\u2019t take as much time as he thought. He drags the vacuum cleaner towards the cupboard when something catches his attention, the door to Phil\u2019s bedroom stands ajar, from where he holds he can see a touch of a colourful wall-to-wall carpet.</p><p>The sun is foraging its way through the window spilling it\u2019s warm and golden glowing rays over the carpet and making their way to just about where he stands. It feels like an invite, a red carpet he should walk. Phil would probably appreciate if Dan cleaned his room. He kind of owes Phil after all he\u2019s done for him.</p><p>Dan pushes open the door with one hand, the other dragging the vacuum cleaner behind him. The first thing he sees is the big splotches of different colours this room has to offer, everything is so bright and cheerful; the second thing his brown eyes fix on is the camera standing in front of a big bed.</p><p>-</p><p>Phil exhales when the door closes behind him. He\u2019s so tired, that date really was something. Phil doesn\u2019t know what to make of it. He walks into the kitchen to find Dan sat on one of the stools hunched over the notebook he bought when they went into that little odd boutique with the old but cute lady who\u2019d insisted on reading Dan\u2019s palm.</p><p>Dan had smiled at her and Phil noticed how prominent Dan\u2019s dimples look when he smiles and Phil can\u2019t help but think that it is adorable. Dan had agreed even though he looked very uncomfortable as the lady studied his hand.</p><p>He watched her with brown, kind eyes. There was a warmth in them - Phil hadn\u2019t realised until now - that always appeared like a glowing fire when Dan was interested in something.</p><p>She\u2019d told them that Dan had endured many adventures but that he\u2019d left something important behind, something that needed him before time had its chance to run out. She was very grave with how important it was as she tapped the glass of the hourglass standing on the desk. Dan seemed to ebb at her words, his shoulder hunching up in defence, eyes carrying a worried tone to them as he bit his rosy lip. His curly hair laid flat and messy.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t stop there, she told him that there is always a rainbow after the rain, no matter how heavy the weather is.</p><p>Seeing Dan sat in his kitchen now makes him wonder if Dan is solving his own problems by himself. If the contact with paper, the constant clinging to words helps Dan relax and heal wounds Phil doesn\u2019t even know about, those who are invisible to the eye.</p><p>\u201cMissed me?\u201d Phil asks. Dan looks up, but there\u2019s no smile meeting Phil\u2019s. \u201cHow\u2019d the date go?\u201d Dan asks but there\u2019s no interest in his voice, and Phil has a feeling Dan\u2019s not even trying to mask it.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I guess\u201d horribly, the date went horribly. But he can\u2019t say that, it be too mean, if he knew Dan better maybe he\u2019d be able to tell him but he doesn\u2019t have the heart when the guy seems so down at the moment.</p><p>Phil realises that he judges people a lot and he knows that but he can\u2019t help it, it something that comes as natural as blinking to him. Most of the time he feels bad for thinking these judgemental thoughts but at least he never say them to anyone.</p><p>\u201cOh, good\u201d Dan mumbles it sounds like he doesn\u2019t really listen but Phil knows he does, the slow movement of pen against paper has stopped but Dan\u2019s eyes are still stubbornly glued to the block before him. His eyebrows lower and it looks like he grits his teeth.</p><p>\u201cWould you like going and shopping together before the big storm arrives and all the supermarkets close?\u201d Dan nods and Phil thinks he can just about make out the glimpse of a smile.</p><p>-</p><p>It\u2019s dark out when they arrive. The sky has enveloped them in a hue of blue and there\u2019s no trace of any stars, they\u2019re all hidden from view by the fat drops of rain still relentlessly smattering down from the heavens above. Dan wonders if it soon is going to feel like the days overlap each other in this never-ending hair ruining weather.</p><p>He shakes his head in vain, the curly, dripping locks of his hair falling back in front of his dark eyes. Phil nods for them to go inside. Dan pushes open the door to the grocery store holding up the door so Phil can walk inside. Phil is folding the small umbrella that scarcely covered the both of them, judging by the state of his own hair. They grab a grocery basket each and move inwards.</p><p>Dan has been feeling off ever since yesterday and it seems like there isn\u2019t only a storm on the abroad but one within him as well and it won\u2019t calm down. It\u2019s getting worse the more he thinks about it.</p><p>First Phil goes on a date and leaves Dan all alone, which should be fine in all honesty. But something still feels wrong and he doesn\u2019t know why. He doesn\u2019t understand why he\u2019s so upset over the fact that Phil went on a date and left him alone, really it\u2019s stupid.</p><p>Then later Dan finds that camera, he doesn\u2019t know what to make of it. He\u2019s confused and it feels like Phil has lied to him though no words have been uttered.</p><p>Dan doesn\u2019t want to know what Phil does with the camera, his mind went to the worst possible place in an instant. Breath hitching in his throat and heart beating against his ribcage like he\u2019d violated Phil\u2019s privacy. He only wanted to help Phil clean.</p><p>He wants to tell himself that the anger towards Phil as well as the shame he himself feel is irrational but\u2026 but why else would he have a camera facing his bed.</p><p>It\u2019s not only that Dan is worried about Phil did invite Dan to his bed promising it would be platonic bedsharing what is Dan going to make of it? Is he going to be able to trust that Phil is telling the truth when he hasn\u2019t even bothered to mention why he has a camera angled towards his bed?</p><p>Dan has sent his own mind into a spiral of dark thoughts, he can\u2019t help but feel like he\u2019s almost drowning. Torn by the two sides of either trusting Phil or not.</p><p>Surely no one as adorable as Phil would work with something like that. Or does it even matter how adorable he is? Do looks decipher something like that?</p><p>Should he ask Phil? But if he does, then Phil will know he\u2019s been inside of his room. A voice inside of his head argues that if Phil worked with doing porn would it really matter? Would that suddenly make him unreliable? No\u2026</p><p>But Dan would\u2019ve liked if Phil told him first - but at the same time, Dan doesn\u2019t have anything to do with that\u2026 or does he? Considering that he\u2019s going to sleep in that bed.</p><p>Dan sighs, looking down at their shopping list. Phil looks over at him, and for a moment Dan realises how long Phil\u2019s eyelashes really are even though you for the most of the time can\u2019t decipher that from afar because they\u2019re a light brown. His blue eyes watch Dan silently.</p><p>Strangely enough, he realises he still likes Phil even though this dirty secret has drifted to the surface. He still wants Phil to like him. He wants to prove that he can be a good friend. Someone who doesn\u2019t judge Phil for\u2026 for that. He\u2019s going to sleep in that bed even though strange things might\u2019ve happened there.</p><p>\u201cYou tired?\u201d he asks and Dan has to smile a little, he nods but there\u2019s a lump in his throat thinking about going to bed\u2026 to bed with Phil. Nothing is going to happen, why does he think differently of Phil because of that single piece of technology?</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d he drawls. They walk over the polished floors, the rows of products standing on their shelves float by in their field of view and comes across as unimportant in their tired minds. They stop when they find a product they\u2019ve written down on the list.</p><p>It\u2019s weirdly empty in the store, though it\u2019s quite late so that might be why. Phil hums a little to the song playing in the background and sways his hips in a barely noticeable way.</p><p>\u201cDo you ever just stop caring about people judging you?\u201d Phil whispers and challenges Dan with blue eyes filled with something new Dan\u2019s never seen.</p><p>Dan smiles sadly, turning his back towards Phil. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, Phil\u201d Phil hums at that and it\u2019s silent for a while. Dan has time to think that Phil is taking his time contemplating Dan\u2019s answer.</p><p>But when Phil places a hand on his shoulder, and Dan turns around seeing Phil with his other hand held out in the air like an invite, Dan raises an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s time to change that - dance with me?\u201d Dan wants to laugh it off and roll his eyes, saying something in the style of \u201cwhy would I ever do that, dancing with you- that\u2019s ridiculous, Phil, you\u2019re ridiculous!</p><p>But\u2026 but he just can\u2019t. Phil has the kindest smile painted upon his pink lips. His eyes are so blue they resemble the skies on a summer day when the smallest breeze is a relief for your burnt skin.</p><p>Dan hums then taking Phil\u2019s hand in his \"show me then, how you stop caring so much, huh\u201d Dan\u2019s voice is soft when he answers.</p><p>Phil places a hand around dan\u2019s back pulling him in closer and if Dan hadn\u2019t truly realised how hard it is standing so close to the sun without risking getting burnt, now he did. Dan looks up through the curly fringe, meeting Phil\u2019s eyes. Phil squeezes Dan\u2019s warm hand in his as they slowly move around on the floor of the grocery store. The music in the background is clearer now that they aren\u2019t so absorbed in their discussion.</p><p>It\u2019s awkward at first as they stumble unsure of themselves. Phil doesn\u2019t say anything when Dan clumsily steps on his toe. But after a while, everything seems to click as they move smoothly around. The two grocery baskets are pushed against a shelf a bit farther away left and forgotten.</p><p>\u201cI think that the older you get, the easier it gets to stop caring about what people think about you. See for example, if I think dancing with you is important to let you realise for yourself how people grow and change, should I just ignore that opportunity; just because someone might discover us dancing on some old and probably dirty floor of a grocery store? Or should I reach out and touch?\u201d Phil whispers and Dan doesn\u2019t know what to say, his head is spinning, the smell of something fruity is filling his nostrils.</p><p>\u201cYou see, Dan, even if we are lost and confused, it doesn\u2019t mean we should refrain ourselves from daring to reaching out to catch opportunities.\u201d Dan sighs, if Phil really is right maybe he should let himself.</p><p>Dan rests his head in the crock of Phil\u2019s neck and pulls him closer and they dance, just letting the music fill their ears and pulsate through their bodies. \u201cI think you might be right\u201d Dan whispers against Phil\u2019s neck.</p><p>-</p><p>When they reach the cash register, Phil freezes, he grabs onto Dan\u2019s arm tightly, and Dan glances over at him. An irritated look fills Dan\u2019s features before he sees the discomfort so clearly visible on Phil\u2019s face, and his own features soften.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he mutters softly. Phil shakes his head \u201cbad memories\u2026\u201d he says his gaze distant. A frown grows on Dan\u2019s features. \u201cDo\u2026 do you want a hug?\u201d Dan asks. Phil\u2019s expression doesn\u2019t change, but he nods slowly.</p><p>Dan encloses him, like a blanket. Phil is swallowed by a scent that must just be purely Dan. He breathes in letting it swallow him and comfort. It works, it works amazingly well. Dan hugs him firmer and suddenly Phil knows exactly why that date felt off, why he can let himself so easily be engulfed in Dan\u2019s arms. He\u2019s got a crush on Dan, it all makes sense now.</p><p>-</p><p>They\u2019re laying on the sofa again, Phil has his head rested on the material of Dan\u2019s hoodie covering his chest. Dan hasn\u2019t asked Phil anything more about the incident at the store. Phil just couldn\u2019t talk to that cashier again, the minute he saw Charlie sitting there behind the cash register he could feel everything inside of him go cold and frosty like on a midwinter\u2019s day.</p><p>He\u2019d asked Dan to pay and folded up his woollen cap so that it covered the majority of his face. And Dan had done as he\u2019d asked without questioning Phil\u2019s weird behaviour. Man, Dan must think Phil\u2019s behaviour was ridiculous.</p><p>Dan absentmindedly plays with Phil\u2019s hair. It\u2019s cosy here, with Phil being so close. He seemed scared back then in the grocery store, and Dan didn\u2019t have the heart to tell him no when Phil rested his head against his chest at home. To be honest, being this close to Phil is helping him too, It\u2019s lessening the distress gnawing at him.</p><p>He closes his eyes letting his head rest against the couch. \u201cDan?\u201d Phil mumbles into the material of Dan\u2019s shirt. Dan yawns \u201cyeah?\u201d.</p><p>Phil snuggles closer arms winding around Dan\u2019s abdomen \u201cyou know when you told me you were going to publish your book\u201d Dan freezes and he swallows roughly.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d He lets his hands fall from Phil\u2019s hair now just resting on either side of him. \u201cI see you write in your notebook all the time, wouldn\u2019t it be easier if you just, I don\u2019t know, borrow my computer? I don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>Dan can feel a warmth blossoming in his stomach followed by Phil\u2019s words. \u201cPhil, you\u2019re the absolute best, do you know that?\u201d Phil smiles contented then laughs softly into the warmth of Dan\u2019s chest. \u201cYeah I\u2019m amazing aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>So what if only Phil gets the pun, it makes Dan laugh anyway.</p>",

Phil hums in acknowledgement, a frown painted on his pale face, he bites his lip turning it a rosy red colour. Dan&rsquo;s quite fascinated by it and can&rsquo;t make himself stop staring, he blames the early morning entirely for his weird behaviour. Hopefully, the coffee will wake him up clean.&nbsp;</p><p>&lsquo;Maybe you could sleep with me?&rsquo; Dan spits out the coffee into the mug&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>-</p><p>Beta: @phuzzyphan&#8203;</p><p>Summary:</p><p>A tale about a maverick writer whose audience doesn&rsquo;t yet breathe outside of his mind;<br />And a lost soul uploading stray youtube videos that don&rsquo;t seem to belong in this world.<br />On the other hand, since when does lost-souls meet under heavy rain, and what does belong if not strange circumstances when two misfits dare to reach out and touch.</p><p><b>Chapter 3</b></p><p>Dan closes his eyes, breathing in the heavy smell of carbs and cheese. He&rsquo;s so hungry that he could practically eat a plate right now. Dan takes off his glasses and wipes off the small water droplets that have gathered on the fogged-up glass.</p><p>Phil has already stepped up to the counter, wallet in his hands. On his lips a soft smile is present. As he opens the wallet something falls out of it. A single note flutters down to the floor. He kneels down and picks it up.</p><p>Against his cold hand, the note shines white, slightly corrugated from being inside of his wallet. There&rsquo;s a number written on it and under that something else is scribbled offhandedly. \"Hi birthday boy, I wasn&rsquo;t brave enough to ask you out face to face but if you want to go on a date with me don&rsquo;t hesitate to call&rdquo;.</p><p>Phil can&rsquo;t help but smile, he&rsquo;s never had someone give him their number, with haste he puts the note down the back pocket of his jeans for later. Never had he thought that the cashier would want to take him out, the thought that someone would at all, kind of both feels thrilling and terrifies him. Phil thinks that it would be nice to let himself try and go on a date with someone. Maybe he&rsquo;s a bit lonely sometimes, he admits reluctantly.</p><p>Martyn, Phil&rsquo;s brother, has always had his girlfriend and his mom and dad have always been together but Phil; He&rsquo;s always been alone, and for the longest of time he thought that it was supposed to be like that but now he has the chance to change that.</p><p>He smiles towards the man behind the desk, it&rsquo;s all because of the note. Something in his stomach is fluttering excitedly at the prospect of new opportunities. He orders his pizza and asks specifically for them to minimize the amount of cheese.</p><p>Dan leans over a table standing close to the desk, he&rsquo;s scribbling in his notebook again, something has caught his attention and he had to capture it. He looks up from the writing when Phil calls his name.</p><p>Phil is smiling, he stands leaning against the desk, one of his eyebrows raises in a smirk. The warm light from behind the desk reflects in his quiff. Dan blinks a couple of times shaking his head lightly &ldquo;what?&rdquo; He let&rsquo;s go of the pen in his grip, now perching his palm on the edge of the table.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you going to order?&rdquo; he says dragging out &lsquo;order&rsquo;, questioning Dan with that same expression. Dan laughs nervously scrabbling to get the notebook and pen into his bag already.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I could eat your left shoe right now, I&rsquo;m starving!&rdquo; Phil laughs and for a moment Dan spots the whites of his teeth and a warm feeling is spreading in his chest, Dan had almost forgotten how good, friendly company can feel.</p><p>&ldquo;Why the left one specifically?&rdquo; Phil asks, Dan smiles widely so that his dimples pop. &ldquo;Looks tasty to me&rdquo; Dan replies. Phil shakes his head laughing.</p><p>Maybe Dan&rsquo;s laughing more because he&rsquo;s relieved, relieved that his joke made Phil laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;You, sir, have got a very bad taste in shoes, they&rsquo;re like fifty-two years old&rdquo; Phil smiles tapping the tip of his shoe against the floor. The man behind the desk sighs and glances at his wristwatch.</p><p>&ldquo;Wow grandpa, I&rsquo;ve got great taste in shoes it&rsquo;s more about quality than quantity right? And those shoes look fresh to me&rdquo; Dan says as he walks over, his arms are crossed eyebrow raised teasingly. Phil&rsquo;s cheeks are dusted with a light pink blush, he laughs awkwardly, scratching his neck.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe so, but I&rsquo;d very much like to keep my left shoe&rdquo; Dan places both of his hands lightly on the desk leaning somewhat over it, looking into the eyes of the man on the other side of the counter.</p><p>The adrenaline kick from talking and how easy it had felt to just converse with Phil, has made him brave. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have the same as Phil,&rdquo; he says pointing at his friend standing just behind him. Phil places a hand on his shoulder a frown evident on his face &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m not so sure you&rsquo;ll li-&rdquo;</p><p>Dan shakes his head &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo;</p><p>-</p><p>As they wait on the pizza to be made they get comfortably seated in one of the booths. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe that it&rsquo;s raining so much, it&rsquo;s like the sky has never seen an happy ending. Always crying, now if I could just get up there and console it I would&rdquo; Phil whispers through rosy lips, that he&rsquo;s gnawed on.</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s looking out on the street they just were on, and he envisions the two of them standing there waving at him, he pictures Dan with a smile accompanying his own as imaginary Dan and Phil look back at him through the window of the pizzeria.</p><p>Maybe, he thinks, what he&rsquo;s just imagined is what the customers that sat inside of this cosy place saw. The made-up versions of them looked happy and most importantly, he himself didn&rsquo;t look lonely.</p><p>Phil looks back at Dan who&rsquo;s looking out of the window, just like Phil himself had done just a couple of minutes ago.</p><p>It&rsquo;s stranger to spend time with someone that isn&rsquo;t Louise than he thought it be and the thought is scary. How dependent on her has he become?</p><p>Phil looks around the place. Although he&rsquo;s living fairly near this pizza place, he&rsquo;s never thought of going here, he usually doesn&rsquo;t go towards the train station so maybe that&rsquo;s why;</p><p>But it&rsquo;s probably more because of there being a small Indian restaurant the other way from his home, that is much closer and their food is awesome for a lazy introvert like him to just take away.</p><p>Dan taps his fingers against the surface of the table impatiently. His fingers are itching, he&rsquo;s used to always touch things, press down keys enabled with letters. Even let them intake his dreams, the haunting clicking sound that follows when his fingers rhythmically press the keys down on the typewriter echoes in his ears.</p><p>He is starting to think that being with Phil for a few days won&rsquo;t be so bad. Maybe he needed a break from writing?</p><p>Maybe&hellip;</p><p>Phil rapidly turns his head awakening Dan from his thoughts, Phil&rsquo;s eyes light up at the sight of their steaming pizzas being placed before them. Just the look of them makes his mouth water. There&rsquo;s a hunger present in Phil&rsquo;s eyes he hasn&rsquo;t seen before, he thinks, for a moment, that his eyes probably resemble the same desire to devour this amazing-smelling meal.</p><p>-</p><p>Phil drops the cutlery on the greasy cardboard. He&rsquo;s cradling his stomach that looks soft and round. He both looks and sounds satisfied and his eyes look lidded. Dan eats the last piece of the crust, with a content hum he swallows audibly. He still feels energized, in fact, he feels like talking to Phil.</p><p>&ldquo;Phil?&rdquo; he asks tentatively as he tilts his head aslant. Phil nods leaning his head against his hand, chin digging into his palm. Phil&rsquo;s head seems so heavy already and it&rsquo;s not that late, seeing from a nocturnal idiot&rsquo;s point of view; Dan seriously has begun to realise how often he&rsquo;d spent the nights at his typewriter than in his bed, sleeping.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh-hm?&rdquo; Phil hums smiling softly as he&rsquo;s blinking tiredly at Dan on the other side of the table. Dan can&rsquo;t help but smile at the sight. &ldquo;You know when I said I write things?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil chuckles a little so that his resting head almost slips from his palm &ldquo;yeah&rdquo; he smiles then, eyes closed. &ldquo;I wrote a book and I&rsquo;m going to publish it,&rdquo; he says valiant, he&rsquo;s just going to have to re-write it. It can&rsquo;t be that hard, shouldn&rsquo;t be.</p><p>But the minute he utters those words he feels stupid and dumb. Why would Phil even care? But it&rsquo;s kind of nice telling someone about it, even if it&rsquo;s just half of the truth. It&rsquo;s Liberating, like letting go, falling freely, feeling the gut-wrenching tickles when you wait for an answer.</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s eyes shoot open wide &ldquo;you never told me you were going to publish, that is so exciting, congrats&rdquo; Phil smiles widely and Dan can&rsquo;t help but think that he looks good when he&rsquo;s tired, he&rsquo;s kind of jealous actually. He looks like a rat when he&rsquo;s tired. Plus he&rsquo;s got really unattractive undereye bags from the lack of sleep and no one in the whole world can deceive themselves into thinking they&rsquo;re an attractive feature.</p><p>Not to mention the messy curls he has to withstand when his hair even as much as senses humidity in the air. There&rsquo;s no meaning in straightening it anymore, this storm is particularly a death sentence, especially for his hair.</p><p>Now when Phil is smiling so much he can&rsquo;t tell him about what happened, not now. It will ruin the mood and Dan&rsquo;s not sure he&rsquo;s brave enough to tell Phil about it yet or if he even wants Phil&rsquo;s pity, what is Phil going to do about it? He can&rsquo;t help Dan.</p><p>The storm has trapped Dan here, brought the two of them together. Surely this must mean something? Dan was never that superstitious to begin with, but something within him almost hopes there&rsquo;s a reason it&rsquo;s Phil of all people he&rsquo;s trapped with.</p><p>-</p><p>Phil has suggested for them to watch yet another movie and Dan can&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s agreed to it. It&rsquo;s probably because Phil looked so happy talking about the movie, hell, he can&rsquo;t even remember what Phil told him it was about - all he remembers is that smile and the feeling that he wanted to be the reason it grew even wider.</p><p>And now Dan doesn&rsquo;t have the heart to tell Phil to move his leg away from his lap now that Phil looks so comfortable and honestly he doesn&rsquo;t really care anymore. He&rsquo;s feeling warm and cosy under the blanket. Dan&rsquo;s head slowly glides down the material of the cough until his head is rested on Phil&rsquo;s shoulder. Phil looks up from his phone, smiling, one eyebrow raised as if he&rsquo;s asking fondly &ldquo;what is it now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought you were the one who wanted to see a movie?&rdquo; Dan mumbles his eyes starting to close on their own accord.</p><p>Phil smiles, lowering his phone &ldquo;it was actually but I kinda got wrapped up texting with a person that I have a date with tomorrow and I&rsquo;m asking them when we&rsquo;re going to meet up.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan is suddenly wide awake, he clears his throat before asking &ldquo;a date?&rdquo; his voice sounds hollow and it surprises him more than Phil who doesn&rsquo;t seem to notice the change in tone in Dan&rsquo;s voice at all.</p><p>Of course, Phil has a date, For some dumb reason Dan thought that Phil was as lonely as him, it had seemed so almost and in some way that had calmed Dan down, made him relate better two the scrawny black-haired man with blue eyes. But now he felt almost jealous? Not because he fancies Phil or anything, just because this &ldquo;date&rdquo; is going to steal away his newfound friend and Dan is going to be lonely again.</p><p>Which, thinking about it, he should be happy about, really, since he&rsquo;s wanted alone time ever since meeting Phil. But strangely enough he realises that he doesn&rsquo;t want that now and he&rsquo;s actually been looking forward to spending some time with Phil; maybe even be able to forget about his book temporarily. He feels he really needs a break or he&rsquo;s going to have a breakdown.</p><p>-</p><p>Someone is poking his cheek. Dan groans and when he goes to turn away from the horrible pokes his back cracks and he scrunches up his face in pain.</p><p>He opens one eye to see Phil standing over him with a cup of coffee &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already made breakfast so&hellip; um if you want some you can join me in the kitchen, yeah?&rdquo; Dan nods slowly, accepting the warm cup from his friend&rsquo;s hands. &ldquo;Thanks&rdquo; he mumbles, voice husky so early in the morning. Phil just laughs &ldquo;no problem mate.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan sits up in the couch, taking a sip before he unsteadily rises and walks after Phil into the kitchen. &ldquo;Did you sleep badly?&rdquo; Phil asks him, he probably feels bad for letting Dan take the hard and very uncomfortable couch&hellip; again.</p><p>&ldquo;Um yeah&rdquo; Dan admits. Phil hums in acknowledgement, a frown painted on his pale face, he bites his lip turning it a rosy red colour. Dan&rsquo;s quite fascinated by it and can&rsquo;t make himself stop staring, he blames the early morning entirely for his weird behaviour. Hopefully, the coffee will wake him up clean.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe you could sleep with me?&rdquo; Dan spits out the coffee into the mug and Phil hurriedly continues whilst gesticulating wildly with his hands &ldquo;no, no not like that, my bed is pretty big and you could take one side, it&rsquo;d save your back from the ineluctable pain, if you were to take the couch again.&rdquo; When Dan still stares at Phil without uttering a word Phil promises in a shrill tone, uncomfortable for newly awakened ears.</p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t touch you or anything I swear! I just thought I&rsquo;d offer you something slightly more comfortable.&rdquo; Dan nods, his mess of a hair falls in front of his eyes whilst he takes another sip, before answering &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like that, the couch is killing me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Anything else you&rsquo;d like, your favourite food? I thought that we could go shop before the storm, like maybe tomorrow and store some food, you know, so we don&rsquo;t starve.&rdquo; Dan smiles a little, as much he can manage, being newly awake and all.</p><p>&ldquo;Pasta with loads of cheese on top, it&rsquo;s been so long since I&rsquo;ve made that myself at home.&rdquo; Phil wrinkles up his nose and Dan laughs a little &ldquo;what&rsquo;s wrong with some pasta?&rdquo; Dan smiles.</p><p>Phil shakes his head putting down his cup of coffee on the table &ldquo;not pasta, cheese&rdquo; Dan furrows his eyebrows &ldquo;you hate cheese?&rdquo; he says not managing to conceal the surprise laced in his voice.</p><p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s cheese on pizza, you ate cheese yesterday&rdquo; Phil pouts and lours at Dan &ldquo;Pizza is not the same though, it&rsquo;s the only exception, in any other situation cheese is utterly gross&rdquo; Dan shakes his head a fond smile settling on his features &ldquo;Phil Lester, you&rsquo;re an odd one&rdquo;.</p><p>-</p><p>The clocks one am when Phil stands before the door, the button up with a bunch of small hearts littered over it is mostly covered by the jacket he&rsquo;s swept on. Dan walks over to him, arms crossed over his chest protectively. It&rsquo;s cold in the apartment and Dan is freezing, he&rsquo;s thinking of stepping into the shower when Phil&rsquo;s out on a date.</p><p>They lock eyes and for what feels like an eternity they say nothing. Just two blue eyes watching a pair of brown. Dan relaxes, he should feel uncomfortable meeting Phil&rsquo;s gaze but he doesn&rsquo;t.</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s the first to break the eye contact, downcasting his eyes whilst muttering &ldquo;I should go or I&rsquo;ll be late.&rdquo; Dan nods inept, he parts his lips, he wants to say something but he doesn&rsquo;t know what. It feels like a storm is turning everything inside his stomach wrong. He doesn&rsquo;t recognise the feeling and it worries him. Maybe it&rsquo;s anxiety again, he thinks. Dan breathes in through his open mouth.</p><p>Phil nods a little as he turns around, he&rsquo;s holding a brightly coloured umbrella convulsively in his left hand as he pushes the door open. Dan swallows as Phil looks back one more time before the door clicks closed. &ldquo;Bye Phil&rdquo; Dan murmurs to the closed door.</p><p>-</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s eyes meet the dark sky with a smile. Through the sheer plastic material of the umbrella, Phil watches drop after drop fall and course it&rsquo;s ways downwards until finally, it hits the stone cold wet terrain joining the beyond of rainwater.</p><p>He has stood outside the restaurant for about ten minutes now, waiting for his date. The frown that had settled down on his features after leaving his home refused to move, and now he has forced a smile to grow in the dark. And contrary to popular belief, finding a source of light in your life is harder than you think. So the forced smile stays on his face as do the frown.</p><p>Someone knocks on his shoulder just as he&rsquo;s about to give up and go home. He turns around not actually expecting the cashiers face to meet his. He&rsquo;s smiling at Phil with eyes filled with vigour.</p><p>&ldquo;There you are, Phil was it? I almost didn&rsquo;t find you. My name&rsquo;s Charlie&rdquo; he says rapidly, Phil can&rsquo;t help but stare at the Charlie&rsquo;s mouth as it moves. Never has he seen anyone talk with such despatch.</p><p>Charlie shakes Phil&rsquo;s hands firmly and Phil is left a bit shell-shocked as Charlie waves for him to follow him inside. He shakes his head letting a small - but none the less - smile appear, a sprout that might grow till a full on flower, if Phil is lucky.</p><p>They walk up to a table and Charlie sits down looking up at Phil expectantly, &ldquo;so are we gonna order now? What do you like?&rdquo; he smiles placing both of his hands on the table leaning over it slightly, looking very excited. Phil reflexively leans back a little in his chair, clearing his throat.</p><p>&ldquo;Um&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know, I think I need to read the menu first&rdquo; Charlie laughs at that &ldquo;yeah, of course, sorry, my fault for being so stupid. I guess I&rsquo;m just excited to start this date with you and see what it could lead to.&rdquo; Charlie gesticulates wildly, maybe to hide the blush dusting his prominent cheeks.</p><p>Phil smiles &ldquo;I see, well, I&rsquo;m excited to&rdquo; he admits.</p><p>When the waiter arrives, they look through their menus, Phil is not surprised to know that Charlie has already picked a dish from the menu. And Phil silently wonders how many times Charlie&rsquo;s been here already. Phil shakes that thought out of his head, the feeling of not being special has settled in the bottom of his stomach.</p><p>He lets his eyes roam the page in search for anything he likes. He smiles a little when he sees the dish &ldquo;pasta bolognese - with extra cheese on top&rdquo;. He doesn&rsquo;t go for that though, another dish catches his attention - waffles.</p><p>About halfway through their meal, Charlie has brought up the fact that his work at the store is just the beginning on his soon to be awesome career. And with that attitude, Phil almost believes him. He really knows what he wants and in a way, Phil&rsquo;s really jealous.</p><p>But soon even Charlie runs out of things to tell Phil about himself. That&rsquo;s when the question suddenly lingers in the misty air inside the restaurant.</p><p>&ldquo;So what do you do for a living?&rdquo; Phil twists uncomfortably in the chair he almost hopes that Charlie notices how uncomfortable he feels about the sudden interrogation but his date doesn&rsquo;t even react.</p><p>He just can&rsquo;t say that he&rsquo;s a YouTuber. He&rsquo;s scared that he&rsquo;s going to be judged. For what, he doesn&rsquo;t know, maybe it&rsquo;s an irrational fear but Phil can&rsquo;t help but feel how it&rsquo;s weighing him down every time the particular question comes up.</p><p>He&rsquo;s always had a plan B prepared, one that often works for people that don&rsquo;t know him so well. &ldquo;you could say that I&rsquo;m a struggling actor&rdquo; he says shrugging. He hopes Charlie will just move on to another subject without any further questioning.</p><p>Maybe that was too much to ask for as Charlie&rsquo;s eyes light up with the mention of the word 'actor&rsquo;.</p><p>Charlie leans forward in his chair &ldquo;like a B-actor or&hellip;&rdquo; his eyes light up mischievously &ldquo;a porn actor?&rdquo; Phil&rsquo;s eyes widen considerably, mouth falling open in terror &ldquo;no!&rdquo; he yelps horrified. People around them give him weird looks and he can feel his cheeks redden.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh&rdquo; Charlie leans back then, straightening his back, he looks a bit disappointed.</p><p>-</p><p>When Dan finally finds the vacuum cleaner in a cupboard, he gives it a smile. The thought of getting into the shower was long gone - the minute he walked back into the living room and realised just how messy Phil&rsquo;s place is, so he thought he&rsquo;d do Phil a favour and clean for him whilst he&rsquo;s away.</p><p>So Dan starts in the living room, lifting up knick-knacks and carefully cleaning under them. He stops for a moment to look at some old photos sitting in frames on the surface of one of Phil&rsquo;s cabinets. One with what Dan assumes is Phil&rsquo;s mum and dad. They look kind and Dan can really see the resemblance between child and parents.</p><p>Phil look like the actual sun smiling back at the camera, his parents aren&rsquo;t that far off from that affinity either. In some way Dan can&rsquo;t help but be a little jealous, Dan has never had that opportunity to spend so much time with the whole of his family.</p><p>So, in one way, Phil and Dan are like the sun and moon. He wishes he was more like the sun, it seems that wherever &ldquo;he&rdquo; goes there are specks of leftover happiness to bask in. At least it feels so when Dan is around him.</p><p>The next photograph is one with Phil and another guy. Dan wonders who this might be and for a moment he queries if this is someone Phil used to date but something tells him he&rsquo;s wrong.<br />It&rsquo;s not just the fact that it&rsquo;d be weird for Phil to have an old photo with his ex just standing for whomever to see whenever; No it&rsquo;s the fact that they have the exact half smile and the bend of their nose is almost precisely identical. It must be Phil&rsquo;s brother, Phil must have a brother he hasn&rsquo;t told Dan about.</p><p>Dan flips over the photo to see if something is written on the backside of the frame. And there, with childlike handwriting, something is indeed written.</p><p>&ldquo;Me and my brother on his birthday 2014&rdquo; and underneath the text, with a slightly different handwriting something else is added, &ldquo;you can bet your life it was the most ace birthday ever lil&rsquo; bro.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan can&rsquo;t help but smile at it dumbly before he sets the frame back to where it stood previously. If he and his brother only had this type of relationship maybe everything had been different now.</p><p>Weirdly enough, cleaning the living room doesn&rsquo;t take as much time as he thought. He drags the vacuum cleaner towards the cupboard when something catches his attention, the door to Phil&rsquo;s bedroom stands ajar, from where he holds he can see a touch of a colourful wall-to-wall carpet.</p><p>The sun is foraging its way through the window spilling it&rsquo;s warm and golden glowing rays over the carpet and making their way to just about where he stands. It feels like an invite, a red carpet he should walk. Phil would probably appreciate if Dan cleaned his room. He kind of owes Phil after all he&rsquo;s done for him.</p><p>Dan pushes open the door with one hand, the other dragging the vacuum cleaner behind him. The first thing he sees is the big splotches of different colours this room has to offer, everything is so bright and cheerful; the second thing his brown eyes fix on is the camera standing in front of a big bed.</p><p>-</p><p>Phil exhales when the door closes behind him. He&rsquo;s so tired, that date really was something. Phil doesn&rsquo;t know what to make of it. He walks into the kitchen to find Dan sat on one of the stools hunched over the notebook he bought when they went into that little odd boutique with the old but cute lady who&rsquo;d insisted on reading Dan&rsquo;s palm.</p><p>Dan had smiled at her and Phil noticed how prominent Dan&rsquo;s dimples look when he smiles and Phil can&rsquo;t help but think that it is adorable. Dan had agreed even though he looked very uncomfortable as the lady studied his hand.</p><p>He watched her with brown, kind eyes. There was a warmth in them - Phil hadn&rsquo;t realised until now - that always appeared like a glowing fire when Dan was interested in something.</p><p>She&rsquo;d told them that Dan had endured many adventures but that he&rsquo;d left something important behind, something that needed him before time had its chance to run out. She was very grave with how important it was as she tapped the glass of the hourglass standing on the desk. Dan seemed to ebb at her words, his shoulder hunching up in defence, eyes carrying a worried tone to them as he bit his rosy lip. His curly hair laid flat and messy.</p><p>But she didn&rsquo;t stop there, she told him that there is always a rainbow after the rain, no matter how heavy the weather is.</p><p>Seeing Dan sat in his kitchen now makes him wonder if Dan is solving his own problems by himself. If the contact with paper, the constant clinging to words helps Dan relax and heal wounds Phil doesn&rsquo;t even know about, those who are invisible to the eye.</p><p>&ldquo;Missed me?&rdquo; Phil asks. Dan looks up, but there&rsquo;s no smile meeting Phil&rsquo;s. &ldquo;How&rsquo;d the date go?&rdquo; Dan asks but there&rsquo;s no interest in his voice, and Phil has a feeling Dan&rsquo;s not even trying to mask it.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, I guess&rdquo; horribly, the date went horribly. But he can&rsquo;t say that, it be too mean, if he knew Dan better maybe he&rsquo;d be able to tell him but he doesn&rsquo;t have the heart when the guy seems so down at the moment.</p><p>Phil realises that he judges people a lot and he knows that but he can&rsquo;t help it, it something that comes as natural as blinking to him. Most of the time he feels bad for thinking these judgemental thoughts but at least he never say them to anyone.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, good&rdquo; Dan mumbles it sounds like he doesn&rsquo;t really listen but Phil knows he does, the slow movement of pen against paper has stopped but Dan&rsquo;s eyes are still stubbornly glued to the block before him. His eyebrows lower and it looks like he grits his teeth.</p><p>&ldquo;Would you like going and shopping together before the big storm arrives and all the supermarkets close?&rdquo; Dan nods and Phil thinks he can just about make out the glimpse of a smile.</p><p>-</p><p>It&rsquo;s dark out when they arrive. The sky has enveloped them in a hue of blue and there&rsquo;s no trace of any stars, they&rsquo;re all hidden from view by the fat drops of rain still relentlessly smattering down from the heavens above. Dan wonders if it soon is going to feel like the days overlap each other in this never-ending hair ruining weather.</p><p>He shakes his head in vain, the curly, dripping locks of his hair falling back in front of his dark eyes. Phil nods for them to go inside. Dan pushes open the door to the grocery store holding up the door so Phil can walk inside. Phil is folding the small umbrella that scarcely covered the both of them, judging by the state of his own hair. They grab a grocery basket each and move inwards.</p><p>Dan has been feeling off ever since yesterday and it seems like there isn&rsquo;t only a storm on the abroad but one within him as well and it won&rsquo;t calm down. It&rsquo;s getting worse the more he thinks about it.</p><p>First Phil goes on a date and leaves Dan all alone, which should be fine in all honesty. But something still feels wrong and he doesn&rsquo;t know why. He doesn&rsquo;t understand why he&rsquo;s so upset over the fact that Phil went on a date and left him alone, really it&rsquo;s stupid.</p><p>Then later Dan finds that camera, he doesn&rsquo;t know what to make of it. He&rsquo;s confused and it feels like Phil has lied to him though no words have been uttered.</p><p>Dan doesn&rsquo;t want to know what Phil does with the camera, his mind went to the worst possible place in an instant. Breath hitching in his throat and heart beating against his ribcage like he&rsquo;d violated Phil&rsquo;s privacy. He only wanted to help Phil clean.</p><p>He wants to tell himself that the anger towards Phil as well as the shame he himself feel is irrational but&hellip; but why else would he have a camera facing his bed.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not only that Dan is worried about Phil did invite Dan to his bed promising it would be platonic bedsharing what is Dan going to make of it? Is he going to be able to trust that Phil is telling the truth when he hasn&rsquo;t even bothered to mention why he has a camera angled towards his bed?</p><p>Dan has sent his own mind into a spiral of dark thoughts, he can&rsquo;t help but feel like he&rsquo;s almost drowning. Torn by the two sides of either trusting Phil or not.</p><p>Surely no one as adorable as Phil would work with something like that. Or does it even matter how adorable he is? Do looks decipher something like that?</p><p>Should he ask Phil? But if he does, then Phil will know he&rsquo;s been inside of his room. A voice inside of his head argues that if Phil worked with doing porn would it really matter? Would that suddenly make him unreliable? No&hellip;</p><p>But Dan would&rsquo;ve liked if Phil told him first - but at the same time, Dan doesn&rsquo;t have anything to do with that&hellip; or does he? Considering that he&rsquo;s going to sleep in that bed.</p><p>Dan sighs, looking down at their shopping list. Phil looks over at him, and for a moment Dan realises how long Phil&rsquo;s eyelashes really are even though you for the most of the time can&rsquo;t decipher that from afar because they&rsquo;re a light brown. His blue eyes watch Dan silently.</p><p>Strangely enough, he realises he still likes Phil even though this dirty secret has drifted to the surface. He still wants Phil to like him. He wants to prove that he can be a good friend. Someone who doesn&rsquo;t judge Phil for&hellip; for that. He&rsquo;s going to sleep in that bed even though strange things might&rsquo;ve happened there.</p><p>&ldquo;You tired?&rdquo; he asks and Dan has to smile a little, he nods but there&rsquo;s a lump in his throat thinking about going to bed&hellip; to bed with Phil. Nothing is going to happen, why does he think differently of Phil because of that single piece of technology?</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;&rdquo; he drawls. They walk over the polished floors, the rows of products standing on their shelves float by in their field of view and comes across as unimportant in their tired minds. They stop when they find a product they&rsquo;ve written down on the list.</p><p>It&rsquo;s weirdly empty in the store, though it&rsquo;s quite late so that might be why. Phil hums a little to the song playing in the background and sways his hips in a barely noticeable way.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you ever just stop caring about people judging you?&rdquo; Phil whispers and challenges Dan with blue eyes filled with something new Dan&rsquo;s never seen.</p><p>Dan smiles sadly, turning his back towards Phil. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, Phil&rdquo; Phil hums at that and it&rsquo;s silent for a while. Dan has time to think that Phil is taking his time contemplating Dan&rsquo;s answer.</p><p>But when Phil places a hand on his shoulder, and Dan turns around seeing Phil with his other hand held out in the air like an invite, Dan raises an eyebrow.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s time to change that - dance with me?&rdquo; Dan wants to laugh it off and roll his eyes, saying something in the style of &ldquo;why would I ever do that, dancing with you- that&rsquo;s ridiculous, Phil, you&rsquo;re ridiculous!</p><p>But&hellip; but he just can&rsquo;t. Phil has the kindest smile painted upon his pink lips. His eyes are so blue they resemble the skies on a summer day when the smallest breeze is a relief for your burnt skin.</p><p>Dan hums then taking Phil&rsquo;s hand in his \"show me then, how you stop caring so much, huh&rdquo; Dan&rsquo;s voice is soft when he answers.</p><p>Phil places a hand around dan&rsquo;s back pulling him in closer and if Dan hadn&rsquo;t truly realised how hard it is standing so close to the sun without risking getting burnt, now he did. Dan looks up through the curly fringe, meeting Phil&rsquo;s eyes. Phil squeezes Dan&rsquo;s warm hand in his as they slowly move around on the floor of the grocery store. The music in the background is clearer now that they aren&rsquo;t so absorbed in their discussion.</p><p>It&rsquo;s awkward at first as they stumble unsure of themselves. Phil doesn&rsquo;t say anything when Dan clumsily steps on his toe. But after a while, everything seems to click as they move smoothly around. The two grocery baskets are pushed against a shelf a bit farther away left and forgotten.</p><p>&ldquo;I think that the older you get, the easier it gets to stop caring about what people think about you. See for example, if I think dancing with you is important to let you realise for yourself how people grow and change, should I just ignore that opportunity; just because someone might discover us dancing on some old and probably dirty floor of a grocery store? Or should I reach out and touch?&rdquo; Phil whispers and Dan doesn&rsquo;t know what to say, his head is spinning, the smell of something fruity is filling his nostrils.</p><p>&ldquo;You see, Dan, even if we are lost and confused, it doesn&rsquo;t mean we should refrain ourselves from daring to reaching out to catch opportunities.&rdquo; Dan sighs, if Phil really is right maybe he should let himself.</p><p>Dan rests his head in the crock of Phil&rsquo;s neck and pulls him closer and they dance, just letting the music fill their ears and pulsate through their bodies. &ldquo;I think you might be right&rdquo; Dan whispers against Phil&rsquo;s neck.</p><p>-</p><p>When they reach the cash register, Phil freezes, he grabs onto Dan&rsquo;s arm tightly, and Dan glances over at him. An irritated look fills Dan&rsquo;s features before he sees the discomfort so clearly visible on Phil&rsquo;s face, and his own features soften.</p><p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he mutters softly. Phil shakes his head &ldquo;bad memories&hellip;&rdquo; he says his gaze distant. A frown grows on Dan&rsquo;s features. &ldquo;Do&hellip; do you want a hug?&rdquo; Dan asks. Phil&rsquo;s expression doesn&rsquo;t change, but he nods slowly.</p><p>Dan encloses him, like a blanket. Phil is swallowed by a scent that must just be purely Dan. He breathes in letting it swallow him and comfort. It works, it works amazingly well. Dan hugs him firmer and suddenly Phil knows exactly why that date felt off, why he can let himself so easily be engulfed in Dan&rsquo;s arms. He&rsquo;s got a crush on Dan, it all makes sense now.</p><p>-</p><p>They&rsquo;re laying on the sofa again, Phil has his head rested on the material of Dan&rsquo;s hoodie covering his chest. Dan hasn&rsquo;t asked Phil anything more about the incident at the store. Phil just couldn&rsquo;t talk to that cashier again, the minute he saw Charlie sitting there behind the cash register he could feel everything inside of him go cold and frosty like on a midwinter&rsquo;s day.</p><p>He&rsquo;d asked Dan to pay and folded up his woollen cap so that it covered the majority of his face. And Dan had done as he&rsquo;d asked without questioning Phil&rsquo;s weird behaviour. Man, Dan must think Phil&rsquo;s behaviour was ridiculous.</p><p>Dan absentmindedly plays with Phil&rsquo;s hair. It&rsquo;s cosy here, with Phil being so close. He seemed scared back then in the grocery store, and Dan didn&rsquo;t have the heart to tell him no when Phil rested his head against his chest at home. To be honest, being this close to Phil is helping him too, It&rsquo;s lessening the distress gnawing at him.</p><p>He closes his eyes letting his head rest against the couch. &ldquo;Dan?&rdquo; Phil mumbles into the material of Dan&rsquo;s shirt. Dan yawns &ldquo;yeah?&rdquo;.</p><p>Phil snuggles closer arms winding around Dan&rsquo;s abdomen &ldquo;you know when you told me you were going to publish your book&rdquo; Dan freezes and he swallows roughly.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; He lets his hands fall from Phil&rsquo;s hair now just resting on either side of him. &ldquo;I see you write in your notebook all the time, wouldn&rsquo;t it be easier if you just, I don&rsquo;t know, borrow my computer? I don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan can feel a warmth blossoming in his stomach followed by Phil&rsquo;s words. &ldquo;Phil, you&rsquo;re the absolute best, do you know that?&rdquo; Phil smiles contented then laughs softly into the warmth of Dan&rsquo;s chest. &ldquo;Yeah I&rsquo;m amazing aren&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p><p>So what if only Phil gets the pun, it makes Dan laugh anyway.</p>",

Phil hums in acknowledgement, a frown painted on his pale face, he bites his lip turning it a rosy red colour. Dan&rsquo;s quite fascinated by it and can&rsquo;t make himself stop staring, he blames the early morning entirely for his weird behaviour. Hopefully, the coffee will wake him up clean.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&lsquo;Maybe you could sleep with me?&rsquo; Dan spits out the coffee into the mug&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>-</p>\n</p>",

Ten times? Twenty? Might be even more than that. It\u2019s the single most amazing phanfic I have ever read in my life. It\u2019s also so on point with both Dan and Phil\u2019s characteristics that I\u2019m still certain Monika hacked into Phil\u2019s old files and simply posted them as a fic. If you haven\u2019t read it yet, please do. It\u2019s brilliant, it\u2019s art, hands down.<br/>\n\nMonika, wiesz, jak bardzo kocham twoje historie, a szczegolnie ta. Dziekuje za opublikowanie tej i kazdej innej. Jestes niesamowita, mam nadzieje, ze to wiesz.\n\n<br/></p><p>2.

It\u2019s cute and adorable and both Dan and Phil are portrayed in a way that\u2019s quite special, but it works so so well! (I also love the fact that they\u2019re both just incapable of yoga. It\u2019s very on point :D)\u00a0</p><p>3. domestic chores<br/><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/chapters/28376272\">when i sing, you sing harmonies</a> (46k) by <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcrI4U8qO9vxrnxfSYBY6hQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcrI4U8qO9vxrnxfSYBY6hQ\">@leblonde</a><br/>Another fic I would consider a classic, at least for me. It\u2019s amazingly well written in a mysterious kind of way, and I love how the magic shows itself on the grand scheme, but also in the little things like the kitchenware working on its own. It changed the way I saw things, it changed the way i saw myself, and that means a lot. Simply an amazing work.<br/></p><p>\u00a0<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/16408844\">Hope for the Good Times</a> (1,1k) by <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mufvz9WVyRT0StTpRn5wTWw\">@succubusphan</a> <br/>It\u2019s just a short fic, but it\u2019s so cute and nice and the idea behind is is just brilliant. It means a lot to me, and it\u2019s adorable and it has a cat named Satan. What more does a story need?<br/></p><p>4. Makeup<br/><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/15227202/chapters/35317623\">The Era of the Wingless Angel</a> (~140k so far) by <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mx7Lh03GPKuVF6MTQGyUkJA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mx7Lh03GPKuVF6MTQGyUkJA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mx7Lh03GPKuVF6MTQGyUkJA\">@americanphancakes</a><br/>Sadly I fail to keep up with this story, but it is seriously breathtaking. Admittedly, it\u2019s not an easy read, mostly because it\u2019s angsty af, but it\u2019s more than worth it. The storyline is unique and <i>different</i>, in the best way, and Zero\u2019s style is so, so great. You won\u2019t regret reading it, I promise. <br/></p><p>5. Vampire/Werewolf AU<br/><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/4874644/chapters/11175523\">The Enemy of My Enemy Is Not My Friend and My Enemy Is Actually My Secret Lover</a> (110k) by \n\n<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/users/darkness_prince_dan/pseuds/darkness_prince_dan\">darkness_prince_dan</a>\n\n<br/>I\u2019m a sucker for Vampire/Werewolf AUs, but this one takes the cake. It\u2019s written in a&hellip; light way, so to speak, even though some scenes should be pretty dark. Dan is just&hellip; special in this, and I love it a lot. It\u2019s definitely worth a read if you have some time on your hands.\u00a0</p><p>6. family issues<br/><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/14236554/chapters/32826111\">Believe in Me</a> (85k) by <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-TJxWY0PRj_xDCTvJ9ia8Q\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-TJxWY0PRj_xDCTvJ9ia8Q\">@elleberquist6</a><br/>The concept for this story is just amazing. It follows the old japanese folklore of Kitsunes, and that alone is enough reason to love it, even beside the fact that it\u2019s really nicely executed. Phil is the amazing, compassionate guy we all know and love and Dan is just - different. It takes some time to figure out what\u2019s going on, but it\u2019s really nice learning more and more about Dan and what he is as the story progresses. Amazing work!</p><p>7. cheating <br/><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/15529335/chapters/36048678\">antisocialites watch a wilting flower</a> (70k) by <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mE_HCqZHn5Ecefhw2G88UVQ\">@det395</a><br/>Just an amazing story.

Ten times? Twenty? Might be even more than that. It&rsquo;s the single most amazing phanfic I have ever read in my life. It&rsquo;s also so on point with both Dan and Phil&rsquo;s characteristics that I&rsquo;m still certain Monika hacked into Phil&rsquo;s old files and simply posted them as a fic. If you haven&rsquo;t read it yet, please do. It&rsquo;s brilliant, it&rsquo;s art, hands down.<br />\n\nMonika, wiesz, jak bardzo kocham twoje historie, a szczegolnie ta. Dziekuje za opublikowanie tej i kazdej innej. Jestes niesamowita, mam nadzieje, ze to wiesz.\n\n<br /></p><p>2.

It&rsquo;s cute and adorable and both Dan and Phil are portrayed in a way that&rsquo;s quite special, but it works so so well! (I also love the fact that they&rsquo;re both just incapable of yoga. It&rsquo;s very on point :D)&nbsp;</p><p>3. domestic chores<br /><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/chapters/28376272\">when i sing, you sing harmonies</a> (46k) by <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcrI4U8qO9vxrnxfSYBY6hQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcrI4U8qO9vxrnxfSYBY6hQ\">@leblonde</a><br />Another fic I would consider a classic, at least for me. It&rsquo;s amazingly well written in a mysterious kind of way, and I love how the magic shows itself on the grand scheme, but also in the little things like the kitchenware working on its own. It changed the way I saw things, it changed the way i saw myself, and that means a lot. Simply an amazing work.<br /></p><p>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/16408844\">Hope for the Good Times</a> (1,1k) by <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mufvz9WVyRT0StTpRn5wTWw\">@succubusphan</a> <br />It&rsquo;s just a short fic, but it&rsquo;s so cute and nice and the idea behind is is just brilliant. It means a lot to me, and it&rsquo;s adorable and it has a cat named Satan. What more does a story need?<br /></p><p>4.

Admittedly, it&rsquo;s not an easy read, mostly because it&rsquo;s angsty af, but it&rsquo;s more than worth it. The storyline is unique and <i>different</i>, in the best way, and Zero&rsquo;s style is so, so great. You won&rsquo;t regret reading it, I promise. <br /></p><p>5.

It&rsquo;s written in a&hellip; light way, so to speak, even though some scenes should be pretty dark. Dan is just&hellip; special in this, and I love it a lot. It&rsquo;s definitely worth a read if you have some time on your hands.&nbsp;</p><p>6. family issues<br /><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/14236554/chapters/32826111\">Believe in Me</a> (85k) by <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-TJxWY0PRj_xDCTvJ9ia8Q\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-TJxWY0PRj_xDCTvJ9ia8Q\">@elleberquist6</a><br />The concept for this story is just amazing. It follows the old japanese folklore of Kitsunes, and that alone is enough reason to love it, even beside the fact that it&rsquo;s really nicely executed. Phil is the amazing, compassionate guy we all know and love and Dan is just - different. It takes some time to figure out what&rsquo;s going on, but it&rsquo;s really nice learning more and more about Dan and what he is as the story progresses. Amazing work!</p><p>7. cheating <br /><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/15529335/chapters/36048678\">antisocialites watch a wilting flower</a> (70k) by <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mE_HCqZHn5Ecefhw2G88UVQ\">@det395</a><br />Just an amazing story. It&rsquo;s honest and serious and sometimes, almost hopeless, but there&rsquo;s also cheerful moments and the most adorable scenes between Dan and Phil. There&rsquo;s a lot of dogs which, let&rsquo;s be honest, is always a plus, and Phil battles them all over the cuteness crown. Dan has a lot of issues, sure, but he&rsquo;s working through them, and does an amazing job while doing it; and the concept along with the general style is just amazing. <br /></p><p>8. wedding (not theirs)<br /><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/12609752/chapters/28724912\">The Bahamas Incident</a> (70k) by <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjaFk07OtUOQtRttLmKmNVg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjaFk07OtUOQtRttLmKmNVg\">@do-it-with-the-howell-lesters</a><br />Usually, fics with homophobic slurs are not exactly my piece of cake, but I still like this story a lot.
