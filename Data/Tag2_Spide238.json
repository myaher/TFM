He tired his hardest to not stare at her while she walked through the halls, he tried to leave class slightly late so he could walk behind her, and he tried his very hardest to not be near her when she was alone. He knew, if he ever talked to her again, it would only be a fight.

But no, his response being that she would have been better off without knowing, a scoff from her as a response, then a slap. </p><p>He never knew how undeniably in love he was with (Y/N) until after that night. He couldn\u2019t get her off of his mind, couldn\u2019t stop yearning to talk to her again. He lazily stared at the chemistry homework on the library table, eyeing the numbers and letters with intense hatred. He groaned aloud, letting his hand go, which supported his head, and hit his forehead on the table. Hissing, he moved up slightly and rubbed the front of his face, eyes squinting. He then noticed (Y/N), standing a few bookcases down, watching him. She had on the University\u2019s purple emblem sweater with a grey skirt that fanned just below her mid-thigh, and her hair was pinned in a loose low bun. Peter felt his heart constrict, and when she saw him looking back, she turned her head as though she was never looking. </p><p>He couldn\u2019t take it anymore. He had to say something to her. It had been far too long. Peter rose from the table and set his pencil down next to the papers. He cleared his throat and moved down the path and towards (Y/N) next to the bookcase. He shuffled up to her, and coughed awkwardly, looking at her beautiful face. She stayed silent, ignoring him. </p><p>Peter sighed and rubbed a hand over his face. \u201c(Y/N), please, talk to me.\u201d Still he had no response from her as she scanned the book bindings. \u201c(Y/N), this isn\u2019t working. Please, can we stop this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretending I can\u2019t hear you, has actually worked surprisingly well so far,\u201d she stated pitilessly without looking at him, pulling a book from the bookcase out, right in front of his face. He jerked back, a frown forming on his lips. </p><p>\u201c(Y/N) c\u2019mon,\u201d he preened, walked after her. He didn\u2019t care about his homework at this point. </p><p>\u201cPeter, just go\u2026make a web or something. I don\u2019t care.\u201d </p><p>Peter groaned and stopped in front of the desk in which she slid into. She sighed and pulled her black thinly rimmed glasses out of her purse and pressed them to her face, opening the book and taking out her notepad. Peter slid into the chair across from her, staring. </p><p>\u201c(Y/N), I\u2019m\u00a0<i>sorry</i>.\u201d He said, his eyes pleading to her. \u201cPlease, can we maybe, I don\u2019t know, get food tonight, and talk about it?\u201d</p><p>She paused for a moment, then looked up, her eyes wavering. \u201cI have a date. With Jonas Mathers, at King Garden tonight.\u201d</p><p>Peter almost choked. <i>Jonas Mathers?\u00a0</i>Of course, she would be going out with the star baseball player, of <i>course</i>she would have a date. He wanted to throw himself into the nearest trash can and hide in there for the rest of his life. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026nice,\u201d he coughed out, looking down from the window beside them. She looked at him, a frown gracing her lips. She sighed and looked down at the book, not pushing anymore conversation. </p><p>\u201cWell, uh,\u201d he said awkwardly, pushing himself out of the chair and looking to the ground. \u201cHave fun with that.\u201d </p><p>She nodded, obviously not reading the book, but not looking at Peter at all. He closed his eyes and turned around, walking back to his desk like a fool. <i>\u2018Turn around, and tell her how you feel!\u2019 </i>His brain screamed at him. Yet, no change occurred in his steps, and soon he found himself walking out of the library, backpack in tow, towards the subway. </p><p>Later that evening, Peter sat in the living room of his shared apartment with Ned, who was currently out of town and in visits with his family. Peter clicked through his pictures on his laptop, the daily evening news playing in front of him on the television. He looked at the faces; him, Ned, and (Y/N) smiling and laughing. He remembered the day he took these pictures in Central Park. The sun was full and bright, and the air wasn\u2019t humid or wet. There was a cool summer breeze, and the fountain looked extra sparkling. (Y/N) stepped around the top of the fountain like a ballerina, her yellow and pink dress bright in the sun. Peter sighed and shut the laptop, laying his head back against the cough and closing his eyes. </p><p>\u201cWe have breaking news here, just coming in from our onsite reporter,\u201d the television spoke. \u201cThere is an armed robbery taking place on Adams and 15<sup>th\u00a0</sup>street, currently two fatalities and police are at a standstill. There are hostages inside.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes flew open and he stood in the living room. On the television, images of the robbery were in place, and Peter knew just were that was. <i>King Garden</i>. There was a bank just down the block, and Peter believed it logical that whoever perpetrated the attack, would have ran down the street, probably cornered by police, and went into the restaurant. He jumped around the couch, ran into is room, pulled out his suit and slipped it on, opening his window and slinging out, flying down the streets in hopes he could make it in time. </p><p>When Peter finally came across the restaurant, he had been right. The place was swarmed by cops, and gun fire admitted every so often. He narrowed his eyes, looking down and numbering how may forces were on the ground, then decided his best bet was flying to the side of the building to not attract unwanted attention, and come in through the kitchen. He knew the backdoor was probably locked, but he could find a way in. He lifted his hand and flung himself on the web over the buildings and around the corners. He slid onto the ground, grabbing onto the side restaurant door and snapping the handle off, kicking the door forward and walked into the kitchen. There were no people in the room. <i>Probably all held in the front</i>, he affirmed, walking down the empty kitchen and towards the entrance of the dining room. He looked out the window on the kitchen door, scanning the group of customers, and the robber who sat behind the hostess desk. Then, on the side of the room, Peter noticed the familiar form and face of (Y/N), huddled underneath a table and holding her legs to her chest. Jonas sat opposite of her, pressed against the wall. She looked around nervously, then, her eyes fell to the kitchen door and they widened. Peter shook his head, raising a finger to his lips. She nodded slightly, making no noise. </p><p>He took a breath, pulled his fist back, and slammed it into the window, a crash emitting from the door. The robber turned their head, shouting. Shot fired from the police cars, and the customers screamed, pulling their hands over their head. Peter retracted his hand and pulled his fingers in, zipping a web out and pulling the weapon from the robber\u2019s hands and slamming it against the door, crashing in minuscule pieces. He kicked open the door, and shot more webs towards the robber, yelling at the customers to get out through the back door. They all ran behind him, and Peter tied the robber to the desk with ease. He punched the criminal down, and stuck his webs to the desk, clipping the robber\u2019s hands together and tying them down. The police outside grabbed the customers, calming them down and calling dispatch on the updates. Peter walked away from the robber and ran out the back door, leaving the Police to collect the felon. </p><p>He swung himself down the streets, the wind breezing through his suit. Making his way to the apartment, he slid himself through the open window and hit against his bed. He pulled the top of the suit off, running and hand through his hair. He walked into the bathroom, running water over his face and taking a deep breath before drying and walking into the living room area. He walked over to the kitchen, pulling out a soda and popping the top off, gulping the sugary drink down in a hurry. His heart was racing, still not used to the feeling of seeing (Y/N) in the restaurant. People being interviewed on the television, spouting praises of him, or better his alter-ego, but he ignored them and closed his eyes, shivering slightly at the sound of the doorbell. His eyes widened and he struggled pulling off the suit and throwing it into his room, pulling on his old high school spirit shirt and a pair of gray sweats. He ran to the door and opened it wide, staring blankly at (Y/N) who stood in the middle of the frame. </p><p>\u201c(Y/N), what are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>She pushed forward, wrapping her arms around his neck and pressing her lips to his. His heart stopped, and he wrapped his arms around her waist securely. He felt small tears drip onto his cheeks from her eyes as she squinted them shut, and he rubbed her back softly. She pulled her face back and tucked it into the crook of his neck, hiccupping and wetting his shirt. He closed his eyes and sighed, holding her close. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m <i>so, so sorry</i>, Peter,\u201d she cried quietly on his shoulder. He frowned and held her tighter. </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to apologize,\u201d he whispered, pushing his face into the side of her head, smelling her sweet shampoo and smiling to himself. \u201cI\u2019ll always be there to protect you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that,\u201d she whispered, pulling away. She looked into his eyes with tears pooling on the rims. \u201cTonight, I thought I was gonna die, and I realized how much I would <i>miss\u00a0</i>you, how much it hurt me to not talk to you, to not forgive you. I shouldn\u2019t have gotten mad, I shouldn\u2019t\u2014.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes, you should have, (Y/N),\u201d he interrupted. \u201cI should have told you. I was being stupid, and I thought I had a better chance at protecting you if you didn\u2019t know. But, I was wrong. I should have talked to you about it.\u201d </p><p>He pressed his hands to her cheeks and kissed her forehead. \u201cI can\u2019t lose you, too,\u201d he whispered softly. Tears fell down her face and she pulled him to herself again, sighing and kissing his jaw softly. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never lose me.\u201d</p>",

He tired his hardest to not stare at her while she walked through the halls, he tried to leave class slightly late so he could walk behind her, and he tried his very hardest to not be near her when she was alone. He knew, if he ever talked to her again, it would only be a fight. Whenever he saw her, the memories of the night he accidently <i>almost</i>got her killed, and then proceeded to unmask himself to her, only resulting in a slap in the face, he knew their relationship would never be the same.</p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019d think the person you\u2019re <b>best friends\u00a0</b>with, would have the balls to at least tell their friend something!\u201d </i>She had yelled at him in the middle of that New York alley behind the Chinese takeout restaurant she loved. <i>\u201cYou\u2019d think that I would\u2019ve meant something, anything! I could\u2019ve been killed tonight, and then this?\u201d</i></p><p>Peter tried to explain to her, tried in his best manner to help her understand why he thought not telling her was the best idea. <i>\u2018Because I\u2019m in love with you!\u2019 </i>his brain yelled at him. But no, his response being that she would have been better off without knowing, a scoff from her as a response, then a slap. </p><p>He never knew how undeniably in love he was with (Y/N) until after that night. He couldn\u2019t get her off of his mind, couldn\u2019t stop yearning to talk to her again. He lazily stared at the chemistry homework on the library table, eyeing the numbers and letters with intense hatred. He groaned aloud, letting his hand go, which supported his head, and hit his forehead on the table. Hissing, he moved up slightly and rubbed the front of his face, eyes squinting. He then noticed (Y/N), standing a few bookcases down, watching him. She had on the University\u2019s purple emblem sweater with a grey skirt that fanned just below her mid-thigh, and her hair was pinned in a loose low bun. Peter felt his heart constrict, and when she saw him looking back, she turned her head as though she was never looking. </p><p>He couldn\u2019t take it anymore. He had to say something to her. It had been far too long. Peter rose from the table and set his pencil down next to the papers. He cleared his throat and moved down the path and towards (Y/N) next to the bookcase. He shuffled up to her, and coughed awkwardly, looking at her beautiful face. She stayed silent, ignoring him. </p><p>Peter sighed and rubbed a hand over his face. \u201c(Y/N), please, talk to me.\u201d Still he had no response from her as she scanned the book bindings. \u201c(Y/N), this isn\u2019t working. Please, can we stop this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretending I can\u2019t hear you, has actually worked surprisingly well so far,\u201d she stated pitilessly without looking at him, pulling a book from the bookcase out, right in front of his face. He jerked back, a frown forming on his lips. </p><p>\u201c(Y/N) c\u2019mon,\u201d he preened, walked after her. He didn\u2019t care about his homework at this point. </p><p>\u201cPeter, just go\u2026make a web or something. I don\u2019t care.\u201d </p><p>Peter groaned and stopped in front of the desk in which she slid into. She sighed and pulled her black thinly rimmed glasses out of her purse and pressed them to her face, opening the book and taking out her notepad. Peter slid into the chair across from her, staring. </p><p>\u201c(Y/N), I\u2019m\u00a0<i>sorry</i>.\u201d He said, his eyes pleading to her. \u201cPlease, can we maybe, I don\u2019t know, get food tonight, and talk about it?\u201d</p><p>She paused for a moment, then looked up, her eyes wavering. \u201cI have a date. With Jonas Mathers, at King Garden tonight.\u201d</p><p>Peter almost choked. <i>Jonas Mathers?\u00a0</i>Of course, she would be going out with the star baseball player, of <i>course</i>she would have a date. He wanted to throw himself into the nearest trash can and hide in there for the rest of his life. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026nice,\u201d he coughed out, looking down from the window beside them. She looked at him, a frown gracing her lips. She sighed and looked down at the book, not pushing anymore conversation. </p><p>\u201cWell, uh,\u201d he said awkwardly, pushing himself out of the chair and looking to the ground. \u201cHave fun with that.\u201d </p><p>She nodded, obviously not reading the book, but not looking at Peter at all. He closed his eyes and turned around, walking back to his desk like a fool. <i>\u2018Turn around, and tell her how you feel!\u2019 </i>His brain screamed at him. Yet, no change occurred in his steps, and soon he found himself walking out of the library, backpack in tow, towards the subway. </p><p>Later that evening, Peter sat in the living room of his shared apartment with Ned, who was currently out of town and in visits with his family. Peter clicked through his pictures on his laptop, the daily evening news playing in front of him on the television. He looked at the faces; him, Ned, and (Y/N) smiling and laughing. He remembered the day he took these pictures in Central Park. The sun was full and bright, and the air wasn\u2019t humid or wet. There was a cool summer breeze, and the fountain looked extra sparkling. (Y/N) stepped around the top of the fountain like a ballerina, her yellow and pink dress bright in the sun. Peter sighed and shut the laptop, laying his head back against the cough and closing his eyes. </p><p>\u201cWe have breaking news here, just coming in from our onsite reporter,\u201d the television spoke. \u201cThere is an armed robbery taking place on Adams and 15<sup>th\u00a0</sup>street, currently two fatalities and police are at a standstill. There are hostages inside.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes flew open and he stood in the living room. On the television, images of the robbery were in place, and Peter knew just were that was. <i>King Garden</i>. There was a bank just down the block, and Peter believed it logical that whoever perpetrated the attack, would have ran down the street, probably cornered by police, and went into the restaurant. He jumped around the couch, ran into is room, pulled out his suit and slipped it on, opening his window and slinging out, flying down the streets in hopes he could make it in time. </p><p>When Peter finally came across the restaurant, he had been right. The place was swarmed by cops, and gun fire admitted every so often. He narrowed his eyes, looking down and numbering how may forces were on the ground, then decided his best bet was flying to the side of the building to not attract unwanted attention, and come in through the kitchen. He knew the backdoor was probably locked, but he could find a way in. He lifted his hand and flung himself on the web over the buildings and around the corners. He slid onto the ground, grabbing onto the side restaurant door and snapping the handle off, kicking the door forward and walked into the kitchen. There were no people in the room. <i>Probably all held in the front</i>, he affirmed, walking down the empty kitchen and towards the entrance of the dining room. He looked out the window on the kitchen door, scanning the group of customers, and the robber who sat behind the hostess desk. Then, on the side of the room, Peter noticed the familiar form and face of (Y/N), huddled underneath a table and holding her legs to her chest. Jonas sat opposite of her, pressed against the wall. She looked around nervously, then, her eyes fell to the kitchen door and they widened. Peter shook his head, raising a finger to his lips. She nodded slightly, making no noise. </p><p>He took a breath, pulled his fist back, and slammed it into the window, a crash emitting from the door. The robber turned their head, shouting. Shot fired from the police cars, and the customers screamed, pulling their hands over their head. Peter retracted his hand and pulled his fingers in, zipping a web out and pulling the weapon from the robber\u2019s hands and slamming it against the door, crashing in minuscule pieces. He kicked open the door, and shot more webs towards the robber, yelling at the customers to get out through the back door. They all ran behind him, and Peter tied the robber to the desk with ease. He punched the criminal down, and stuck his webs to the desk, clipping the robber\u2019s hands together and tying them down. The police outside grabbed the customers, calming them down and calling dispatch on the updates. Peter walked away from the robber and ran out the back door, leaving the Police to collect the felon. </p><p>He swung himself down the streets, the wind breezing through his suit. Making his way to the apartment, he slid himself through the open window and hit against his bed. He pulled the top of the suit off, running and hand through his hair. He walked into the bathroom, running water over his face and taking a deep breath before drying and walking into the living room area. He walked over to the kitchen, pulling out a soda and popping the top off, gulping the sugary drink down in a hurry. His heart was racing, still not used to the feeling of seeing (Y/N) in the restaurant. People being interviewed on the television, spouting praises of him, or better his alter-ego, but he ignored them and closed his eyes, shivering slightly at the sound of the doorbell. His eyes widened and he struggled pulling off the suit and throwing it into his room, pulling on his old high school spirit shirt and a pair of gray sweats. He ran to the door and opened it wide, staring blankly at (Y/N) who stood in the middle of the frame. </p><p>\u201c(Y/N), what are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>She pushed forward, wrapping her arms around his neck and pressing her lips to his. His heart stopped, and he wrapped his arms around her waist securely. He felt small tears drip onto his cheeks from her eyes as she squinted them shut, and he rubbed her back softly. She pulled her face back and tucked it into the crook of his neck, hiccupping and wetting his shirt. He closed his eyes and sighed, holding her close. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m <i>so, so sorry</i>, Peter,\u201d she cried quietly on his shoulder. He frowned and held her tighter. </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to apologize,\u201d he whispered, pushing his face into the side of her head, smelling her sweet shampoo and smiling to himself. \u201cI\u2019ll always be there to protect you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that,\u201d she whispered, pulling away. She looked into his eyes with tears pooling on the rims. \u201cTonight, I thought I was gonna die, and I realized how much I would <i>miss\u00a0</i>you, how much it hurt me to not talk to you, to not forgive you. I shouldn\u2019t have gotten mad, I shouldn\u2019t\u2014.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes, you should have, (Y/N),\u201d he interrupted. \u201cI should have told you. I was being stupid, and I thought I had a better chance at protecting you if you didn\u2019t know. But, I was wrong. I should have talked to you about it.\u201d </p><p>He pressed his hands to her cheeks and kissed her forehead. \u201cI can\u2019t lose you, too,\u201d he whispered softly. Tears fell down her face and she pulled him to herself again, sighing and kissing his jaw softly. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never lose me.\u201d</p>",
