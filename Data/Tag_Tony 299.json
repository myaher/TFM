He should\u2019ve brought a warmer jacket. He had no idea how long he would be sitting out here, finishing up what he should\u2019ve been done with ages ago. What should\u2019ve been done in a warm library in the comfort of daylight.</p><p>This Spider-Man business wasn\u2019t something he ever questioned, but it was moments like this that he wondered if it was worth it.</p><p>(of course it was)</p><p>(always)</p><p>His hands were freezing. He shook them, blew into them, tried again. Wrote three sentences. Repeated. His face was going numb. Was it just him or was it colder that night than usual? The wind was merciless too. Rude. Very rude and unnecessary. The universe was a big old-</p><p>Oh, there was Mr Stark exiting his car on the street before him. Cool. Absolutely tremendous.</p><p>Peter stood, since Tony was looking straight at him, and tried to act natural. \u201cHi, Mr Stark.\u201d</p><p>Tony didn\u2019t reply instantly, but took a few steps closer, as if trying to make sure it was really him. \u201cPete? What the hell are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Peter grinned sheepishly. \u201cUh, finishing an assignment?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Here</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I totally forgot about it, you see, and it\u2019s due midnight, but our internet has been down for weeks and we haven\u2019t been able to call someone to fix it and usually I do homework that require a connection in school or the library or at Ned\u2019s, but it\u2019s way too late to go to either places and then I remembered that the Tower has, like, the best connection in the whole city, so I took a chance and came here, and fortunately it\u2019s very good out here as well and-\u201d</p><p>Tony raised a hand. \u201cBreathe. Please.\u201d</p><p>Peter did, aware of how his teeth were starting to chatter. \u201cSo to answer your question I came here to finish an essay and send it in before the deadline.\u201d</p><p>Tony opened his mouth, closed it, turned to look at Happy who was hovering behind him, before turning back to Peter to say, \u201cYou\u2019re stupid.\u201d Fair enough. \u201cYou could\u2019ve come in, you know. Doesn\u2019t matter if I\u2019m not here. FRIDAY knows you.\u201d Tony shook his head. \u201cJesus, it\u2019s <i>freezing</i>. Come on, I\u2019ll make you tea while you finish your godforsaken homework. Or a hot chocolate. Whatever kids these days drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mr Stark,\u201d Peter said, too cold to act humble. The three of them entered the building, Peter feeling his body thaw, finally. \u201cWhere were you? Before, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA gala thing. Nothing important. How long were you sitting out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty minutes maybe?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cGeez. You should get yourself a warmer jacket.\u201d</p><p>Peter didn\u2019t answer, only moved his now shut laptop from one arm to the other.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the subject?\u201d Tony finally asked as they entered the elevator.</p><p>\u201cEnglish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t take too long then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHopefully not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes May know you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told her I was at Ned\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you. It\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he would\u2019ve let you in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but-\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d Tony\u2019s eyebrows were raised, waiting.</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019d tell me off for waiting until last minute when he\u2019s been reminding me for days,\u201d Peter said sheepishly, and both Tony and Happy snorted. \u201cI genuinely forgot though.\u201d</p><p>Tony gave his back a light slap. \u201cMaybe you need more living calendars.\u201d</p><p>Peter let out a laugh. \u201cEvidently.\u201d</p><p>He settled down in the living room, warm now, shrugging off his jacket and setting up his laptop on his lap again. Happy bid them goodnight, and Tony disappeared into the kitchen, returning a moment later with two cups of tea, one of which Peter accepted gratefully.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for barging in like this,\u201d he said, taking a sip.</p><p>Tony waved a hand at him. \u201cI invited you in. I\u2019d rather have you be here than out there. I know Spidey can\u2019t really get sick, but are you insane?\u201d</p><p>Peter shrugged. \u201cDesperate times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to set up some sort of outside room so people can have wifi and comfort all together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be such a bad idea, actually.\u201d</p><p>So, a week later, Tony did.</p><p>*</p><p>Peter didn\u2019t use the room until several months later, since Tony had always forced him to come inside if he was ever in need of a connection. But that night was different. He\u2019d been stupid, and Tony had scolded him properly for not listening during a battle. Seriously, it almost matched the homecoming telloff. It was safe to say Peter felt too ashamed - and slightly annoyed - to go inside due to the possibility of seeing Tony, so he entered the room, the automatic doors closing behind him, and sat down in one of the seats.</p><p>It was warm, but not uncomfortable, and a vending machine which seemed to be free was standing against one of the walls. He considered getting a hot chocolate, but something about using Mr Stark\u2019s generosity in that moment felt wrong, so he refrained. Merely opened his laptop and started typing.</p><p>Mr Stark found him anyway.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d he asked. Peter had barely heard the doors open.</p><p>He slammed the laptop shut and scrambled to reply. \u201cI can leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, what are you doing here? You know you\u2019re allowed into the Tower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I wasn\u2019t sure you\u2019d want me there.\u201d</p><p>Tony groaned, all long suffering and exhausted. \u201c<i>Pete</i>. Despite how our latest meeting might\u2019ve ended I always want you to be safe. Hell, that\u2019s why we argued in the first place, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Peter thought the term \u2018argued\u2019 seemed a bit too strong, but he didn\u2019t voice that. \u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo stop being childish and come inside. Please.\u201d</p><p>It was the please that made Peter\u2019s feet move. Grabbing his bag and laptop and following Tony into the cold January night, finding himself inside again only a few seconds later. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said quietly, because argument or not, he had manners.</p><p>Tony shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, kid. You\u2019ve eaten?\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>The third time Peter ended up using the wifi sort of outside the Tower, he didn\u2019t actually mean to do it. He was in a hurry, on his way to meet Mr Stark and talk about some recent upgrades and also squeeze in some homework while he was at it, but he almost tripped on his own feet when he passed the wifi room and saw a familiar face, who seemed to see him at the exact same time.</p><p>He paused, watching MJ watching him, until it seemed way too rude to walk past without at least saying hello. He entered.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said, though she didn\u2019t seem surprised to see him. \u201cHere to use the connection?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah, totally,\u201d he said, unable to think of another reason for being in Manhattan. \u201cYou too?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cSort of had to. It\u2019s a bitch getting here, but at least I can read during the commute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been here before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouple of times. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, a couple of times. Too. Yeah.\u201d</p><p>MJ\u2019s lips twitched. She was amused. \u201cYou gonna sit?\u201d</p><p>Peter did, taking the seat across from her as if this was normal. \u201cWhat you working on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssignment for psych. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame. And a lab report for chem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI finished that a few days ago. If you need help, just say the word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p><p>They settled into a semi comfortable silence as MJ returned to her work and Peter started frantically texting Tony under the table about being late. Or possibly not showing up at all. MJ was obviously going the same way as him later, and it\u2019d be rude to not accompany her.</p><p>Yeah, he wasn\u2019t seeing any type of upgrades that day.</p><p>He met up with Mr Stark the next day instead, having Happy drive him just in case he\u2019d get stuck on the way. Tony was smirking when he entered, and Peter felt as if he\u2019d been caught doing something bad or embarrassing. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad fun on your date?\u201d</p><p>Peter spluttered. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a date!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, your red face is telling me otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a friend from school. Really, friend is almost the wrong word. That was the first time we hung out alone, and it was only because she saw me walk past when I was on my way here, I swear.\u201d</p><p>Tony laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re so easy to mess with. Relax.\u201d</p><p>Peter tried to, but there was something about how defensive he\u2019d gotten that he wasn\u2019t willing to come to terms with yet. \u201cUpgrades?\u201d was all he managed to say, and Tony\u2019s grin grew.</p><p>\u201cUpgrades,\u201d he said, clapping his hands together. \u201cI think you\u2019ll like these.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>Peter ended up doing his homework with MJ in the wifi room of the Tower several times after that, and after a while it was as if they had a silent agreement to meet there on certain days, keeping each other company on the train home. Talking, between assignments. It was strange. It was nice. She was funny.</p><p>Mr Stark wasn\u2019t letting him live it down at this point.</p><p>\u201cHow was your date?\u201d he asked as a greeting almost every single time Peter came around. It was one of those rare days where he hadn\u2019t found MJ in the room and had decided to come up instead, his bag heavy with books.</p><p>\u201cNot a date,\u201d he replied automatically.</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d A pause, then, \u201cBut would you like it to have been one?\u201d</p><p>Peter met his eyes, willing himself not to blush, though probably in vain. \u201cNo comment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s comment enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust- offer me tea or something.\u201d</p><p>Tony laughed. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>One day, Mr Stark joined him in the room. Peter had gone in after a mission, feeling drained and not in the mood to try to explain himself. Tony entered half an hour later, took in the way Peter was slumped in his chair in front of his books, and didn\u2019t say a word. Only sat down beside him and took out his pad, doing god knows what with it.</p><p>It was a rare occurrence for the room to be empty of other students now, but spring was approaching and people started enjoying being outside again. Enjoying the combination of sunshine and the still chilly air. Peter could\u2019ve sat outside without dying of cold now, but he didn\u2019t want the questions, so he\u2019d hidden in here.</p><p>Tony finally nudged him, head tilted when he said, \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYeah, just\u2026 tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust needed a break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t blame you.\u201d</p><p>Peter turned to look at him more properly. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaw that you were, so I figured I could check on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t know, I think I\u2019ve gotten attached to you or something.\u201d</p><p>They both laughed, knowing it was an understatement. Peter truly couldn\u2019t picture his life without Mr Stark in it now, and something told him Mr Stark felt the same thing, or at least a similar enough feeling.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Peter raised his eyebrows in acknowledgement. \u201cIf you need to talk I\u2019m here, okay?\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded. Maybe not tonight, but sometime. \u201cThank you, Mr Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it. You wanna go upstairs?\u201d</p><p>Peter did. As much as he appreciated this room, he would always prefer to be invited upstairs.</p>",

Despite how our latest meeting might\u2019ve ended I always want you to be safe.

Please.\u201d</p><p>It was the please that made Peter\u2019s feet move. Grabbing his bag and laptop and following Tony into the cold January night, finding himself inside again only a few seconds later. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said quietly, because argument or not, he had manners.</p><p>Tony shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, kid.

He was in a hurry, on his way to meet Mr Stark and talk about some recent upgrades and also squeeze in some homework while he was at it, but he almost tripped on his own feet when he passed the wifi room and saw a familiar face, who seemed to see him at the exact same time.</p><p>He paused, watching MJ watching him, until it seemed way too rude to walk past without at least saying hello. He entered.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said, though she didn\u2019t seem surprised to see him. \u201cHere to use the connection?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah, totally,\u201d he said, unable to think of another reason for being in Manhattan. \u201cYou too?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cSort of had to. It\u2019s a bitch getting here, but at least I can read during the commute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been here before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouple of times. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, a couple of times. Too. Yeah.\u201d</p><p>MJ\u2019s lips twitched. She was amused. \u201cYou gonna sit?\u201d</p><p>Peter did, taking the seat across from her as if this was normal. \u201cWhat you working on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssignment for psych. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame. And a lab report for chem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI finished that a few days ago.

Really, friend is almost the wrong word. That was the first time we hung out alone, and it was only because she saw me walk past when I was on my way here, I swear.\u201d</p><p>Tony laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re so easy to mess with. Relax.\u201d</p><p>Peter tried to, but there was something about how defensive he\u2019d gotten that he wasn\u2019t willing to come to terms with yet. \u201cUpgrades?\u201d was all he managed to say, and Tony\u2019s grin grew.</p><p>\u201cUpgrades,\u201d he said, clapping his hands together. \u201cI think you\u2019ll like these.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>Peter ended up doing his homework with MJ in the wifi room of the Tower several times after that, and after a while it was as if they had a silent agreement to meet there on certain days, keeping each other company on the train home.

She was funny.</p><p>Mr Stark wasn\u2019t letting him live it down at this point.</p><p>\u201cHow was your date?\u201d he asked as a greeting almost every single time Peter came around.

Peter had gone in after a mission, feeling drained and not in the mood to try to explain himself. Tony entered half an hour later, took in the way Peter was slumped in his chair in front of his books, and didn\u2019t say a word. Only sat down beside him and took out his pad, doing god knows what with it.</p><p>It was a rare occurrence for the room to be empty of other students now, but spring was approaching and people started enjoying being outside again. Enjoying the combination of sunshine and the still chilly air. Peter could\u2019ve sat outside without dying of cold now, but he didn\u2019t want the questions, so he\u2019d hidden in here.</p><p>Tony finally nudged him, head tilted when he said, \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYeah, just\u2026 tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust needed a break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t blame you.\u201d</p><p>Peter turned to look at him more properly. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaw that you were, so I figured I could check on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t know, I think I\u2019ve gotten attached to you or something.\u201d</p><p>They both laughed, knowing it was an understatement. Peter truly couldn\u2019t picture his life without Mr Stark in it now, and something told him Mr Stark felt the same thing, or at least a similar enough feeling.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Peter raised his eyebrows in acknowledgement. \u201cIf you need to talk I\u2019m here, okay?\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded. Maybe not tonight, but sometime. \u201cThank you, Mr Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it. You wanna go upstairs?\u201d</p><p>Peter did. As much as he appreciated this room, he would always prefer to be invited upstairs.</p>",

I hope you like it!<br></b></p><p><b>[<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/15876087\" target=\"_blank\">Read it on AO3</a>]</b></p><p><b>Words: 2 155</b></p><p>It was way too late for Peter to be doing this. The streets, usually busy, only hosted a third amount of the cars that tended to litter it, and while Peter almost collided shoulders with several people as he made his way across the pavement, it was nothing compared to the crowd he had to fight his way through in the daytime. Hence, it was way too late for him to be here, especially since he wasn\u2019t even being Spider-Man tonight.</p><p>He shivered, the November air cruel to him and his thin jacket, but Manhattan har never been known for its warmth. He paused before the building, taller than anything Queens had ever been home to, and allowed himself to exhale. He\u2019d made it this far. Better get used to the view of the dark street, because he wasn\u2019t leaving here anytime soon.</p><p>Peter settled down on the ground, his back against the glass. Anyone could see him, had they decided to look, but Peter had a feeling no one hung around the bottom floor of the Stark Tower. Avengers Tower. Whatever it was called now.</p><p>He pulled out his laptop, balancing on his lap behind the bag he used in an attempt to shield it. He wasn\u2019t entirely sure what he would do if someone tried to rob him. They\u2019d be easy to stop, but that would mean questions later on, so he hoped no one would try. Hoped the bag and the vicinity to Iron Man would deceive them enough.</p><p>What would Mr Stark say if he found him here?</p>[[MORE]]<p>He shivered again as his fingers started moving over the keys, uncertain at first, but slowly picking up speed as his brain caught on. He should\u2019ve brought a warmer jacket. He had no idea how long he would be sitting out here, finishing up what he should\u2019ve been done with ages ago. What should\u2019ve been done in a warm library in the comfort of daylight.</p><p>This Spider-Man business wasn\u2019t something he ever questioned, but it was moments like this that he wondered if it was worth it.</p><p>(of course it was)</p><p>(always)</p><p>His hands were freezing. He shook them, blew into them, tried again. Wrote three sentences. Repeated. His face was going numb. Was it just him or was it colder that night than usual? The wind was merciless too. Rude. Very rude and unnecessary. The universe was a big old-</p><p>Oh, there was Mr Stark exiting his car on the street before him. Cool. Absolutely tremendous.</p><p>Peter stood, since Tony was looking straight at him, and tried to act natural. \u201cHi, Mr Stark.\u201d</p><p>Tony didn\u2019t reply instantly, but took a few steps closer, as if trying to make sure it was really him. \u201cPete? What the hell are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Peter grinned sheepishly. \u201cUh, finishing an assignment?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Here</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I totally forgot about it, you see, and it\u2019s due midnight, but our internet has been down for weeks and we haven\u2019t been able to call someone to fix it and usually I do homework that require a connection in school or the library or at Ned\u2019s, but it\u2019s way too late to go to either places and then I remembered that the Tower has, like, the best connection in the whole city, so I took a chance and came here, and fortunately it\u2019s very good out here as well and-\u201d</p><p>Tony raised a hand. \u201cBreathe. Please.\u201d</p><p>Peter did, aware of how his teeth were starting to chatter. \u201cSo to answer your question I came here to finish an essay and send it in before the deadline.\u201d</p><p>Tony opened his mouth, closed it, turned to look at Happy who was hovering behind him, before turning back to Peter to say, \u201cYou\u2019re stupid.\u201d Fair enough. \u201cYou could\u2019ve come in, you know. Doesn\u2019t matter if I\u2019m not here. FRIDAY knows you.\u201d Tony shook his head. \u201cJesus, it\u2019s <i>freezing</i>. Come on, I\u2019ll make you tea while you finish your godforsaken homework. Or a hot chocolate. Whatever kids these days drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mr Stark,\u201d Peter said, too cold to act humble. The three of them entered the building, Peter feeling his body thaw, finally. \u201cWhere were you? Before, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA gala thing. Nothing important. How long were you sitting out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty minutes maybe?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cGeez. You should get yourself a warmer jacket.\u201d</p><p>Peter didn\u2019t answer, only moved his now shut laptop from one arm to the other.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the subject?\u201d Tony finally asked as they entered the elevator.</p><p>\u201cEnglish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t take too long then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHopefully not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes May know you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told her I was at Ned\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you. It\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he would\u2019ve let you in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but-\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d Tony\u2019s eyebrows were raised, waiting.</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019d tell me off for waiting until last minute when he\u2019s been reminding me for days,\u201d Peter said sheepishly, and both Tony and Happy snorted. \u201cI genuinely forgot though.\u201d</p><p>Tony gave his back a light slap. \u201cMaybe you need more living calendars.\u201d</p><p>Peter let out a laugh. \u201cEvidently.\u201d</p><p>He settled down in the living room, warm now, shrugging off his jacket and setting up his laptop on his lap again. Happy bid them goodnight, and Tony disappeared into the kitchen, returning a moment later with two cups of tea, one of which Peter accepted gratefully.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for barging in like this,\u201d he said, taking a sip.</p><p>Tony waved a hand at him. \u201cI invited you in. I\u2019d rather have you be here than out there. I know Spidey can\u2019t really get sick, but are you insane?\u201d</p><p>Peter shrugged. \u201cDesperate times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to set up some sort of outside room so people can have wifi and comfort all together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be such a bad idea, actually.\u201d</p><p>So, a week later, Tony did.</p><p>*</p><p>Peter didn\u2019t use the room until several months later, since Tony had always forced him to come inside if he was ever in need of a connection. But that night was different. He\u2019d been stupid, and Tony had scolded him properly for not listening during a battle. Seriously, it almost matched the homecoming telloff. It was safe to say Peter felt too ashamed - and slightly annoyed - to go inside due to the possibility of seeing Tony, so he entered the room, the automatic doors closing behind him, and sat down in one of the seats.</p><p>It was warm, but not uncomfortable, and a vending machine which seemed to be free was standing against one of the walls. He considered getting a hot chocolate, but something about using Mr Stark\u2019s generosity in that moment felt wrong, so he refrained. Merely opened his laptop and started typing.</p><p>Mr Stark found him anyway.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d he asked. Peter had barely heard the doors open.</p><p>He slammed the laptop shut and scrambled to reply. \u201cI can leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, what are you doing here? You know you\u2019re allowed into the Tower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I wasn\u2019t sure you\u2019d want me there.\u201d</p><p>Tony groaned, all long suffering and exhausted. \u201c<i>Pete</i>. Despite how our latest meeting might\u2019ve ended I always want you to be safe. Hell, that\u2019s why we argued in the first place, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Peter thought the term \u2018argued\u2019 seemed a bit too strong, but he didn\u2019t voice that. \u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo stop being childish and come inside. Please.\u201d</p><p>It was the please that made Peter\u2019s feet move. Grabbing his bag and laptop and following Tony into the cold January night, finding himself inside again only a few seconds later. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said quietly, because argument or not, he had manners.</p><p>Tony shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, kid. You\u2019ve eaten?\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>The third time Peter ended up using the wifi sort of outside the Tower, he didn\u2019t actually mean to do it. He was in a hurry, on his way to meet Mr Stark and talk about some recent upgrades and also squeeze in some homework while he was at it, but he almost tripped on his own feet when he passed the wifi room and saw a familiar face, who seemed to see him at the exact same time.</p><p>He paused, watching MJ watching him, until it seemed way too rude to walk past without at least saying hello.

It\u2019s a bitch getting here, but at least I can read during the commute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been here before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouple of times. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, a couple of times. Too. Yeah.\u201d</p><p>MJ\u2019s lips twitched. She was amused. \u201cYou gonna sit?\u201d</p><p>Peter did, taking the seat across from her as if this was normal. \u201cWhat you working on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssignment for psych. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame. And a lab report for chem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI finished that a few days ago. If you need help, just say the word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p><p>They settled into a semi comfortable silence as MJ returned to her work and Peter started frantically texting Tony under the table about being late.

Really, friend is almost the wrong word. That was the first time we hung out alone, and it was only because she saw me walk past when I was on my way here, I swear.\u201d</p><p>Tony laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re so easy to mess with. Relax.\u201d</p><p>Peter tried to, but there was something about how defensive he\u2019d gotten that he wasn\u2019t willing to come to terms with yet. \u201cUpgrades?\u201d was all he managed to say, and Tony\u2019s grin grew.</p><p>\u201cUpgrades,\u201d he said, clapping his hands together. \u201cI think you\u2019ll like these.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>Peter ended up doing his homework with MJ in the wifi room of the Tower several times after that, and after a while it was as if they had a silent agreement to meet there on certain days, keeping each other company on the train home.

The streets, usually busy, only hosted a third amount of the cars that tended to litter it, and while Peter almost collided shoulders with several people as he made his way across the pavement, it was nothing compared to the crowd he had to fight his way through in the daytime. Hence, it was way too late for him to be here, especially since he wasn&rsquo;t even being Spider-Man tonight.</p><p>He shivered, the November air cruel to him and his thin jacket, but Manhattan har never been known for its warmth. He paused before the building, taller than anything Queens had ever been home to, and allowed himself to exhale. He&rsquo;d made it this far. Better get used to the view of the dark street, because he wasn&rsquo;t leaving here anytime soon.</p><p>Peter settled down on the ground, his back against the glass. Anyone could see him, had they decided to look, but Peter had a feeling no one hung around the bottom floor of the Stark Tower. Avengers Tower. Whatever it was called now.</p><p>He pulled out his laptop, balancing on his lap behind the bag he used in an attempt to shield it. He wasn&rsquo;t entirely sure what he would do if someone tried to rob him. They&rsquo;d be easy to stop, but that would mean questions later on, so he hoped no one would try. Hoped the bag and the vicinity to Iron Man would deceive them enough.</p><p>What would Mr Stark say if he found him here?</p><p>He shivered again as his fingers started moving over the keys, uncertain at first, but slowly picking up speed as his brain caught on. He should&rsquo;ve brought a warmer jacket. He had no idea how long he would be sitting out here, finishing up what he should&rsquo;ve been done with ages ago. What should&rsquo;ve been done in a warm library in the comfort of daylight.</p><p>This Spider-Man business wasn&rsquo;t something he ever questioned, but it was moments like this that he wondered if it was worth it.</p><p>(of course it was)</p><p>(always)</p><p>His hands were freezing. He shook them, blew into them, tried again. Wrote three sentences. Repeated. His face was going numb. Was it just him or was it colder that night than usual? The wind was merciless too. Rude. Very rude and unnecessary. The universe was a big old-</p><p>Oh, there was Mr Stark exiting his car on the street before him. Cool. Absolutely tremendous.</p><p>Peter stood, since Tony was looking straight at him, and tried to act natural. &ldquo;Hi, Mr Stark.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony didn&rsquo;t reply instantly, but took a few steps closer, as if trying to make sure it was really him. &ldquo;Pete? What the hell are you doing here?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter grinned sheepishly. &ldquo;Uh, finishing an assignment?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Here</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I totally forgot about it, you see, and it&rsquo;s due midnight, but our internet has been down for weeks and we haven&rsquo;t been able to call someone to fix it and usually I do homework that require a connection in school or the library or at Ned&rsquo;s, but it&rsquo;s way too late to go to either places and then I remembered that the Tower has, like, the best connection in the whole city, so I took a chance and came here, and fortunately it&rsquo;s very good out here as well and-&rdquo;</p><p>Tony raised a hand. &ldquo;Breathe. Please.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter did, aware of how his teeth were starting to chatter. &ldquo;So to answer your question I came here to finish an essay and send it in before the deadline.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony opened his mouth, closed it, turned to look at Happy who was hovering behind him, before turning back to Peter to say, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re stupid.&rdquo; Fair enough. &ldquo;You could&rsquo;ve come in, you know. Doesn&rsquo;t matter if I&rsquo;m not here. FRIDAY knows you.&rdquo; Tony shook his head. &ldquo;Jesus, it&rsquo;s <i>freezing</i>. Come on, I&rsquo;ll make you tea while you finish your godforsaken homework. Or a hot chocolate. Whatever kids these days drink.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mr Stark,&rdquo; Peter said, too cold to act humble. The three of them entered the building, Peter feeling his body thaw, finally. &ldquo;Where were you? Before, I mean.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A gala thing. Nothing important. How long were you sitting out there?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Twenty minutes maybe?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Geez. You should get yourself a warmer jacket.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter didn&rsquo;t answer, only moved his now shut laptop from one arm to the other.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the subject?&rdquo; Tony finally asked as they entered the elevator.</p><p>&ldquo;English.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t take too long then.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hopefully not.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Does May know you&rsquo;re here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I told her I was at Ned&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And why aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I told you. It&rsquo;s too late.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he would&rsquo;ve let you in.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe, but-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But?&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s eyebrows were raised, waiting.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;d tell me off for waiting until last minute when he&rsquo;s been reminding me for days,&rdquo; Peter said sheepishly, and both Tony and Happy snorted. &ldquo;I genuinely forgot though.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony gave his back a light slap. &ldquo;Maybe you need more living calendars.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter let out a laugh. &ldquo;Evidently.&rdquo;</p><p>He settled down in the living room, warm now, shrugging off his jacket and setting up his laptop on his lap again. Happy bid them goodnight, and Tony disappeared into the kitchen, returning a moment later with two cups of tea, one of which Peter accepted gratefully.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for barging in like this,&rdquo; he said, taking a sip.</p><p>Tony waved a hand at him. &ldquo;I invited you in. I&rsquo;d rather have you be here than out there. I know Spidey can&rsquo;t really get sick, but are you insane?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter shrugged. &ldquo;Desperate times.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I need to set up some sort of outside room so people can have wifi and comfort all together.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t be such a bad idea, actually.&rdquo;</p><p>So, a week later, Tony did.</p><p>*</p><p>Peter didn&rsquo;t use the room until several months later, since Tony had always forced him to come inside if he was ever in need of a connection. But that night was different. He&rsquo;d been stupid, and Tony had scolded him properly for not listening during a battle. Seriously, it almost matched the homecoming telloff. It was safe to say Peter felt too ashamed - and slightly annoyed - to go inside due to the possibility of seeing Tony, so he entered the room, the automatic doors closing behind him, and sat down in one of the seats.</p><p>It was warm, but not uncomfortable, and a vending machine which seemed to be free was standing against one of the walls. He considered getting a hot chocolate, but something about using Mr Stark&rsquo;s generosity in that moment felt wrong, so he refrained. Merely opened his laptop and started typing.</p><p>Mr Stark found him anyway.</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you here?&rdquo; he asked. Peter had barely heard the doors open.</p><p>He slammed the laptop shut and scrambled to reply. &ldquo;I can leave.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, no, what are you doing here? You know you&rsquo;re allowed into the Tower.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I wasn&rsquo;t sure you&rsquo;d want me there.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony groaned, all long suffering and exhausted. &ldquo;<i>Pete</i>. Despite how our latest meeting might&rsquo;ve ended I always want you to be safe. Hell, that&rsquo;s why we argued in the first place, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter thought the term &lsquo;argued&rsquo; seemed a bit too strong, but he didn&rsquo;t voice that. &ldquo;I guess.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So stop being childish and come inside. Please.&rdquo;</p><p>It was the please that made Peter&rsquo;s feet move. Grabbing his bag and laptop and following Tony into the cold January night, finding himself inside again only a few seconds later. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said quietly, because argument or not, he had manners.</p><p>Tony shook his head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, kid. You&rsquo;ve eaten?&rdquo;</p><p>*</p><p>The third time Peter ended up using the wifi sort of outside the Tower, he didn&rsquo;t actually mean to do it. He was in a hurry, on his way to meet Mr Stark and talk about some recent upgrades and also squeeze in some homework while he was at it, but he almost tripped on his own feet when he passed the wifi room and saw a familiar face, who seemed to see him at the exact same time.</p><p>He paused, watching MJ watching him, until it seemed way too rude to walk past without at least saying hello. He entered.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; she said, though she didn&rsquo;t seem surprised to see him. &ldquo;Here to use the connection?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, yeah, totally,&rdquo; he said, unable to think of another reason for being in Manhattan. &ldquo;You too?&rdquo;</p><p>She shrugged. &ldquo;Sort of had to. It&rsquo;s a bitch getting here, but at least I can read during the commute.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have you been here before?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Couple of times. You?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, a couple of times. Too. Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>MJ&rsquo;s lips twitched. She was amused. &ldquo;You gonna sit?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter did, taking the seat across from her as if this was normal. &ldquo;What you working on?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Assignment for psych. You?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Same. And a lab report for chem.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I finished that a few days ago. If you need help, just say the word.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Got it.&rdquo;</p><p>They settled into a semi comfortable silence as MJ returned to her work and Peter started frantically texting Tony under the table about being late. Or possibly not showing up at all. MJ was obviously going the same way as him later, and it&rsquo;d be rude to not accompany her.</p><p>Yeah, he wasn&rsquo;t seeing any type of upgrades that day.</p><p>He met up with Mr Stark the next day instead, having Happy drive him just in case he&rsquo;d get stuck on the way. Tony was smirking when he entered, and Peter felt as if he&rsquo;d been caught doing something bad or embarrassing. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Had fun on your date?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter spluttered. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t a date!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, well, your red face is telling me otherwise.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a friend from school. Really, friend is almost the wrong word. That was the first time we hung out alone, and it was only because she saw me walk past when I was on my way here, I swear.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony laughed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re so easy to mess with. Relax.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter tried to, but there was something about how defensive he&rsquo;d gotten that he wasn&rsquo;t willing to come to terms with yet. &ldquo;Upgrades?&rdquo; was all he managed to say, and Tony&rsquo;s grin grew.</p><p>&ldquo;Upgrades,&rdquo; he said, clapping his hands together. &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ll like these.&rdquo;</p><p>*</p><p>Peter ended up doing his homework with MJ in the wifi room of the Tower several times after that, and after a while it was as if they had a silent agreement to meet there on certain days, keeping each other company on the train home. Talking, between assignments. It was strange. It was nice. She was funny.</p><p>Mr Stark wasn&rsquo;t letting him live it down at this point.</p><p>&ldquo;How was your date?&rdquo; he asked as a greeting almost every single time Peter came around. It was one of those rare days where he hadn&rsquo;t found MJ in the room and had decided to come up instead, his bag heavy with books.</p><p>&ldquo;Not a date,&rdquo; he replied automatically.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo; A pause, then, &ldquo;But would you like it to have been one?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter met his eyes, willing himself not to blush, though probably in vain. &ldquo;No comment.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s comment enough.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just- offer me tea or something.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony laughed. &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>One day, Mr Stark joined him in the room. Peter had gone in after a mission, feeling drained and not in the mood to try to explain himself. Tony entered half an hour later, took in the way Peter was slumped in his chair in front of his books, and didn&rsquo;t say a word. Only sat down beside him and took out his pad, doing god knows what with it.</p><p>It was a rare occurrence for the room to be empty of other students now, but spring was approaching and people started enjoying being outside again. Enjoying the combination of sunshine and the still chilly air. Peter could&rsquo;ve sat outside without dying of cold now, but he didn&rsquo;t want the questions, so he&rsquo;d hidden in here.</p><p>Tony finally nudged him, head tilted when he said, &ldquo;You okay?&rdquo;</p><p>He shrugged. &ldquo;Yeah, just&hellip; tired.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just needed a break.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t blame you.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter turned to look at him more properly. &ldquo;Why are you here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Saw that you were, so I figured I could check on you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nice.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know, I think I&rsquo;ve gotten attached to you or something.&rdquo;</p><p>They both laughed, knowing it was an understatement.

        "body": "<p>Tony Stark:<br/>\nWhen he&rsquo;s around the compound he usually smells like oil, spray paint or gasoline due to the amount of time he spends working on his suits, cars, etc.<br/>\nWhen expecting company, or when he goes out he always smells like his favorite expensive cologne, and occasionally hair gel.</p>\n\n<p>Steve Rogers:<br/>\nMost of the time he only faintly smells like shaving cream, but usually Steve has a more neutral scent, not really liking scented soaps, he has also been known to smell like various fruits on occasion, since he likes eating healthy and all.</p>\n\n<p>Thor:<br/>\nHe has the natural smell of thunderstorms and rain around him, understandable considering what he&rsquo;s the god of, alternatively he has been known to smell like a campfire oddly enough.</p>\n\n<p>Bruce:<br/>\nBruce smells like antiseptics, but not overwhelming, nothing like a hospital, but faintly, underneath whatever subtle cologne he is wearing that day.<br/>\nHe has to be careful what cologne he wears though, a few brands have been known to give the hulk an allergic reaction, which has more than once ended with a very irritated hulk scratching his back against the walls.</p>\n\n<p>Clint Barton:<br/>\nClint has been known to, oddly enough, smell like nature itself, pine trees, honeysuckle, waterlilies and all that.</p>\n\n<p>Natasha:<br/>\nFun fact, Natasha doesn&rsquo;t keep the same scent very long, usually changing up her shampoo or bodywash scent every mission or so, since that&rsquo;s what she has gotten used to in some of her training, never keep the same scent too long.<br/>\nAmong the various scents she has used though Japanese cherry blossom seems to pop up more often than other scents.</p>\n\n<p>Loki:<br/>\nHis natural scent is icy and cold, like a blizzard, but it&rsquo;s a pleasant and subtle scent, aside from that scent, he has sometimes been said to smell like peppermints or to even have the pleasant aroma of leather, although that&rsquo;s probably just the armor.<br/>\nAn anonymous source said when she seen him last on Midgard that he &ldquo;smelled like mint chocolate icecream, good enough to eat&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m not going to comment on that statement because what I want to say could be taken as weird.</p>\n\n<p>Sam Wilson:<br/>\nGod blessed us with this cutie, he smells like baby lotion most of the time, for god sakes, can it get any better?</p>\n\n<p>James Rhodes:<br/>\nHe smells like the ocean, or a beach, just any beautiful body of water honestly.</p>\n\n<p>Director Fury:<br/>\nNo one has ever been brave enough to inhale, much less sniff around Nick Fury, but if I had to guess, I bet he smells dangerous, maybe like a room full of polished knives, or a freshly discharged gun.<br/>\nPerhaps he smells like synthetic leather or essential oils, but maybe he smells like explosives or a taser.<br/>\nNo one may ever truly know.</p>\n\n<p>Bucky Barnes:<br/>\nUnlike Steve, he loves scented soaps, one scent he really enjoys is strawberries, sure, he was an assassin and all, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean he can&rsquo;t smell like strawberries now since he&rsquo;s got his mind back.<br/>\nI also dare you to give him shit about his hair smelling like strawberry conditioner, I DARE YOU.</p>\n\n<p>T'challa:<br/>\nI didn&rsquo;t know someone could smell like satin bedsheets, but this king smells like satin bedsheets.<br/>\nI DIDN&rsquo;T EVEN KNOW SATIN BEDSHEETS HAD A SCENT?<br/>\nEither Way, I believe angels probably smell like him.</p>\n\n<p>Scott Lang:<br/>\nHe sort of always smells like a bakery or something.<br/>\nEither he smells like cinnamon rolls, brownies, freshly baked cookies or a chocolate cake, and everything sweet in between.</p>\n\n<p>Vision:<br/>\nCan a walking toaster even smell like anything other than a walking toaster?

And\nit\u2019s on me to fix it.\u201d</p><p>Rhodes motions to someone behind Steve, and Steve whips\naround only to come face to face with two policemen, one of them holding\nhandcuffs at the ready.</p><p>\u201cSteven Grant Rogers, you\u2019re under arrest for the attempted\nmurder of Anthony Edward Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-no\u2026\u201d \u00a0He staggers\nback a step, shaking his head in denial. \n\u201cNo, no, no, you can\u2019t\u2026 you can\u2019t do that. \u00a0I didn\u2019t\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did,\u201d Rhodes interjects coldly \u2013 a solid impenetrable\nwall at his back, keeping him trapped in place. \n\u201cAnd I <i>can</i>, as the highest\nranking officer on this team\u2026 and as Tony\u2019s friend. \u00a0And if Tony dies\u2026\u201d \u00a0Rhodes\u2019 voice gives out \u2013 a minute, momentary\nslip. \u00a0\u201cIf he dies,\u201d he continues hoarsely,\n\u201cI will make sure you go down for his murder.\u201d</p><p>Steve lets them snap the handcuffs on wrists, too stunned to\nput up a fight. \u00a0He can\u2019t process this,\ncan\u2019t understand how any of this is possible. \nHow he misjudged things so badly, misjudged Tony, misjudged himself\u2026</p><p>\u201cIs Tony\u2026 is he really\u2026,\u201d he stutters out, suddenly\nuncertain, \u201chow bad is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou blew a hole in his side, Rogers!\u201d </p><p>The anguished roar pulls him up short, knocks the air out of\nhis lungs. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d He closes his mouths, swallows tightly, his gaze\nflicking once again to the double glass doors behind the Colonel. \u00a0\u201cHe was awake,\u201d he tries lamely, looking back\nat Rhodes\u2026 for confirmation?

&nbsp;He <i>felt </i>Tony die in his arms.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh god&hellip;&rdquo; &nbsp;The words\ntumble past his suddenly numb lips, his own heart stuttering to a stop, and he\nfeels cold all over &ndash; a painful, bone-deep cold that seems horrifyingly\nfamiliar somehow. &nbsp;<i>&lsquo;I wish you stayed in the ice,&rdquo; </i>the kid&rsquo;s parting words echo accusingly\nin his mind, and he thinks that maybe he&rsquo;s back there again, maybe he never\nleft.</p><p>A hand grips his bicep, one of the officers urging him\nalong, and he shakes off the momentary stupor, digs in his heels.</p><p>&ldquo;Do they know if&hellip; The surgery&hellip; Can I at least stay and&hellip;&rdquo; &nbsp;He frowns at the unequivocal angry shake of\nthe head he gets in response to his fumbled plea. &nbsp;Licks his lips. &nbsp;Tries again. \n&ldquo;Please, Rhodes, you gotta at least let me see him. &nbsp;I need to&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; &nbsp;Rhodes&rsquo; voice leaves\nno room for objections. &nbsp;&ldquo;The only thing\nI gotta do is keep my friend safe from people like you. &nbsp;Something I should have done long ago.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I never meant to hurt him, Rhodes, you gotta believe\nme. &nbsp;I just&hellip; I wanna have a chance to\ntell him that. &nbsp;Please!&rdquo;</p><p>The Colonel&rsquo;s cheek twitches in anger, the corners of his\nmouth pinching. &nbsp;&ldquo;This is not how it\nworks, Rogers,&rdquo; he responds, grim and implacable. &nbsp;&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get to appease your conscience\nhere. &nbsp;Not again. &nbsp;You wanna live up to what&rsquo;s left of your\nreputation, then go with these two officers and face the music.&rdquo; </p><p>He nods to the policemen, and Steve feels an insistent tug on\nhis arm again.</p><p>&ldquo;And my team?&rdquo; he asks dazedly, his mind still reeling &ndash; all\nof this &ndash; too much, too much, too much. \nHis teammates are all here, he knows. \nHe passed them on his way through the lobby. &nbsp;But none of them approached him, none of them\neven spoke to him as he walked by. &nbsp;Not\neven Bucky. &nbsp;And he doesn&rsquo;t know what to\nmake of that.</p><p>&ldquo;A team isn&rsquo;t a team if the trust within it is broken,&rdquo;\nRhodes tells him &ndash; a cold statement of fact. \n&ldquo;And we need a strong united front to face what&rsquo;s coming &ndash; unquestionable\ntrust in leadership and in each other. &nbsp; Your former teammates, including Sergeant\nBarnes, have expressed a desire to work with us on those terms, and I&rsquo;m willing\nto give them another try.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>Rhodes watches him darkly as if expecting him to say\nsomething else, but all Steve can do is blink silently back at him, Rhodes&rsquo; words\npulling the last of the ground from under his feet. &nbsp;The Colonel shrugs after a moment, waves to\nthe officers with a parting, &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s one good thing that came from your\nactions, Rogers, it&rsquo;s that your team has become united in their condemnation of\nthem. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m gratified to see that they, at least, understand reason better than you do.&rdquo;</p><p>This time Steve doesn&rsquo;t resist, follows woodenly as the\nofficers guide him back to the exit door. \nThere&rsquo;s no point. &nbsp;Not anymore.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he says, glancing at Rhodes one last time. &nbsp;</p><p>But Rhodes doesn&rsquo;t respond to him, looks away, shaking his\nhead with an expression of tired disgust.</p><p><i>Right</i>, Steve\nthinks mournfully, guilt and despair settling heavily in his bones, making his\nknees weak with the weight of it all. &nbsp;<i>Fool me once&hellip;</i></p>",
