For some reason, I kept calling him &ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; and I remember complaining to him about what happened to Iron Man (I think I was talking about the Avengers endgame trailer when he was stuck in space). He just laughed it off. </p><p>The next thing I knew, he had some free time and wanted to chill out with me. So, we went to this random store and we were skimming through the aisles, chatting. We stopped at one aisle with plushies and we talked about which ones we wanted (I wanted Kirby). </p><p>We finished shopping and returned to the airport. I remembered telling him something about how people had mistreated me and he got annoyed. I told him I had brushed aside their comments and it didn&rsquo;t bother me anymore. I can&rsquo;t remember what he said, but I knew it was something like they didn&rsquo;t realise what they&rsquo;re missing out on. </p><p>What struck me about this dream, was that it felt like we were friends and that we knew each other for a while.

Now that he basically lived in the tower with Tony he had an idea. </p><p>\u201cMr. Stark?\u201d Peter just got back from patrolling after saving a little boys cat from a tree. </p><p>\u201cYeah, kiddo?\u201d Tony was working on something in his lab but Peter wasn\u2019t paying any attention to what it was. </p><p>\u201cYou know how I love cats but I never got one. And I know you say you hate cats and all but I know Pepper loves them&hellip;\u201d Tony knew what was coming so he stopped him before he rambles on too much. </p><p>\u201cYou want a cat? Like you just said, I hate cats. I\u2019ve always hated cats. We\u2019re not getting a cat.\u201d </p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d Peter flashes his puppy dog eyes. They almost always worked on Tony but not this time.</p><p>\u201cI said no kid.\u201d Tony tried not sounding too mean but still firm. \u201cNow come help me with this, I need your small fingers.\u201d</p><p>Peter ignored the cat thing mostly, other than a few subtle \u201cYour stressed? Studies show petting cats relieve stress.\u201d and \u201cCat purrs actually help healing.\u201d</p><p>The next day went by slow for Peter, he couldn\u2019t do what he wanted to do until after school. Finally the bell rang, he ran outside and to the animal shelter, he had to go quickly because Mr. Stark would worry if he took to long but he had to fine the perfect one. </p><p>Shadow but cute but didn\u2019t seem to like being picked up or socializing in general. </p><p>Buddy was cute too but was sleeping the whole time and didn\u2019t seem like he would do much other than sleep and Peter wanted a more active one. </p><p>Mr. Whiskers seemed a little <i>too</i> hyper, jumping around and meowing a bunch. </p><p>Peter thought there wasn\u2019t going to be the one until he found her. She didn\u2019t have a name yet but he thought of a perfect one as soon as he saw her. She was perfect. She was a reddish-orange with two bright blue eyes, she even had a white patch of fur on her chest, and she was so, so fluffy. She was sitting there licking her paw and he asked the worker if he could hold her. She was calm and let him pick her up. </p><p>He knew she was the one. </p><p>He got her and brought her to the tower after picking the name. When pepper saw her she fell in love. \u201cTony, said you could get a cat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, not exactly. I thought maybe if he saw her he would like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell lets go show him\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYou got a cat?!\u201d Tong was angry but Peter could sense something else too. \u201cI said no cats!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony, the kid wanted a cat. Let him keep her. I mean look how cute she is!\u201d Pepper held her up.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say it\u2019s name was?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Her </i>name is,\u201d Pepper looked at Peter then to the cat then to Tony. \u201cIron-Cat aka Tiny Stark \u201d</p><p>\u201cIron-Cat? Tiny Stark? Are you serious? You named it Iron-Cat?\u201d Peter was impressed with himself with his play on words. </p><p>Peter was silent knowing Mr. Stark was angry. \u201cWhat else? She\u2019s red, has blue eyes, and even has a white patch on her chest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy arc-reactor is blue\u201d</p><p>\u201cCats don\u2019t come in blue\u201d Peter spoke up. </p><p>Tony chuckled \u201calright let me see this Iron-Crap\u201d he faked coughed \u201cI mean Iron-Cat.\u201d </p><p>Pepper smirked and handed her to Tony. \u201cShe smells.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe just got her, she needs a bath.\u201d Tony set her down.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s gonna feed her and clean the litter box?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will\u201d Peter didn\u2019t want to clean out a litter box but he would for Iron-Cat.</p><p>\u201cWhatever, but she\u2019s not aloud in the lab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d Peter was thrilled he could keep her. </p><p><br/></p><p>Over the next few days Peter could tell Mr. Stark liked her. He saw him pet her when he thought no one was looking and even saw him talk to her once. It was movie night and they were sitting on the couch when Iron-Cat jumped up and Peter could see Mr. Stark wanted to pet her. \u201cMr. Stark, I\u2019ve seen you pet her, I know you like her, you can pet her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?! No I don\u2019t. I hate cats.\u201d It was silent for a moment while Peter and Pepper looked at Tony. He finally gave in picked up Iron-Cat and she stared to purr. \u201cAssholes. Play the movie</p><p>\u201cI knew you liked her\u201d</p>",
