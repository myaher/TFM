Scorsese was doing long before them and,\nquite frankly, doing it better. There\u2019s not one cut in that whole beat. You\u2019re\nessentially a prisoner of the camera. </i></p><p>The other thing these two scenes have in common is a bit more subtle and\nrequires a larger view of both these characters. Because leaving aside the\ndifferent time periods, dragons and wardrobes, what both these scenes show us\nis the violence that these men are capable of. </p><p>In Goodfellas, up until this point, the audience has seen Henry as the\nhero, the good guy. We\u2019ve been lulled into liking him because of his charm,\ngood looks and intelligence and also because he\u2019s always surrounded by psychopaths\nthat kill and hurt people on a whim while he\u2019s stuck being the voice of reason.\n</p><p>So just when we\u2019ve become comfortable with this interpretation of the\ncharacter, Scorsese gives us 10 veeery loooong and veeery painful seconds of\nHenry\u2019s unhinged brutality. We can\u2019t hide away from the truth anymore: he\u2019s a thug\njust like the rest of his \u201cassociates\u201d.</p><p>The GOT scene is less elegant in its message and perhaps a bit less\neffective but it essentially tells us the same thing. Jon has been dabbling with\nviolence ever since he left home but we have never seen him be so brutal or so\nout of control with anyone. Now we know that if you push him hard enough,\nyou\u2019ll find the monster hidden beneath. The fact that it\u2019s Sansa that sparks this\nrevelation, just as Karen does for Henry, is just icing on the cake, really. </p><p>The other intriguing thing is that both these scenes end with a\nrelationship set-up between Henry and Karen, as well as Jon and Sansa. </p><p>In Goodfellas, this is a patently negative and foreboding event. Henry\nand Karen have been established as the young, attractive and in love couple,\nstrolling around town and going to the Copacabana for drinks, wearing the\nlatest fashions. But in this scene Henry hands her the gun he\u2019s just used to\nbash a man\u2019s face in and asks her to hide it. When she accepts, she becomes his\naccomplice. And that dynamic pays off throughout the rest of the film, as we\nsee Karen smuggle illegal drugs for Henry in prison, accompany him to meet Colombian\ncartels and flush drugs down toilets as the police descends on their house. </p><p>In GOT, the implications of this scene are far more positive. Because\nJon does the exact opposite to what Henry does. Far from making Sansa an accomplice\nto his violent tendencies, he stops himself when she shows up because he\ndoesn\u2019t want her to see him as a monster. </p><p>As other Jonsa fans have already mentioned, the creators here employ the\n\u201ccalm to his storm\u201d trope and that\u2019s a very potent storytelling device. Because\nlove is a powerful emotion that can make us behave in extreme ways, both good\nand bad. But at its best, love compels us to be better, not worse. And that\u2019s\nwhat Sansa does for Jon in this scene. She reminds him of his inherent humanity.\nAnd that\u2019s pretty damn beautiful. </p><p>However, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve really gotten a proper pay off of this\ntrope and the dynamic that it establishes between these two characters. I\nsuppose you could argue that the battlement scene does that by having Sansa\napologize for keeping Jon in the dark about the Knights of the Vale and they end\nup resolving their trust issues. </p><p>Except that season 7 shows us a Jon and Sansa that are still struggling\nwith their relationship, the two of them still sending each other mixed signals\nand we never get a proper explanation as to what makes them clash as they do. </p><p>Add to that the Theon scene where once again the \u201ccalm to his storm\u201d\ntrope is brought to the fore and this whole confusing dynamic between them\nfeels like a dangling plot thread that needs to be addressed in season 8. </p><p><b>The \u201cNon-platonic thoughts about Sansa are not\nallowed in Jon\u2019s presence\u201d scene:</b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dd1-OAG9u43s\"><iframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/d1-OAG9u43s?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></figure><p>The obvious thing that this scene and the Goodfellas scene have in\ncommon is the dialogue. So let\u2019s talk about that. You all know how attached I\nam to my dialogue: </p><blockquote><p>Henry: I swear on my fucking mother, if you touch her again, you\u2019re\ndead!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Jon: Touch my sister and I\u2019ll kill you myself.</p></blockquote><p>Now, Henry is a little more verbose and he does take his own mother\u2019s\nname in vain but you know \u2026 he\u2019s half Irish and half Italian. It sort of comes\nwith the territory. But the message is clear: Touch Karen/Sansa and Henry/Jon\nwill kill you. </p><p>This phrase of: touch \u2026 and I\u2019ll kill you is used a great deal in\ndialogue for both visual and written storytelling but the important common\nthread here is the sexual context in which they are both used. </p><p>Bruce, Karen\u2019s neighbor, is beaten up by Henry because he tried to rape\nKaren. So \u201ctouch\u201d in that context is unquestioningly sexual in nature. </p><p>The Jon/LF is even more loaded because Littlefinger hasn\u2019t actually done\nanything as terrible to Sansa. Sure, his longing stares, double-entendres and creepy\nkisses are more than a little problematic, but they\u2019re not in the same league\nas what Bruce did to Karen. And yet, just the thought that Littlefinger might\napproach Sansa in that way and that he might touch her in a sexual manner,\ndrives Jon mad. </p><p>Also, as others have mentioned, Littlefinger prods and twists Jon for\nquite some time until he snaps. He talks about his father\u2019s bones, his love for\nhis father\u2019s wife and even brings up Catelyn\u2019s dislike for him, something that\nprobably bothers Jon even more than being called a bastard. And yet, even\nthough it\u2019s clear that Jon doesn\u2019t like LF, he still manages to keep his\nemotions in check.</p><p>The moment he starts losing it this: </p><blockquote><p>Littlefinger: If it weren\u2019t for me, you would have been slaughtered on\nthat battlefield. </p></blockquote><p>Now, people simply take it for granted that Jon dislikes Littlefinger\nbecause of what LF has done to his family. But Jon doesn\u2019t know most of what LF\nhas done. He actually doesn\u2019t know much of anything about him. Except this: </p><blockquote><p>Jon: You told me he sold you to the Boltons. </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sansa: He did. </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Jon: Do you trust him?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sansa: Only a fool would trust Littlefinger. </p></blockquote><p>So his sole reason for disliking this man is because of what he did to\nSansa. I would suggest that LF bringing up the Battle of the Bastards is yet\nanother reminder for Jon that she had to bring this man there in order to save\nhim. </p><p>But then LF, in his desire to find what moves his enemy, ups the ante and boy,\ndoes he find out what moves Jon Snow: </p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/95720ea905645b4dcaf912f1f68f6902/tumblr_inline_pf5zd6u1OS1ufeb46_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fe61fdd9b1aecf048adca1d385d1a7a6/tumblr_inline_pf5zdiTjDH1ufeb46_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c7d30f3c44480f3c925e06edd84f35e2/tumblr_inline_pf5zdspMyx1ufeb46_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"/></figure><p>And this where that feeling of familiarity strikes me again.

No one does crazy, out of my mind\npsychopathy quite like good ol\u2019 Ray. </i></p><p>The last thing we need to address is the reason why this scene is even\nincluded. Unlike the mirror scene in season 1 where Ned chocked LF, where the\nresolution was LF\u2019s betrayal, there is no direct pay-off to this scene and\nthere never will be. LF is dead and his downfall has nothing to do with Jon. </p><p>As <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2mI02eDjTFrdK0dolpd95g\">@kitten1618x</a>\u00a0pointed out in\nher message, it can\u2019t be to show us that Jon is\nprotective of Sansa. That was already established in season 6. We\u2019ve seen him\nbeat Ramsay to a pulp and we\u2019ve also been given this gem: </p><blockquote><p>Jon: I will\nnever let him touch you again. I\u2019ll protect you. I promise!</p></blockquote><p>We\u2019re also going\nto be given a fresh dose of that in his scene with Tyrion. </p><p>There\u2019s just so\nmuch of the \u201cJon is an overprotective older brother who protects his totally\nplatonic but in need of protection sister\u201d shtick we can watch before we start\nquestioning exactly why Jon is so invested in who \u201ctouches\u201d Sansa. </p><p>I would argue that,\nconsidering basic scriptwriting structure as well as the pattern that is\nestablished between Jon and the men in Sansa\u2019s life, the pay-off to the Jon/LF\nscene will come in season 8 and it will have nothing to do with LF and\neverything to do with the Jon/Sansa dynamic. </p><p><i>PS: I call dibs on red for the wedding.

Scorsese was doing long before them and,\nquite frankly, doing it better. There\u2019s not one cut in that whole beat. You\u2019re\nessentially a prisoner of the camera. </i></p><p>The other thing these two scenes have in common is a bit more subtle and\nrequires a larger view of both these characters. Because leaving aside the\ndifferent time periods, dragons and wardrobes, what both these scenes show us\nis the violence that these men are capable of. </p><p>In Goodfellas, up until this point, the audience has seen Henry as the\nhero, the good guy. We\u2019ve been lulled into liking him because of his charm,\ngood looks and intelligence and also because he\u2019s always surrounded by psychopaths\nthat kill and hurt people on a whim while he\u2019s stuck being the voice of reason.\n</p><p>So just when we\u2019ve become comfortable with this interpretation of the\ncharacter, Scorsese gives us 10 veeery loooong and veeery painful seconds of\nHenry\u2019s unhinged brutality. We can\u2019t hide away from the truth anymore: he\u2019s a thug\njust like the rest of his \u201cassociates\u201d.</p><p>The GOT scene is less elegant in its message and perhaps a bit less\neffective but it essentially tells us the same thing. Jon has been dabbling with\nviolence ever since he left home but we have never seen him be so brutal or so\nout of control with anyone. Now we know that if you push him hard enough,\nyou\u2019ll find the monster hidden beneath. The fact that it\u2019s Sansa that sparks this\nrevelation, just as Karen does for Henry, is just icing on the cake, really. </p><p>The other intriguing thing is that both these scenes end with a\nrelationship set-up between Henry and Karen, as well as Jon and Sansa. </p><p>In Goodfellas, this is a patently negative and foreboding event. Henry\nand Karen have been established as the young, attractive and in love couple,\nstrolling around town and going to the Copacabana for drinks, wearing the\nlatest fashions. But in this scene Henry hands her the gun he\u2019s just used to\nbash a man\u2019s face in and asks her to hide it. When she accepts, she becomes his\naccomplice. And that dynamic pays off throughout the rest of the film, as we\nsee Karen smuggle illegal drugs for Henry in prison, accompany him to meet Colombian\ncartels and flush drugs down toilets as the police descends on their house. </p><p>In GOT, the implications of this scene are far more positive. Because\nJon does the exact opposite to what Henry does. Far from making Sansa an accomplice\nto his violent tendencies, he stops himself when she shows up because he\ndoesn\u2019t want her to see him as a monster. </p><p>As other Jonsa fans have already mentioned, the creators here employ the\n\u201ccalm to his storm\u201d trope and that\u2019s a very potent storytelling device. Because\nlove is a powerful emotion that can make us behave in extreme ways, both good\nand bad. But at its best, love compels us to be better, not worse. And that\u2019s\nwhat Sansa does for Jon in this scene. She reminds him of his inherent humanity.\nAnd that\u2019s pretty damn beautiful. </p><p>However, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve really gotten a proper pay off of this\ntrope and the dynamic that it establishes between these two characters. I\nsuppose you could argue that the battlement scene does that by having Sansa\napologize for keeping Jon in the dark about the Knights of the Vale and they end\nup resolving their trust issues. </p><p>Except that season 7 shows us a Jon and Sansa that are still struggling\nwith their relationship, the two of them still sending each other mixed signals\nand we never get a proper explanation as to what makes them clash as they do. </p><p>Add to that the Theon scene where once again the \u201ccalm to his storm\u201d\ntrope is brought to the fore and this whole confusing dynamic between them\nfeels like a dangling plot thread that needs to be addressed in season 8. </p><p><b>The \u201cNon-platonic thoughts about Sansa are not\nallowed in Jon\u2019s presence\u201d scene:</b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dd1-OAG9u43s\"><iframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/d1-OAG9u43s?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></figure><p>The obvious thing that this scene and the Goodfellas scene have in\ncommon is the dialogue. So let\u2019s talk about that. You all know how attached I\nam to my dialogue: </p><blockquote><p>Henry: I swear on my fucking mother, if you touch her again, you\u2019re\ndead!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Jon: Touch my sister and I\u2019ll kill you myself.</p></blockquote><p>Now, Henry is a little more verbose and he does take his own mother\u2019s\nname in vain but you know \u2026 he\u2019s half Irish and half Italian. It sort of comes\nwith the territory. But the message is clear: Touch Karen/Sansa and Henry/Jon\nwill kill you. </p><p>This phrase of: touch \u2026 and I\u2019ll kill you is used a great deal in\ndialogue for both visual and written storytelling but the important common\nthread here is the sexual context in which they are both used. </p><p>Bruce, Karen\u2019s neighbor, is beaten up by Henry because he tried to rape\nKaren. So \u201ctouch\u201d in that context is unquestioningly sexual in nature. </p><p>The Jon/LF is even more loaded because Littlefinger hasn\u2019t actually done\nanything as terrible to Sansa. Sure, his longing stares, double-entendres and creepy\nkisses are more than a little problematic, but they\u2019re not in the same league\nas what Bruce did to Karen. And yet, just the thought that Littlefinger might\napproach Sansa in that way and that he might touch her in a sexual manner,\ndrives Jon mad. </p><p>Also, as others have mentioned, Littlefinger prods and twists Jon for\nquite some time until he snaps. He talks about his father\u2019s bones, his love for\nhis father\u2019s wife and even brings up Catelyn\u2019s dislike for him, something that\nprobably bothers Jon even more than being called a bastard. And yet, even\nthough it\u2019s clear that Jon doesn\u2019t like LF, he still manages to keep his\nemotions in check.</p><p>The moment he starts losing it this: </p><blockquote><p>Littlefinger: If it weren\u2019t for me, you would have been slaughtered on\nthat battlefield. </p></blockquote><p>Now, people simply take it for granted that Jon dislikes Littlefinger\nbecause of what LF has done to his family. But Jon doesn\u2019t know most of what LF\nhas done. He actually doesn\u2019t know much of anything about him. Except this: </p><blockquote><p>Jon: You told me he sold you to the Boltons. </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sansa: He did. </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Jon: Do you trust him?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sansa: Only a fool would trust Littlefinger. </p></blockquote><p>So his sole reason for disliking this man is because of what he did to\nSansa. I would suggest that LF bringing up the Battle of the Bastards is yet\nanother reminder for Jon that she had to bring this man there in order to save\nhim. </p><p>But then LF, in his desire to find what moves his enemy, ups the ante and boy,\ndoes he find out what moves Jon Snow: </p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/95720ea905645b4dcaf912f1f68f6902/tumblr_inline_pf5zd6u1OS1ufeb46_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fe61fdd9b1aecf048adca1d385d1a7a6/tumblr_inline_pf5zdiTjDH1ufeb46_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c7d30f3c44480f3c925e06edd84f35e2/tumblr_inline_pf5zdspMyx1ufeb46_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"></figure><p>And this where that feeling of familiarity strikes me again.

No one does crazy, out of my mind\npsychopathy quite like good ol\u2019 Ray. </i></p><p>The last thing we need to address is the reason why this scene is even\nincluded. Unlike the mirror scene in season 1 where Ned chocked LF, where the\nresolution was LF\u2019s betrayal, there is no direct pay-off to this scene and\nthere never will be. LF is dead and his downfall has nothing to do with Jon. </p><p>As <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2mI02eDjTFrdK0dolpd95g\">@kitten1618x</a>\u00a0pointed out in\nher message, it can\u2019t be to show us that Jon is\nprotective of Sansa. That was already established in season 6. We\u2019ve seen him\nbeat Ramsay to a pulp and we\u2019ve also been given this gem: </p><blockquote><p>Jon: I will\nnever let him touch you again. I\u2019ll protect you. I promise!</p></blockquote><p>We\u2019re also going\nto be given a fresh dose of that in his scene with Tyrion. </p><p>There\u2019s just so\nmuch of the \u201cJon is an overprotective older brother who protects his totally\nplatonic but in need of protection sister\u201d shtick we can watch before we start\nquestioning exactly why Jon is so invested in who \u201ctouches\u201d Sansa. </p><p>I would argue that,\nconsidering basic scriptwriting structure as well as the pattern that is\nestablished between Jon and the men in Sansa\u2019s life, the pay-off to the Jon/LF\nscene will come in season 8 and it will have nothing to do with LF and\neverything to do with the Jon/Sansa dynamic. </p><p><i>PS: I call dibs on red for the wedding.

Now we know that if you push him hard enough,\nyou\u2019ll find the monster hidden beneath. The fact that it\u2019s Sansa that sparks this\nrevelation, just as Karen does for Henry, is just icing on the cake, really. </p><p>The other intriguing thing is that both these scenes end with a\nrelationship set-up between Henry and Karen, as well as Jon and Sansa. </p><p>In Goodfellas, this is a patently negative and foreboding event. Henry\nand Karen have been established as the young, attractive and in love couple,\nstrolling around town and going to the Copacabana for drinks, wearing the\nlatest fashions. But in this scene Henry hands her the gun he\u2019s just used to\nbash a man\u2019s face in and asks her to hide it. When she accepts, she becomes his\naccomplice.

So let\u2019s talk about that. You all know how attached I\nam to my dialogue: </p><blockquote><p>Henry: I swear on my fucking mother, if you touch her again, you\u2019re\ndead!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Jon: Touch my sister and I\u2019ll kill you myself.</p></blockquote><p>Now, Henry is a little more verbose and he does take his own mother\u2019s\nname in vain but you know \u2026 he\u2019s half Irish and half Italian. It sort of comes\nwith the territory. But the message is clear: Touch Karen/Sansa and Henry/Jon\nwill kill you. </p><p>This phrase of: touch \u2026 and I\u2019ll kill you is used a great deal in\ndialogue for both visual and written storytelling but the important common\nthread here is the sexual context in which they are both used. </p><p>Bruce, Karen\u2019s neighbor, is beaten up by Henry because he tried to rape\nKaren. So \u201ctouch\u201d in that context is unquestioningly sexual in nature. </p><p>The Jon/LF is even more loaded because Littlefinger hasn\u2019t actually done\nanything as terrible to Sansa. Sure, his longing stares, double-entendres and creepy\nkisses are more than a little problematic, but they\u2019re not in the same league\nas what Bruce did to Karen. And yet, just the thought that Littlefinger might\napproach Sansa in that way and that he might touch her in a sexual manner,\ndrives Jon mad. </p><p>Also, as others have mentioned, Littlefinger prods and twists Jon for\nquite some time until he snaps. He talks about his father\u2019s bones, his love for\nhis father\u2019s wife and even brings up Catelyn\u2019s dislike for him, something that\nprobably bothers Jon even more than being called a bastard. And yet, even\nthough it\u2019s clear that Jon doesn\u2019t like LF, he still manages to keep his\nemotions in check.</p><p>The moment he starts losing it this: </p><blockquote><p>Littlefinger: If it weren\u2019t for me, you would have been slaughtered on\nthat battlefield. </p></blockquote><p>Now, people simply take it for granted that Jon dislikes Littlefinger\nbecause of what LF has done to his family. But Jon doesn\u2019t know most of what LF\nhas done. He actually doesn\u2019t know much of anything about him. Except this: </p><blockquote><p>Jon: You told me he sold you to the Boltons. </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sansa: He did. </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Jon: Do you trust him?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sansa: Only a fool would trust Littlefinger. </p></blockquote><p>So his sole reason for disliking this man is because of what he did to\nSansa. I would suggest that LF bringing up the Battle of the Bastards is yet\nanother reminder for Jon that she had to bring this man there in order to save\nhim. </p><p>But then LF, in his desire to find what moves his enemy, ups the ante and boy,\ndoes he find out what moves Jon Snow: </p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/95720ea905645b4dcaf912f1f68f6902/tumblr_inline_pf5zd6u1OS1ufeb46_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fe61fdd9b1aecf048adca1d385d1a7a6/tumblr_inline_pf5zdiTjDH1ufeb46_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c7d30f3c44480f3c925e06edd84f35e2/tumblr_inline_pf5zdspMyx1ufeb46_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"></figure><p>And this where that feeling of familiarity strikes me again.

No one does crazy, out of my mind\npsychopathy quite like good ol\u2019 Ray. </i></p><p>The last thing we need to address is the reason why this scene is even\nincluded. Unlike the mirror scene in season 1 where Ned chocked LF, where the\nresolution was LF\u2019s betrayal, there is no direct pay-off to this scene and\nthere never will be. LF is dead and his downfall has nothing to do with Jon. </p><p>As <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2mI02eDjTFrdK0dolpd95g\">@kitten1618x</a>\u00a0pointed out in\nher message, it can\u2019t be to show us that Jon is\nprotective of Sansa. That was already established in season 6. We\u2019ve seen him\nbeat Ramsay to a pulp and we\u2019ve also been given this gem: </p><blockquote><p>Jon: I will\nnever let him touch you again. I\u2019ll protect you. I promise!</p></blockquote><p>We\u2019re also going\nto be given a fresh dose of that in his scene with Tyrion. </p><p>There\u2019s just so\nmuch of the \u201cJon is an overprotective older brother who protects his totally\nplatonic but in need of protection sister\u201d shtick we can watch before we start\nquestioning exactly why Jon is so invested in who \u201ctouches\u201d Sansa. </p><p>I would argue that,\nconsidering basic scriptwriting structure as well as the pattern that is\nestablished between Jon and the men in Sansa\u2019s life, the pay-off to the Jon/LF\nscene will come in season 8 and it will have nothing to do with LF and\neverything to do with the Jon/Sansa dynamic. </p><p><i>PS: I call dibs on red for the wedding.

                "content": "<p><i>*this meta includes graphic\ndepictions of violence.

The way Jon walks over to Ramsay,\nstone faced, murderous anger bubbling beneath the surface, the way his face\ntwitches when LF says he loves Sansa as he loved Catelyn &hellip; I was struck every\ntime by just how certain I was that I had seen this before somewhere and how\nromantic motivation popped into my head every single time I watched them.</p><p>And then, one fine day, it finally dawned on me.

I would suggest that LF bringing up the Battle of the Bastards is yet\nanother reminder for Jon that she had to bring this man there in order to save\nhim. </p><p>But then LF, in his desire to find what moves his enemy, ups the ante and boy,\ndoes he find out what moves Jon Snow: </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/95720ea905645b4dcaf912f1f68f6902/tumblr_inline_pf5zd6u1OS1ufeb46_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fe61fdd9b1aecf048adca1d385d1a7a6/tumblr_inline_pf5zdiTjDH1ufeb46_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c7d30f3c44480f3c925e06edd84f35e2/tumblr_inline_pf5zdspMyx1ufeb46_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>And this where that feeling of familiarity strikes me again.

No one does crazy, out of my mind\npsychopathy quite like good ol&rsquo; Ray. </i></p><p>The last thing we need to address is the reason why this scene is even\nincluded. Unlike the mirror scene in season 1 where Ned chocked LF, where the\nresolution was LF&rsquo;s betrayal, there is no direct pay-off to this scene and\nthere never will be. LF is dead and his downfall has nothing to do with Jon. </p><p>As <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2mI02eDjTFrdK0dolpd95g\">@kitten1618x</a>&nbsp;pointed out in\nher message, it can&rsquo;t be to show us that Jon is\nprotective of Sansa. That was already established in season 6. We&rsquo;ve seen him\nbeat Ramsay to a pulp and we&rsquo;ve also been given this gem: </p><blockquote><p>Jon: I will\nnever let him touch you again. I&rsquo;ll protect you. I promise!</p></blockquote><p>We&rsquo;re also going\nto be given a fresh dose of that in his scene with Tyrion. </p><p>There&rsquo;s just so\nmuch of the &ldquo;Jon is an overprotective older brother who protects his totally\nplatonic but in need of protection sister&rdquo; shtick we can watch before we start\nquestioning exactly why Jon is so invested in who &ldquo;touches&rdquo; Sansa. </p><p>I would argue that,\nconsidering basic scriptwriting structure as well as the pattern that is\nestablished between Jon and the men in Sansa&rsquo;s life, the pay-off to the Jon/LF\nscene will come in season 8 and it will have nothing to do with LF and\neverything to do with the Jon/Sansa dynamic. </p><p><i>PS: I call dibs on red for the wedding. It&rsquo;s my\nfavorite color, you guys! You have to give me that! </i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>* none of the GOT gifs belong to me. </p>",

I&rsquo;ve been pretty\nbusy the past few weeks so I didn&rsquo;t manage to get to it earlier but &hellip; a tumblr\nalways pays her debts.</p>\n<p>Here is the\noriginal message: </p>\n<blockquote><p>I would love to hear your take on the\nrage-kitten jon scenes: especially the one in the crypts, as it really did\nnothing to further the narrative if Jon is just a &ldquo;protective big bro&rdquo; (the\naudience already knows this) and the beach scene with Theon.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve already discussed the Theon scene in my &ldquo;<a href=\"https://fortunatelylori.tumblr.com/post/177459193506/why-the-jondany-romance-doesnt-work-part-4\">Why the romance between Jon/D*ny doesn&rsquo;t work</a>&rdquo; series so this time around we will be talking about the\ncrypt scene between Jon and Littlefinger. </p>\n<p>However, in addition to that, we will also be taking a trip down memory\nlane to that most satisfying and heartwarming of moments in season 6 when Jon\nbeat the living crap out of Ramsay Beelzebub Bolton. </p>\n<p>That is because these two scenes are inextricably linked in my mind and\ntogether set up and support the romantic undertone that permeates all of the\nJon/Sansa scenes. </p>\n<p>Bear with me &hellip; I have receipts. </p>\n</p>",

Sometimes Robb will translate the ghosts&rsquo; words for him, and Jon always takes care of his mother&rsquo;s tomb.</p><p>He gives her winter roses.</p><p>Though close with all his siblings (yes, even Sansa), Jon&rsquo;s favorite person in the world is still Arya. He gave her her first sword; she promised, after finding Isa, that the next magic sword she uncovered would be his. She taught him to play the harp (which nearly gave poor Ned a heart attack when he learned how good he was); he wrote her a song. They&rsquo;re two peas in a pod, and they love each other very much.</p><p>In canon, Jon Connington dyed Young Griff&rsquo;s hair blue to make his eyes look less purple. In this AU, Ned and Cat dress their nephew in gray shirts to make his eyes look less indigo. They also have to give him hair dye. (Maester Luwin, who makes the dye, always assumed it went to Ned&hellip; until Ned&rsquo;s hair started graying and he realized that it had to be for someone else. He is confused and slightly suspicious.) As a child, Jon always assumed that the gunk he had to rub into his hair was some kind of preventative treatment for lice. He knows better now. Thankfully Jon still has the long face and somber features of the Starks, or the disguise would never work.</p><p>Jon&rsquo;s direwolf is Ghost, the second-oldest of Frost and Blizzard&rsquo;s pups. He eventually managed to hatch his dragon egg, though it was a badly-timed accident. The hatchling&rsquo;s name is Heartwing, and he intends to smuggle her to Greywater Watch as soon as Robert Baratheon&rsquo;s host leaves Winterfell.</p><p>(Considering what happens while they&rsquo;re there, he&rsquo;s starting to wonder if they&rsquo;ll ever leave.)</p><p>Jon is aware that Bloodraven wants him on the Iron Throne. He mostly tries to ignore this fact. Still, he knows that if things go badly, he might not have a choice.</p><p>If things go badly, he will do everything in his power to be a king.</p></p>",
