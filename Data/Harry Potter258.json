        "body": "<p>So Albus coming out to Harry is finally here. I got sidetracked over the Summer but I\u2019ve finally got this completed. <br/></p><hr><p>Albus\nPotter had stood outside the door to his Father\u2019s study for almost ten minutes,\nhis stomach feeling as if it had been tied up in knots and that he had lost the\nuse of his arms. Why couldn\u2019t he knock on the door? All of his courage seemed\nto have failed him at the moment. </p>\n\n<p>Although\nhis relationship with Harry had greatly improved, this was his big test. He had\nto tell Harry; He owed it to Scorpius to tell Harry about their relationship. </p>\n\n<p>Scorpius.\nThe mere thought of Albus\u2019s boyfriend calmed Albus down considerably. If\nScorpius were here, he would tell Albus that he was being silly worrying about\nHarry\u2019s reaction and would give him a Pepper Imp and a kiss on the cheek good\nluck. Albus couldn\u2019t help grinning at the thought. </p>\n\n<p>During\nthe course of their relationship, Scorpius had helped Albus grow more confident\nin himself. Scorpius\u2019s constant praise had helped Albus considerably in his\nstudies and had helped him grow as a person; He was more comfortable being in\nhis own skin and the summer days he had spent with Scorpius cuddled up together\nby the beech tree by the Hogwarts Lake had been the happiest of his life. <br/></p><!-- more -->\n\n<p>It\nwas as if all his worries went away, being with Scorpius. Albus loved him so\nmuch and he hoped with all his heart that his family would accept Scorpius as\nhis boyfriend. </p>\n\n<p>Lily\nhad already accepted Scorpius and he hoped that the rest of his family would.\nHe was sure that Ginny would accept Scorpius, but Albus was worried about\nHarry. </p>\n\n<p>But\nAlbus knew that the longer he stood there at the door, the longer he would lose\nhis nerve. Picturing Scorpius\u2019s handsome face and his soft grey eyes that made\nAlbus\u2019s stomach fill with butterflies, he knocked on the Study door. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cCome\nin,\u201d said Harry\u2019s tired voice. </p>\n\n<p>It\ntook everything for Albus to turn the handle and push the door open. </p>\n\n<p>Harry\nwas sitting at his cluttered desk, looking very tired and very stressed as he\npored over a huge stack at parchment. At the sight of Albus however, Harry\u2019s\nface split into a very wide grin. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cAlbus,\u201d\nHarry said warmly. \u201cIt\u2019s late. What are you doing up? Are you alright?\u201d </p>\n\n<p>\u201cHi\nDad,\u201d Albus smiled. \u00a0\u201cAm I disturbing you?\u201d He asked uncertainly. He\ndidn\u2019t want to interrupt Harry from any important Ministry work. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cOf\ncourse not,\u201d Harry said, shoving aside the large stack of parchment. \u201cI can\ntalk to you. Come in.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>Albus\ngingerly set foot into Harry\u2019s study, his heart pounding in trepidation as he\nreached Harry\u2019s desk. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cSit\ndown,\u201d Harry said, pointing to the rickety chair in front of his desk. Albus\nsat down nervously, looking at his Dad who looked exhausted; There were dark\npatches around his eyes and Albus was quite sure that Harry was struggling to\nstay awake. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cHave\nyou got Ministry work coming out of your ears again, Dad?\u201d Albus asked,\nattempting to grin but the muscles in his mouth were too stiff. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve\nbeen filling in the court papers for those Lower Flagley burglars,\u201d Harry said.\n\u201cThey\u2019re due in next week, but I\u2019ve been tied down doing other stuff. I\u2019ve\npretty much finished them and I was just going to pack up. Are you alright? You\nlook like you\u2019ve got something on your mind.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Albus\ntensed at the idea of telling Harry now. It was all too soon. He thought he\nwould have more time to steel himself. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWould\nyou like a nightcap?\u201d Harry asked suddenly, jerking Albus out of his thoughts.\n\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\u201cA\nwhat?\u201d Albus frowned. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cA\nnightcap,\u201d Harry repeated. \u201cI\u2019ve got some Firewhisky if you- \u201c</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOkay\nthen,\u201d Albus said, hoping that a little bit of courage would help him here. </p>\n\n<p>Harry\ngot up, stretched and made his way to the rickety cabinet where he began\npouring them both a small amount of Firewhisky. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cHere,\u201d\nHarry said, handing Albus his glass and sitting back down. \u201cTake it steady and\ndon&rsquo;t drink it all at once. So, what do you want to talk to me about?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Albus\ntook a small sip of Firewhisky and made a face as it burned the back of his\nthroat and a wonderful feeling happened; it was as if all his fears melted\naway.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m\ndating Scorpius Malfoy,\u201d He said, his voice slightly louder than usual.\nSurprise flickered in Harry\u2019s eyes, but his face was impassive and Albus\u2019s\nnewfound courage seemed to flicker away and he looked moodily down at his\nglass. The seconds lengthened and Harry was still quiet and impassive and Albus\nwas starting to regret telling him. \u00a0 </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s\nbrilliant news,\u201d Harry said, breaking the silence. Albus jerked his head up in\nsurprise and was shocked to see Harry was smiling. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d\nAlbus asked, not daring to believe what he was hearing. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cOf\ncourse,\u201d Harry said, his smile turning into a grin. \u201cYou two are brilliant\ntogether and I think Scorpius is perfect for you.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSo,\nyou\u2019re happy for me?\u201d Albus pressed him, not daring to believe what he was\nhearing. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cAlbus,\nI\u2019m happy as long as you\u2019re happy,\u201d Harry said, taking a sip of Firewhisky. \u201cIf\nyou\u2019re worried about what I think about you dating Scorpius, then don\u2019t be. I\ntrust Scorpius and I think he will be brilliant for you. You\u2019re always laughing\ntogether.\u00a0 When you got off the train, I saw that you looked a lot\nhappier, a lot less anxious. That\u2019s because of Scorpius, isn\u2019t it? You\u2019re\nalways a lot calmer around Scorpius.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d\nAlbus said, a soppy grin appearing on his face which he quickly got rid of.\nHarry nodded approvingly. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\nthought so,\u201d Harry said. \u201cTo be honest, I thought something was going on\nbetween you two.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Albus\u2019s\nmouth dropped open in shock. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d\nHe gasped. \u201cDad, how did you even know? We\u2019ve both tried to keep it a secret.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m\nnot as clueless as your Mother and Aunt Hermione say I am,\u201d Harry smiled, his\neyes twinkling. \u201cI just prefer to leave the dating side of things to your Mum.\nShe\u2019s a lot better when it comes to feelings. Anyway, you\u2019re both pretty\nobvious. You tend to look at each other a lot more than usual and you both\nstand a lot closer than normal best friends. I\u2019ve had my suspicions for a\nwhile, but I didn\u2019t like to say anything. I thought that it would be best to\nlet you two get on with sorting this out yourselves.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Albus\nwas speechless; he had never expected his Dad to guess about his relationship\nwith Scorpius. He had thought he had been subtle about hiding it, but apparently,\nhe wasn\u2019t. Was he really this obvious? Did anyone else guess about their\nrelationship? He was certain that if Harry had guessed, then Ginny certainly\nknew.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cBeing\nable to read people is an important skill for an Auror, Albus,\u201d Harry said,\nsurveying Albus who had a sneaking suspicion that Harry had somehow read his\nmind. \u201cYou looked quite nervous when you came in. Were you worried about\ntelling me this?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d\nAlbus nodded. \u201cI just didn\u2019t know how you would react, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Something\nflickered across Harry\u2019s eyes and his expression became unreadable. Albus had\nthe suspicion that Harry was feeling guilty. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou\nknow you can tell me anything,\u201d Harry said finally, a soft edge to his voice. \u201cDon\u2019t\nbe afraid to talk to me.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\nknow I can,\u201d Albus said slowly. \u201cBut it was mostly to do with you know- The boy\nthing. I didn\u2019t know what you would think about me going out with a boy.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\ndon\u2019t care about that,\u201d Harry said gently. \u201cI think it\u2019s great that there is\nmore love in this world.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>\u201cSo\ndo I,\u201d Albus said, another soppy grin appearing on his face no doubt due to the\nFirewhisky he was drinking. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\nremember being nervous when your Mother and I told your Grandparents and Uncles\nabout our relationship,\u201d Harry said. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d\nAlbus asked, feeling shocked. \u201cBut they loved you. Why would you be nervous?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\nwas Ron\u2019s friend before I was your Mother\u2019s Boyfriend,\u201d Harry said with a\nsmile. \u201cThankfully your Grandparents were over the moon about it.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDid\nany of Mum\u2019s brothers threaten to hex you?\u201d Albus asked with a sly smile. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d\nHarry laughed. \u201cBut it was a bit of a shock for your Uncle Percy. He hadn\u2019t\nseen your Mother for a while and seeing her with a Boyfriend was a lot to take\nin.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAnd\nthe fact that you\u2019re Harry Potter,\u201d Albus said, grinning slyly. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThat\ntoo,\u201d Harry smiled. \u201cHe was alright about it in the end.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDo\nyou think the family would be alright with me and Scorpius?\u201d Albus asked,\nvoicing his worries for the first time. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe\nall want you to be happy, Albus,\u201d Harry said. \u201cYou\u2019re happy with Scorpius, so I\nimagine that the family would be very happy for you.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>Albus\ngrinned as a feeling of great relief washed over him. He felt a great burden\nlift from his shoulders making him feel light and easy. He had never expected\nthings to turn out this good, in fact he was expecting the worst. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re\nlooking a lot happier already,\u201d Harry said, smiling at the way Albus was\ngrinning. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cYeah,\nI am,\u201d Albus said. \u201cThanks for accepting me, Dad. For accepting me and\nScorpius. It means a lot to us.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m\nglad you\u2019ve found someone like Scorpius,\u201d Harry said, his eyes oddly bright\nbehind his glasses. \u201cSomeone who loves you and who will take good care of you.\nYour Mother did that with me after the war.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cShe\ndid?\u201d Albus asked, feeling curious. Harry nodded, that familiar faraway look in\nhis eye. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf\nit weren\u2019t for your Mum, I\u2019m sure I would\u2019ve fallen to pieces,\u201d He said,\nsmiling. \u201cShe kept me sane after the Battle of Hogwarts. She kept me going. I\nwas full of so much guilt over losing so many during the battle. Remus Lupin,\nTonks, your Uncle Fred, the list goes on. But your Mum picked me up, dusted me\noff and gave me a reason to get out of bed each day. I don\u2019t know where I\u2019d be\nwithout her, to be honest.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s\nhow I feel about Scorpius,\u201d Albus said, feeling surprised. \u201cEspecially the\ngetting out of bed bit. He always gave me a reason to do better for myself and\nsince I\u2019ve been with him, I\u2019ve found myself doing a lot better in classes.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe\npower of love really is incredible sometimes,\u201d Harry said, looking pensive.\n\u201cDumbledore kept telling me how important it was and there were times that I\nused to scoff at him for it, but after everything I went through I believe that\nits importance is more relevant than ever.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nhard to imagine living without love,\u201d Albus said thoughtfully. \u201cYou\u2019d probably\nhave a bleak existence.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nwhat makes us human,\u201d Harry said. \u201cLook at Voldemort, look at how he had no\ncompassion for anyone, he never knew friendship or love and I think that that\nis something to be pitied.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\nwould\u2019ve been nothing without Scorpius,\u201d Albus said quietly. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cAnd\nI would\u2019ve been nothing without Ron, Hermione and your Mother,\u201d Harry said,\njust as quiet. </p>\n\n<p>Both\nof them lapsed into a comfortable silence lost in their own thoughts. Albus\ndidn\u2019t know how long they sat there but Harry\u2019s clock chimed, jerking them out\nof their thoughts. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWell,\nlook at the time,\u201d Harry said, draining his glass and pulling a funny face. \u201cWe\nshould be in bed. Come on.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>Harry\ngot up and put his glass away as Albus pinched his nose and drained what little\nFirewhisky there was at the bottom of it. It seared his throat going down and\nhe pulled a face as it did so. Harry cleared up Albus\u2019s glass and Albus got up\nto leave, feeling as if he could float on air. </p>\n\n<p>He\nfelt Harry\u2019s hand on his shoulder and he turned around to look at his Dad who\nhad a peculiar look in his eye. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cBefore\nwe go to bed, do you fancy a Hot Chocolate?\u201d Harry asked. \u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to\nmake one all day and since you told me about you and Scorpius, maybe we could.\nErr\u2026 Celebrate together?\u201d </p>\n\n<p>\u201cOkay,\nthen,\u201d Albus said, feeling incredibly touched.

Albus loved him so\nmuch and he hoped with all his heart that his family would accept Scorpius as\nhis boyfriend. </p>\n\n<p>Lily\nhad already accepted Scorpius and he hoped that the rest of his family would.\nHe was sure that Ginny would accept Scorpius, but Albus was worried about\nHarry. </p>\n\n<p>But\nAlbus knew that the longer he stood there at the door, the longer he would lose\nhis nerve. Picturing Scorpius\u2019s handsome face and his soft grey eyes that made\nAlbus\u2019s stomach fill with butterflies, he knocked on the Study door. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cCome\nin,\u201d said Harry\u2019s tired voice. </p>\n\n<p>It\ntook everything for Albus to turn the handle and push the door open. </p>\n\n<p>Harry\nwas sitting at his cluttered desk, looking very tired and very stressed as he\npored over a huge stack at parchment. At the sight of Albus however, Harry\u2019s\nface split into a very wide grin. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cAlbus,\u201d\nHarry said warmly. \u201cIt\u2019s late. What are you doing up? Are you alright?\u201d </p>\n\n<p>\u201cHi\nDad,\u201d Albus smiled. \u00a0\u201cAm I disturbing you?\u201d He asked uncertainly. He\ndidn\u2019t want to interrupt Harry from any important Ministry work. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cOf\ncourse not,\u201d Harry said, shoving aside the large stack of parchment. \u201cI can\ntalk to you. Come in.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>Albus\ngingerly set foot into Harry\u2019s study, his heart pounding in trepidation as he\nreached Harry\u2019s desk. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cSit\ndown,\u201d Harry said, pointing to the rickety chair in front of his desk. Albus\nsat down nervously, looking at his Dad who looked exhausted; There were dark\npatches around his eyes and Albus was quite sure that Harry was struggling to\nstay awake. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cHave\nyou got Ministry work coming out of your ears again, Dad?\u201d Albus asked,\nattempting to grin but the muscles in his mouth were too stiff. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve\nbeen filling in the court papers for those Lower Flagley burglars,\u201d Harry said.\n\u201cThey\u2019re due in next week, but I\u2019ve been tied down doing other stuff. I\u2019ve\npretty much finished them and I was just going to pack up. Are you alright? You\nlook like you\u2019ve got something on your mind.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Albus\ntensed at the idea of telling Harry now. It was all too soon. He thought he\nwould have more time to steel himself. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWould\nyou like a nightcap?\u201d Harry asked suddenly, jerking Albus out of his thoughts.\n\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\u201cA\nwhat?\u201d Albus frowned. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cA\nnightcap,\u201d Harry repeated. \u201cI\u2019ve got some Firewhisky if you- \u201c</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOkay\nthen,\u201d Albus said, hoping that a little bit of courage would help him here. </p>\n\n<p>Harry\ngot up, stretched and made his way to the rickety cabinet where he began\npouring them both a small amount of Firewhisky. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cHere,\u201d\nHarry said, handing Albus his glass and sitting back down. \u201cTake it steady and\ndon\u2019t drink it all at once. So, what do you want to talk to me about?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Albus\ntook a small sip of Firewhisky and made a face as it burned the back of his\nthroat and a wonderful feeling happened; it was as if all his fears melted\naway.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m\ndating Scorpius Malfoy,\u201d He said, his voice slightly louder than usual.\nSurprise flickered in Harry\u2019s eyes, but his face was impassive and Albus\u2019s\nnewfound courage seemed to flicker away and he looked moodily down at his\nglass. The seconds lengthened and Harry was still quiet and impassive and Albus\nwas starting to regret telling him. \u00a0 </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s\nbrilliant news,\u201d Harry said, breaking the silence. Albus jerked his head up in\nsurprise and was shocked to see Harry was smiling. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d\nAlbus asked, not daring to believe what he was hearing. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cOf\ncourse,\u201d Harry said, his smile turning into a grin. \u201cYou two are brilliant\ntogether and I think Scorpius is perfect for you.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSo,\nyou\u2019re happy for me?\u201d Albus pressed him, not daring to believe what he was\nhearing. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cAlbus,\nI\u2019m happy as long as you\u2019re happy,\u201d Harry said, taking a sip of Firewhisky. \u201cIf\nyou\u2019re worried about what I think about you dating Scorpius, then don\u2019t be. I\ntrust Scorpius and I think he will be brilliant for you. You\u2019re always laughing\ntogether.\u00a0 When you got off the train, I saw that you looked a lot\nhappier, a lot less anxious. That\u2019s because of Scorpius, isn\u2019t it? You\u2019re\nalways a lot calmer around Scorpius.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d\nAlbus said, a soppy grin appearing on his face which he quickly got rid of.\nHarry nodded approvingly. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\nthought so,\u201d Harry said. \u201cTo be honest, I thought something was going on\nbetween you two.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Albus\u2019s\nmouth dropped open in shock. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d\nHe gasped. \u201cDad, how did you even know? We\u2019ve both tried to keep it a secret.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m\nnot as clueless as your Mother and Aunt Hermione say I am,\u201d Harry smiled, his\neyes twinkling. \u201cI just prefer to leave the dating side of things to your Mum.\nShe\u2019s a lot better when it comes to feelings. Anyway, you\u2019re both pretty\nobvious. You tend to look at each other a lot more than usual and you both\nstand a lot closer than normal best friends. I\u2019ve had my suspicions for a\nwhile, but I didn\u2019t like to say anything. I thought that it would be best to\nlet you two get on with sorting this out yourselves.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Albus\nwas speechless; he had never expected his Dad to guess about his relationship\nwith Scorpius. He had thought he had been subtle about hiding it, but apparently,\nhe wasn\u2019t. Was he really this obvious? Did anyone else guess about their\nrelationship? He was certain that if Harry had guessed, then Ginny certainly\nknew.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cBeing\nable to read people is an important skill for an Auror, Albus,\u201d Harry said,\nsurveying Albus who had a sneaking suspicion that Harry had somehow read his\nmind. \u201cYou looked quite nervous when you came in. Were you worried about\ntelling me this?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d\nAlbus nodded. \u201cI just didn\u2019t know how you would react, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Something\nflickered across Harry\u2019s eyes and his expression became unreadable. Albus had\nthe suspicion that Harry was feeling guilty. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou\nknow you can tell me anything,\u201d Harry said finally, a soft edge to his voice. \u201cDon\u2019t\nbe afraid to talk to me.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\nknow I can,\u201d Albus said slowly. \u201cBut it was mostly to do with you know- The boy\nthing. I didn\u2019t know what you would think about me going out with a boy.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\ndon\u2019t care about that,\u201d Harry said gently. \u201cI think it\u2019s great that there is\nmore love in this world.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>\u201cSo\ndo I,\u201d Albus said, another soppy grin appearing on his face no doubt due to the\nFirewhisky he was drinking. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\nremember being nervous when your Mother and I told your Grandparents and Uncles\nabout our relationship,\u201d Harry said. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d\nAlbus asked, feeling shocked. \u201cBut they loved you. Why would you be nervous?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\nwas Ron\u2019s friend before I was your Mother\u2019s Boyfriend,\u201d Harry said with a\nsmile. \u201cThankfully your Grandparents were over the moon about it.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDid\nany of Mum\u2019s brothers threaten to hex you?\u201d Albus asked with a sly smile. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d\nHarry laughed. \u201cBut it was a bit of a shock for your Uncle Percy. He hadn\u2019t\nseen your Mother for a while and seeing her with a Boyfriend was a lot to take\nin.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAnd\nthe fact that you\u2019re Harry Potter,\u201d Albus said, grinning slyly. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThat\ntoo,\u201d Harry smiled. \u201cHe was alright about it in the end.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDo\nyou think the family would be alright with me and Scorpius?\u201d Albus asked,\nvoicing his worries for the first time. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe\nall want you to be happy, Albus,\u201d Harry said. \u201cYou\u2019re happy with Scorpius, so I\nimagine that the family would be very happy for you.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>Albus\ngrinned as a feeling of great relief washed over him. He felt a great burden\nlift from his shoulders making him feel light and easy. He had never expected\nthings to turn out this good, in fact he was expecting the worst. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re\nlooking a lot happier already,\u201d Harry said, smiling at the way Albus was\ngrinning. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cYeah,\nI am,\u201d Albus said. \u201cThanks for accepting me, Dad. For accepting me and\nScorpius. It means a lot to us.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m\nglad you\u2019ve found someone like Scorpius,\u201d Harry said, his eyes oddly bright\nbehind his glasses. \u201cSomeone who loves you and who will take good care of you.\nYour Mother did that with me after the war.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cShe\ndid?\u201d Albus asked, feeling curious. Harry nodded, that familiar faraway look in\nhis eye. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf\nit weren\u2019t for your Mum, I\u2019m sure I would\u2019ve fallen to pieces,\u201d He said,\nsmiling. \u201cShe kept me sane after the Battle of Hogwarts. She kept me going. I\nwas full of so much guilt over losing so many during the battle. Remus Lupin,\nTonks, your Uncle Fred, the list goes on.

Albus\ndidn\u2019t know how long they sat there but Harry\u2019s clock chimed, jerking them out\nof their thoughts. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWell,\nlook at the time,\u201d Harry said, draining his glass and pulling a funny face. \u201cWe\nshould be in bed.

If\nScorpius were here, he would tell Albus that he was being silly worrying about\nHarry\u2019s reaction and would give him a Pepper Imp and a kiss on the cheek good\nluck.

Picturing Scorpius\u2019s handsome face and his soft grey eyes that made\nAlbus\u2019s stomach fill with butterflies, he knocked on the Study door. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cCome\nin,\u201d said Harry\u2019s tired voice. </p>\n\n<p>It\ntook everything for Albus to turn the handle and push the door open. </p>\n\n<p>Harry\nwas sitting at his cluttered desk, looking very tired and very stressed as he\npored over a huge stack at parchment. At the sight of Albus however, Harry\u2019s\nface split into a very wide grin. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cAlbus,\u201d\nHarry said warmly. \u201cIt\u2019s late. What are you doing up? Are you alright?\u201d </p>\n\n<p>\u201cHi\nDad,\u201d Albus smiled. \u00a0\u201cAm I disturbing you?\u201d He asked uncertainly. He\ndidn\u2019t want to interrupt Harry from any important Ministry work. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cOf\ncourse not,\u201d Harry said, shoving aside the large stack of parchment. \u201cI can\ntalk to you. Come in.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>Albus\ngingerly set foot into Harry\u2019s study, his heart pounding in trepidation as he\nreached Harry\u2019s desk. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cSit\ndown,\u201d Harry said, pointing to the rickety chair in front of his desk. Albus\nsat down nervously, looking at his Dad who looked exhausted; There were dark\npatches around his eyes and Albus was quite sure that Harry was struggling to\nstay awake. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cHave\nyou got Ministry work coming out of your ears again, Dad?\u201d Albus asked,\nattempting to grin but the muscles in his mouth were too stiff. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve\nbeen filling in the court papers for those Lower Flagley burglars,\u201d Harry said.\n\u201cThey\u2019re due in next week, but I\u2019ve been tied down doing other stuff. I\u2019ve\npretty much finished them and I was just going to pack up. Are you alright? You\nlook like you\u2019ve got something on your mind.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Albus\ntensed at the idea of telling Harry now. It was all too soon. He thought he\nwould have more time to steel himself. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWould\nyou like a nightcap?\u201d Harry asked suddenly, jerking Albus out of his thoughts.\n\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\u201cA\nwhat?\u201d Albus frowned. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cA\nnightcap,\u201d Harry repeated. \u201cI\u2019ve got some Firewhisky if you- \u201c</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOkay\nthen,\u201d Albus said, hoping that a little bit of courage would help him here. </p>\n\n<p>Harry\ngot up, stretched and made his way to the rickety cabinet where he began\npouring them both a small amount of Firewhisky. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cHere,\u201d\nHarry said, handing Albus his glass and sitting back down. \u201cTake it steady and\ndon\u2019t drink it all at once. So, what do you want to talk to me about?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Albus\ntook a small sip of Firewhisky and made a face as it burned the back of his\nthroat and a wonderful feeling happened; it was as if all his fears melted\naway.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m\ndating Scorpius Malfoy,\u201d He said, his voice slightly louder than usual.\nSurprise flickered in Harry\u2019s eyes, but his face was impassive and Albus\u2019s\nnewfound courage seemed to flicker away and he looked moodily down at his\nglass. The seconds lengthened and Harry was still quiet and impassive and Albus\nwas starting to regret telling him. \u00a0 </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s\nbrilliant news,\u201d Harry said, breaking the silence. Albus jerked his head up in\nsurprise and was shocked to see Harry was smiling. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d\nAlbus asked, not daring to believe what he was hearing. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cOf\ncourse,\u201d Harry said, his smile turning into a grin. \u201cYou two are brilliant\ntogether and I think Scorpius is perfect for you.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSo,\nyou\u2019re happy for me?\u201d Albus pressed him, not daring to believe what he was\nhearing. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cAlbus,\nI\u2019m happy as long as you\u2019re happy,\u201d Harry said, taking a sip of Firewhisky. \u201cIf\nyou\u2019re worried about what I think about you dating Scorpius, then don\u2019t be. I\ntrust Scorpius and I think he will be brilliant for you. You\u2019re always laughing\ntogether.\u00a0 When you got off the train, I saw that you looked a lot\nhappier, a lot less anxious. That\u2019s because of Scorpius, isn\u2019t it? You\u2019re\nalways a lot calmer around Scorpius.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d\nAlbus said, a soppy grin appearing on his face which he quickly got rid of.\nHarry nodded approvingly. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\nthought so,\u201d Harry said. \u201cTo be honest, I thought something was going on\nbetween you two.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Albus\u2019s\nmouth dropped open in shock. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d\nHe gasped. \u201cDad, how did you even know? We\u2019ve both tried to keep it a secret.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m\nnot as clueless as your Mother and Aunt Hermione say I am,\u201d Harry smiled, his\neyes twinkling. \u201cI just prefer to leave the dating side of things to your Mum.\nShe\u2019s a lot better when it comes to feelings. Anyway, you\u2019re both pretty\nobvious. You tend to look at each other a lot more than usual and you both\nstand a lot closer than normal best friends. I\u2019ve had my suspicions for a\nwhile, but I didn\u2019t like to say anything. I thought that it would be best to\nlet you two get on with sorting this out yourselves.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Albus\nwas speechless; he had never expected his Dad to guess about his relationship\nwith Scorpius. He had thought he had been subtle about hiding it, but apparently,\nhe wasn\u2019t. Was he really this obvious? Did anyone else guess about their\nrelationship? He was certain that if Harry had guessed, then Ginny certainly\nknew.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cBeing\nable to read people is an important skill for an Auror, Albus,\u201d Harry said,\nsurveying Albus who had a sneaking suspicion that Harry had somehow read his\nmind. \u201cYou looked quite nervous when you came in. Were you worried about\ntelling me this?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d\nAlbus nodded. \u201cI just didn\u2019t know how you would react, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Something\nflickered across Harry\u2019s eyes and his expression became unreadable. Albus had\nthe suspicion that Harry was feeling guilty. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou\nknow you can tell me anything,\u201d Harry said finally, a soft edge to his voice. \u201cDon\u2019t\nbe afraid to talk to me.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\nknow I can,\u201d Albus said slowly. \u201cBut it was mostly to do with you know- The boy\nthing. I didn\u2019t know what you would think about me going out with a boy.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\ndon\u2019t care about that,\u201d Harry said gently. \u201cI think it\u2019s great that there is\nmore love in this world.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>\u201cSo\ndo I,\u201d Albus said, another soppy grin appearing on his face no doubt due to the\nFirewhisky he was drinking. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\nremember being nervous when your Mother and I told your Grandparents and Uncles\nabout our relationship,\u201d Harry said. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d\nAlbus asked, feeling shocked. \u201cBut they loved you. Why would you be nervous?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\nwas Ron\u2019s friend before I was your Mother\u2019s Boyfriend,\u201d Harry said with a\nsmile. \u201cThankfully your Grandparents were over the moon about it.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDid\nany of Mum\u2019s brothers threaten to hex you?\u201d Albus asked with a sly smile. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d\nHarry laughed. \u201cBut it was a bit of a shock for your Uncle Percy. He hadn\u2019t\nseen your Mother for a while and seeing her with a Boyfriend was a lot to take\nin.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAnd\nthe fact that you\u2019re Harry Potter,\u201d Albus said, grinning slyly. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThat\ntoo,\u201d Harry smiled. \u201cHe was alright about it in the end.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDo\nyou think the family would be alright with me and Scorpius?\u201d Albus asked,\nvoicing his worries for the first time. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe\nall want you to be happy, Albus,\u201d Harry said. \u201cYou\u2019re happy with Scorpius, so I\nimagine that the family would be very happy for you.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>Albus\ngrinned as a feeling of great relief washed over him. He felt a great burden\nlift from his shoulders making him feel light and easy. He had never expected\nthings to turn out this good, in fact he was expecting the worst. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re\nlooking a lot happier already,\u201d Harry said, smiling at the way Albus was\ngrinning. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cYeah,\nI am,\u201d Albus said. \u201cThanks for accepting me, Dad. For accepting me and\nScorpius. It means a lot to us.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m\nglad you\u2019ve found someone like Scorpius,\u201d Harry said, his eyes oddly bright\nbehind his glasses. \u201cSomeone who loves you and who will take good care of you.\nYour Mother did that with me after the war.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cShe\ndid?\u201d Albus asked, feeling curious. Harry nodded, that familiar faraway look in\nhis eye. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf\nit weren\u2019t for your Mum, I\u2019m sure I would\u2019ve fallen to pieces,\u201d He said,\nsmiling. \u201cShe kept me sane after the Battle of Hogwarts. She kept me going. I\nwas full of so much guilt over losing so many during the battle. Remus Lupin,\nTonks, your Uncle Fred, the list goes on. But your Mum picked me up, dusted me\noff and gave me a reason to get out of bed each day. I don\u2019t know where I\u2019d be\nwithout her, to be honest.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s\nhow I feel about Scorpius,\u201d Albus said, feeling surprised. \u201cEspecially the\ngetting out of bed bit. He always gave me a reason to do better for myself and\nsince I\u2019ve been with him, I\u2019ve found myself doing a lot better in classes.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe\npower of love really is incredible sometimes,\u201d Harry said, looking pensive.\n\u201cDumbledore kept telling me how important it was and there were times that I\nused to scoff at him for it, but after everything I went through I believe that\nits importance is more relevant than ever.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nhard to imagine living without love,\u201d Albus said thoughtfully. \u201cYou\u2019d probably\nhave a bleak existence.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nwhat makes us human,\u201d Harry said. \u201cLook at Voldemort, look at how he had no\ncompassion for anyone, he never knew friendship or love and I think that that\nis something to be pitied.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\nwould\u2019ve been nothing without Scorpius,\u201d Albus said quietly. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cAnd\nI would\u2019ve been nothing without Ron, Hermione and your Mother,\u201d Harry said,\njust as quiet. </p>\n\n<p>Both\nof them lapsed into a comfortable silence lost in their own thoughts. Albus\ndidn\u2019t know how long they sat there but Harry\u2019s clock chimed, jerking them out\nof their thoughts. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWell,\nlook at the time,\u201d Harry said, draining his glass and pulling a funny face. \u201cWe\nshould be in bed. Come on.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>Harry\ngot up and put his glass away as Albus pinched his nose and drained what little\nFirewhisky there was at the bottom of it. It seared his throat going down and\nhe pulled a face as it did so. Harry cleared up Albus\u2019s glass and Albus got up\nto leave, feeling as if he could float on air. </p>\n\n<p>He\nfelt Harry\u2019s hand on his shoulder and he turned around to look at his Dad who\nhad a peculiar look in his eye. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cBefore\nwe go to bed, do you fancy a Hot Chocolate?\u201d Harry asked. \u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to\nmake one all day and since you told me about you and Scorpius, maybe we could.\nErr\u2026 Celebrate together?\u201d </p>\n\n<p>\u201cOkay,\nthen,\u201d Albus said, feeling incredibly touched. His face split into a grin. \u201cBut\nI won\u2019t tell Mum if you don\u2019t.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\nthink it\u2019s a deal,\u201d Harry said with a laugh, shaking Albus\u2019s hand. Albus pulled Harry into a hug where they stayed for a minute. <br></p><p>\u201cThanks for everything, Dad,\u201d Albus said fiercley. <br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re finally happy, Albus,\u201d Harry said, patting Albus\u2019s back. \u201cYou deserve to have someone as brilliant as Scorpius and I hope everything goes alright for you in your relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings have just got even better,\u201d Albus said pulling out of the hug. \u201cI haven\u2019t even told Mum yet. I wanted you to know first.\u201c</p><p>\u201cThank you for telling me,\u201d Harry said, his eyes shining. \u201cNow let\u2019s celebrate you and Scorpius with some Hot Chocolate.\u201d <br></p>\n\n<p>As\nthe pair of them made their way downstairs, Albus thought that this couldn\u2019t\nget any better. As they sat in the kitchen, both drinking steaming mugs of Hot\nChocolate, he realised that he was wrong. </p>",

You&rsquo;re\nalways a lot calmer around Scorpius.&rdquo; </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo;\nAlbus said, a soppy grin appearing on his face which he quickly got rid of.\nHarry nodded approvingly. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I\nthought so,&rdquo; Harry said. &ldquo;To be honest, I thought something was going on\nbetween you two.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Albus&rsquo;s\nmouth dropped open in shock. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;\nHe gasped. &ldquo;Dad, how did you even know? We&rsquo;ve both tried to keep it a secret.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m\nnot as clueless as your Mother and Aunt Hermione say I am,&rdquo; Harry smiled, his\neyes twinkling. &ldquo;I just prefer to leave the dating side of things to your Mum.\nShe&rsquo;s a lot better when it comes to feelings. Anyway, you&rsquo;re both pretty\nobvious. You tend to look at each other a lot more than usual and you both\nstand a lot closer than normal best friends. I&rsquo;ve had my suspicions for a\nwhile, but I didn&rsquo;t like to say anything. I thought that it would be best to\nlet you two get on with sorting this out yourselves.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Albus\nwas speechless; he had never expected his Dad to guess about his relationship\nwith Scorpius. He had thought he had been subtle about hiding it, but apparently,\nhe wasn&rsquo;t. Was he really this obvious? Did anyone else guess about their\nrelationship? He was certain that if Harry had guessed, then Ginny certainly\nknew.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Being\nable to read people is an important skill for an Auror, Albus,&rdquo; Harry said,\nsurveying Albus who had a sneaking suspicion that Harry had somehow read his\nmind. &ldquo;You looked quite nervous when you came in. Were you worried about\ntelling me this?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo;\nAlbus nodded. &ldquo;I just didn&rsquo;t know how you would react, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Something\nflickered across Harry&rsquo;s eyes and his expression became unreadable. Albus had\nthe suspicion that Harry was feeling guilty. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You\nknow you can tell me anything,&rdquo; Harry said finally, a soft edge to his voice. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t\nbe afraid to talk to me.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I\nknow I can,&rdquo; Albus said slowly. &ldquo;But it was mostly to do with you know- The boy\nthing. I didn&rsquo;t know what you would think about me going out with a boy.&rdquo; </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I\ndon&rsquo;t care about that,&rdquo; Harry said gently. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s great that there is\nmore love in this world.&rdquo; </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;So\ndo I,&rdquo; Albus said, another soppy grin appearing on his face no doubt due to the\nFirewhisky he was drinking. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I\nremember being nervous when your Mother and I told your Grandparents and Uncles\nabout our relationship,&rdquo; Harry said. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;\nAlbus asked, feeling shocked. &ldquo;But they loved you. Why would you be nervous?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I\nwas Ron&rsquo;s friend before I was your Mother&rsquo;s Boyfriend,&rdquo; Harry said with a\nsmile. &ldquo;Thankfully your Grandparents were over the moon about it.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Did\nany of Mum&rsquo;s brothers threaten to hex you?&rdquo; Albus asked with a sly smile. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;\nHarry laughed. &ldquo;But it was a bit of a shock for your Uncle Percy. He hadn&rsquo;t\nseen your Mother for a while and seeing her with a Boyfriend was a lot to take\nin.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;And\nthe fact that you&rsquo;re Harry Potter,&rdquo; Albus said, grinning slyly. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;That\ntoo,&rdquo; Harry smiled. &ldquo;He was alright about it in the end.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Do\nyou think the family would be alright with me and Scorpius?&rdquo; Albus asked,\nvoicing his worries for the first time. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We\nall want you to be happy, Albus,&rdquo; Harry said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re happy with Scorpius, so I\nimagine that the family would be very happy for you.&rdquo; </p>\n\n<p>Albus\ngrinned as a feeling of great relief washed over him. He felt a great burden\nlift from his shoulders making him feel light and easy. He had never expected\nthings to turn out this good, in fact he was expecting the worst. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re\nlooking a lot happier already,&rdquo; Harry said, smiling at the way Albus was\ngrinning. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah,\nI am,&rdquo; Albus said. &ldquo;Thanks for accepting me, Dad. For accepting me and\nScorpius. It means a lot to us.&rdquo; </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m\nglad you&rsquo;ve found someone like Scorpius,&rdquo; Harry said, his eyes oddly bright\nbehind his glasses. &ldquo;Someone who loves you and who will take good care of you.\nYour Mother did that with me after the war.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;She\ndid?&rdquo; Albus asked, feeling curious. Harry nodded, that familiar faraway look in\nhis eye. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;If\nit weren&rsquo;t for your Mum, I&rsquo;m sure I would&rsquo;ve fallen to pieces,&rdquo; He said,\nsmiling. &ldquo;She kept me sane after the Battle of Hogwarts. She kept me going. I\nwas full of so much guilt over losing so many during the battle. Remus Lupin,\nTonks, your Uncle Fred, the list goes on. But your Mum picked me up, dusted me\noff and gave me a reason to get out of bed each day. I don&rsquo;t know where I&rsquo;d be\nwithout her, to be honest.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s\nhow I feel about Scorpius,&rdquo; Albus said, feeling surprised. &ldquo;Especially the\ngetting out of bed bit. He always gave me a reason to do better for myself and\nsince I&rsquo;ve been with him, I&rsquo;ve found myself doing a lot better in classes.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The\npower of love really is incredible sometimes,&rdquo; Harry said, looking pensive.\n&ldquo;Dumbledore kept telling me how important it was and there were times that I\nused to scoff at him for it, but after everything I went through I believe that\nits importance is more relevant than ever.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\nhard to imagine living without love,&rdquo; Albus said thoughtfully. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d probably\nhave a bleak existence.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\nwhat makes us human,&rdquo; Harry said. &ldquo;Look at Voldemort, look at how he had no\ncompassion for anyone, he never knew friendship or love and I think that that\nis something to be pitied.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I\nwould&rsquo;ve been nothing without Scorpius,&rdquo; Albus said quietly. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;And\nI would&rsquo;ve been nothing without Ron, Hermione and your Mother,&rdquo; Harry said,\njust as quiet. </p>\n\n<p>Both\nof them lapsed into a comfortable silence lost in their own thoughts. Albus\ndidn&rsquo;t know how long they sat there but Harry&rsquo;s clock chimed, jerking them out\nof their thoughts. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Well,\nlook at the time,&rdquo; Harry said, draining his glass and pulling a funny face. &ldquo;We\nshould be in bed. Come on.&rdquo; </p>\n\n<p>Harry\ngot up and put his glass away as Albus pinched his nose and drained what little\nFirewhisky there was at the bottom of it. It seared his throat going down and\nhe pulled a face as it did so. Harry cleared up Albus&rsquo;s glass and Albus got up\nto leave, feeling as if he could float on air. </p>\n\n<p>He\nfelt Harry&rsquo;s hand on his shoulder and he turned around to look at his Dad who\nhad a peculiar look in his eye. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Before\nwe go to bed, do you fancy a Hot Chocolate?&rdquo; Harry asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been meaning to\nmake one all day and since you told me about you and Scorpius, maybe we could.\nErr&hellip; Celebrate together?&rdquo; </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Okay,\nthen,&rdquo; Albus said, feeling incredibly touched. His face split into a grin. &ldquo;But\nI won&rsquo;t tell Mum if you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I\nthink it&rsquo;s a deal,&rdquo; Harry said with a laugh, shaking Albus&rsquo;s hand. Albus pulled Harry into a hug where they stayed for a minute. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Thanks for everything, Dad,&rdquo; Albus said fiercley. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re finally happy, Albus,&rdquo; Harry said, patting Albus&rsquo;s back. &ldquo;You deserve to have someone as brilliant as Scorpius and I hope everything goes alright for you in your relationship.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Things have just got even better,&rdquo; Albus said pulling out of the hug. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t even told Mum yet. I wanted you to know first.&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you for telling me,&rdquo; Harry said, his eyes shining. &ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s celebrate you and Scorpius with some Hot Chocolate.&rdquo; <br /></p>\n\n<p>As\nthe pair of them made their way downstairs, Albus thought that this couldn&rsquo;t\nget any better. As they sat in the kitchen, both drinking steaming mugs of Hot\nChocolate, he realised that he was wrong. </p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p>So Albus coming out to Harry is finally here. I got sidetracked over the Summer but I&rsquo;ve finally got this completed. <br /></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Albus\nPotter had stood outside the door to his Father&rsquo;s study for almost ten minutes,\nhis stomach feeling as if it had been tied up in knots and that he had lost the\nuse of his arms. Why couldn&rsquo;t he knock on the door? All of his courage seemed\nto have failed him at the moment. </p>\n\n<p>Although\nhis relationship with Harry had greatly improved, this was his big test. He had\nto tell Harry; He owed it to Scorpius to tell Harry about their relationship. </p>\n\n<p>Scorpius.\nThe mere thought of Albus&rsquo;s boyfriend calmed Albus down considerably. If\nScorpius were here, he would tell Albus that he was being silly worrying about\nHarry&rsquo;s reaction and would give him a Pepper Imp and a kiss on the cheek good\nluck. Albus couldn&rsquo;t help grinning at the thought. </p>\n\n<p>During\nthe course of their relationship, Scorpius had helped Albus grow more confident\nin himself. Scorpius&rsquo;s constant praise had helped Albus considerably in his\nstudies and had helped him grow as a person; He was more comfortable being in\nhis own skin and the summer days he had spent with Scorpius cuddled up together\nby the beech tree by the Hogwarts Lake had been the happiest of his life. <br /></p>\n</p>",
