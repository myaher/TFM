Help me with this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right, sorry Love.&rdquo; He kisses your cheek and begins helping you.</p><p>/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\</p><p>Liz hangs the homecoming poster up on the wall. &ldquo;Did Liz get a new top?&rdquo; Peter asks Ned.</p><p>&ldquo;No. We&rsquo;ve seen that before, but never with that skirt.&rdquo; Ned says. &ldquo;You should probably stop staring at Liz before y/n starts getting suspicious.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not gonna know.&rdquo; Peter scoffs.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you going to tell her that you have a crush on her best friend. While your dating her! Peter this will get you murdered.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t know. But I should stop staring before it gets creepy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Too late.&rdquo; Ned and Peter turn to see MJ at the table. &ldquo;You guys are losers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then why do you sit with us?&rdquo; Ned asks.</p><p>&ldquo;Cause I don&rsquo;t have any friends.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true Michelle and you know it.&rdquo; You say walking past her and sitting in front of Peter. &ldquo;Hey babe, Ned.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey y/n. So are you two going to the Homecoming dance?&rdquo; Ned asks.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, are we Peter?&rdquo; You ask looking at him.</p><p>&ldquo;I did promise. Don&rsquo;t worry you&rsquo;ll get a proper ask.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Huh-huh. Anyways, Peter has Happy texted you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then stop staring at the clock all class long okay. It&rsquo;s getting annoying.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What did I say earlier?&rdquo; You ask him.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait patiently.&rdquo; He responds.</p><p>&ldquo;Then wait. I know Happy. Life is gonna suck if you bother him. Also I&rsquo;m leaving after decathlon practice. Tony called, has some legal stuff I have to handle.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re on a first name basis with Mr. Stark.&rdquo; Ned freaks.

As you made your way back home, you checked the news&ndash;there was no robbery on fifth.\u00a0<br/></p><!-- more --><p>You knew Spiderman was avoiding your question. You suspected it, but the night after when he didn\u2019t even show&ndash;you knew it for sure. You crossed the line.<br/> He was always very secretive, making sure you didn\u2019t know anything about him&ndash;his name, his age, where he lived, where he trained, how he got his powers; he didn\u2019t tell you anything. Sometimes you wondered if you even knew him, but then you ended up chuckling to yourself, the thought dismissed whenever you were able to predict what he was about to say next. In fact, you knew Spiderman better than you knew anyone else in this city, probably even better than you knew Liz.\u00a0</p><p>Sure, you didn\u2019t know the dry details about him, but did that information really matter when you knew all the other things about him? Like, you knew he bit his lip when you made a horrible joke. You knew he had freckles. You guessed he had dark brown hair, because a strand of it peaked from underneath his mask when it was overgrown. You knew he lived somewhere in New York. You knew he was your age, because he never had to shave his face and because his voice gave it away. You knew you cared about him. More than words could say, and you knew not seeing him last night was torture beyond any other. </p><p>*</p><p>Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t matter how much you tried ignoring Peter\u2019s presence, it was impossible when Liz was still venting through her feelings to you and MJ. But that was alright. Besides, you got to finally voice your opinions on her ex boyfriend, although they were never that secret, and as you yelled about how stupid his hair looked half the time Liz rolled her eyes with her large smile sitting proudly on her dark skin. Then she wondered out loud, if she knew who she was&ndash;the girl who stole her boyfriend away from her. You offered Liz to find out who she was, then you offered to TP her house&ndash;which caused her to giggle&ndash;but she declined both, saying it didn\u2019t matter anyway. It was in the past now. You admired Liz for her strength, and gave her a big hug, before the subject turned back to you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo, MJ tells me you\u2019ve been seeing someone?\u201d She asked, laughter echoing in her eyes at the sight of your pink cheeks.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d you let out, but that caused Liz to let out a sound fit for a girl ready to gossip and so you had to tell her. Or rather, you told her a version of the story.\u00a0</p><p>You met him in a park, that much was true. And you hit it off right away, both searching for the owners of the black and white corgi he found at said park. Then he offered to buy you a milkshake and it was blue and red and you talked all afternoon.</p><p>\u201cWait, what\u2019s his name?\u201d Liz pushed, and frightened you looked over at Michelle. She raised her brows as if to say \u2018your call\u2019, and your call was a lie.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIan. He\u2019s a junior as well,\u201d you nodded to her, or to yourself, as your curly haired friend tried her hardest not to roll her eyes at your lie.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAw, that\u2019s so cute,\u201d Liz gushed, brows high and smile wide, \u201cand what does he look like?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d you said quickly, too quickly, before adding, \u201ccute!\u201d</p><p>Liz asked a few more questions, ones you <i>could </i>answer&ndash;like when this started, and if you liked him, and if you considered him a gentlemen, and what his thoughts were on gender equality and if he was smart like you and all other things a best friend should be concerned about when her girl sets her sight on a guy.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been\u2026 weird, the last couple of days,\u201d you confessed slowly, not sure if you could exchange the details to support such a claim, but sure enough you needed to tell someone about it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Liz asked firmly, reminding you of a coach about to prepare the team\u2019s next play. MJ\u2019s eyes lit up slightly at the words, her eyebrow quirking upwards in what you knew meant curiosity from her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI asked him something and he avoided me completely, and he hasn\u2019t talked to me since,\u201d you informed them.\u00a0</p><p>Liz\u2019s eyes rolled comically slow before she mumbled, \u201cboys. Peter used to do that to me <i>all </i>the time.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI think all boys do that,\u201d MJ said, defensively. \u00a0</p><p>Just then the bell rang through the cafeteria and it was the end of girl talk and the beginning of double Chemistry&ndash;just like that, with one simple switch.\u00a0</p><p>It was impossible to concentrate however, when MJ kept sending you funny looks during the lesson and it was even worse when you caught Peter\u2019s brown eyes on you, too. You blamed it on the fact they were lab partners, and nosy Parker just kept looking back because she was looking back, but as your eyes followed their movements, it seemed they were writing notes back and forth to each other on the piece of paper placed between them.\u00a0</p><p>You let out a sigh&ndash;you were being paranoid over nothing. MJ and Peter were friends, for whatever reason, but you had no reason to believe they were talking about you. Why would they?<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>You\u2019ve gotten used to the feeling of someone watching you, and almost like a sixth sense&ndash;you knew exactly where that someone was hanging from. <br/>Twisting to your left, you brought your head into the canopy of buildings above you as you spotted a small blur of red and blur.\u00a0</p><p>A cluster of butterflies crawled into your stomach, making home in it as the widely beloved suit came into view. You didn\u2019t realise how much you missed the sight, how safer you felt now that you saw him. Could you tell him that? Could you even talk to him, after you so blatantly crossed the line the last time you spoke?<br/></p><p>Your hand, on its own accord, shot up into the sky as you waved at him.\u00a0</p><p>He didn\u2019t wave back.\u00a0<br/></p><p>You cursed yourself and the cluster of butterflies in your stomach as you turned around&ndash;feet pushing off the ground much faster than needed to, but you needed to get away from his sight as fast as humanly possible. Unfortunately, he was <i>super</i>human.\u00a0</p><p>With a soft thud, you bumped straight into Spiderman.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWalked right into my web,\u201d he said, voice deeper than you remembered it to be.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awful,\u201d you joked, rolling your eyes as if that could stop the smile from spreading on your face. He didn\u2019t hate you after all. \u201cI thought you hated me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know, I\u2019m sorr&ndash;\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, please don\u2019t. I overstepped,\u201d you tried.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo, no, of course you didn\u2019t!\u201d He assured you quickly, gloved hand reaching for your forearm, \u201cI know you\u2019re only asking because you care about me and it makes sense that you\u2019re curious. I mean, it\u2019s flattering really when such a pretty girl wants to know things about you I just wasn\u2019t sure how you would react if I told you so&ndash;\u201d he rambled on and on, and it took everything in you not to push him into the closest alley and kiss the words right out of his mouth. But instead, you let him speak, words barely registering in your brain as you tried your hardest to calm down the cluster in your stomach. You didn\u2019t even notice when your fingers interlocked around each other, but they did, and it was magical. It was all you wanted, to be next to him again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou have that look in your eyes,\u201d he said, nudging you out of your daze.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat look is that, spidey?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe \u2018I want to kiss him\u2019 look,\u201d he said, hand sneaking around your waist as he pulled you closer. \u201cYou wear it a lot.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d You smirked, and his free hand caught the edge of his mask as he inched it up&ndash;planting a soft kiss on your cheek. \u201cThat\u2019s all I get?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get more after I buy you ice cream,\u201d he announced, voice lighter all of a sudden. You realised something, about his voice, as his mask recloaked his pale skin.\u00a0</p><p>He altered it.\u00a0</p><p>He didn\u2019t use to.</p><p>A small weight fell on your heart at the thought he put yet another shield up against you, and you weren\u2019t sure if it was to protect you or him. Was he ashamed of who he was, was he scared that you\u2019d find out the truth? Would it be so awful if you knew who he was underneath the mask? Because, well, you did know didn\u2019t you?</p><p>You pushed it out of your thoughts, fingers wrapping tighter around his and the pair of you strolled to the nearest ice cream shop. It must\u2019ve been a strange sight, a superhero\u2019s arm wrapped around a girl, in the middle of a random street in New York City. But, New York has seen weirder things than that, you were sure.\u00a0</p><p>Not that it mattered to you&ndash;you were near him, you were holding him, and that\u2019s all you cared about. Not what people thought and how weird you must\u2019ve looked.\u00a0</p><p>After the ice cream was consumed and peppermint kisses exchanged, he moved his mask back down and coughed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d You prompted.</p><p>\u201cMJ.\u201d Your brows frowned together, urging him to speak up. \u201cShe\u2019s my friend from midtown.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>A deep breath in, you tried understanding what he said. Did MJ know Spiderman, all this time? Was she lying to? Did she know who he really was, underneath the mask?</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, she\u2019s a good friend of mine too.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know, she talks about you a lot. And she cares about you,\u201d he nudged you, smile apparent even through his mechanically altered voice, \u201calways makes sure I\u2019m a gentlemen towards you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou talk, like, every day?\u201d You asked timidly, not wanting to come off jealous but knowing, by the small dip in his white eyes, he heard it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s one of my closest friends.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd does she know\u2026\u201d you said, regretting it before the words even formed on your tongue&ndash;but you said it anyway.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe knows Ian, yeah,\u201d he assured you, causing you to roll your eyes. They did tell each other everything.\u00a0</p><p>As Spiderman walked you home, he clued you in on all the things you missed in your seventy something hours apart&ndash;and you him. It was just like before your misguided question, and now you had an answer. An answer you didn\u2019t want, if you thought about it&ndash;but all thought evaporated as he lifted his red mask one more time and kissed you, a kiss to make up for all seventy hours. </p><p>*</p><p>The next morning, you couldn\u2019t help the jealousy in your bones. You knew you shouldn\u2019t have thought about it&ndash;but for some reason, some crazy hormonal reason, you couldn\u2019t help but think MJ was betraying you. She could\u2019ve told you she knew him. She could send hints your way or she could warn you if you\u2019re doing the wrong thing, but MJ didn\u2019t do anything. She lived in silence with the knowledge that you were crushing on her masked best friend&ndash;whoever he was. Since when did MJ know anyone who didn\u2019t go to Midtown? Where did they even meet?</p><p>You were too proud to ask her, a girl you knew since you were thirteen&ndash;and so you were left to wonder all through Math class who it was, and how he knew MJ, and you realised how crazy you were acting only when your pencil snapped in half. </p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d she called out to you as you rushed towards your locker. You opted to ignore her, thinking if you talked to her today you might burst and say the wrong thing, like you usually did. MJ was your best friend, and she knew you, and although you knew she was used to your outburst, you still deemed it unfair on her to be on the receiving end of one&ndash;and so you decided to slam your locker shut instead.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCome on, Y/N,\u201d she tried again, \u201cyou\u2019re honestly not talking to me because I didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d<br/><br/></p><p>\u201cYou know who he is, don\u2019t you? Like, who it is beneath the mask,\u201d you confirmed out loud, and MJ nodded slowly&ndash;as if scared of the air around her.<br/></p><p>\u201cI do, but I promised him I wouldn\u2019t&ndash;\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou kept judging me for seeing him, saying I know nothing about him,\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah, because you don\u2019t know <i>who </i>it is, Y/N,\u201d she tried rationalizing, but the knife you imagined earlier in your back was becoming heavier with each passing word.</p><p>\u201cYou do, though. He\u2019s good enough to be your best friend but not good enough for me to date him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing like that&ndash;\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me who it is, Michelle,\u201d you begged of her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair, I can\u2019t just give away his secrets,\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat if it really sucks not knowing, MJ? You\u2019ll be helping me, your best friend, please,\u201d you asked, desperate to know. Something about the fact Michelle knew him, in real life, made you second guess this whole secret identity thing. Michelle didn\u2019t have a lot of friends, that much was obvious&ndash;and she liked it that way. So how, <i>how</i>, did she know someone like him? Were they really that close if you never even heard of a boy Michelle got along with? Or was the secret that unimportant that he could give it away with ease to anyone?\u00a0</p><p>And if it was the latter, if it truly didn\u2019t matter to him that Michelle knew&ndash;why didn\u2019t you?\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSometimes not knowing is better&ndash;\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome <i>on</i>,\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t always want to know the truth, Y/N,\u201d she emphasized, making you stop. She knew something more, you were certain, and as her face dropped you whipped behind yourself&ndash;catching her line of sight.</p><p>\u00a0 <br/><i>Peter Parker.\u00a0</i></p><p>Peter Parker listening in to the whole conversation.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Peter Parker looking guilty, and upset, and a quiver of fear in his chin.\u00a0</p><p>Peter Parker always poking his nose where it shouldn\u2019t be.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cPeter, what do you want?\u201d You let out, shoulders falling as a small whine left your lips. \u201cWe\u2019re having a private conversation here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re yelling in the middle of the hallway,\u201d he corrected you, and you shot Michelle a glare as if she was the camera and you were on The Office, before you turned back to him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Peter Parker, I never know when to respect people\u2019s privacy and walk away,\u201d you mocked him, voice raising higher as his teeth digged deeper into his thin lip.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one to talk about respecting privacy,\u201d he mumbled, before his eyes shot open and he looked over at Michelle, panic on his freckled face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say to me?\u201d You demanded, and MJ grabbed your hand before the argument could derail any further.\u00a0</p><p><br/>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d she pushed you towards the exit, before turning back to Peter and whispered, \u201cthis is why, it\u2019s because you <i>never </i>watch what you say around her.\u201d</p><h2>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i><a href=\"https://stuckonspidey.tumblr.com/post/185822612681/we-all-wear-masks-peter-parker-three\"> \u00a0three</a></i></h2><h2>\ud83d\udd77\ud83d\udd78\ud83d\udd77\ud83d\udd78\ud83d\udd77</h2><p><i>series taglist; shoot me an ask if you want to be added/removed from the taglist (just saying, if you don\u2019t interact with the fic whatsoever i will remove you, the taglist can only be so long and i want to make sure people who are reading can be added!

As you made your way back home, you checked the news\u2013there was no robbery on fifth.\u00a0<br></p>[[MORE]]<p>You knew Spiderman was avoiding your question. You suspected it, but the night after when he didn\u2019t even show\u2013you knew it for sure. You crossed the line.<br> He was always very secretive, making sure you didn\u2019t know anything about him\u2013his name, his age, where he lived, where he trained, how he got his powers; he didn\u2019t tell you anything. Sometimes you wondered if you even knew him, but then you ended up chuckling to yourself, the thought dismissed whenever you were able to predict what he was about to say next. In fact, you knew Spiderman better than you knew anyone else in this city, probably even better than you knew Liz.\u00a0</p><p>Sure, you didn\u2019t know the dry details about him, but did that information really matter when you knew all the other things about him? Like, you knew he bit his lip when you made a horrible joke. You knew he had freckles. You guessed he had dark brown hair, because a strand of it peaked from underneath his mask when it was overgrown. You knew he lived somewhere in New York. You knew he was your age, because he never had to shave his face and because his voice gave it away. You knew you cared about him. More than words could say, and you knew not seeing him last night was torture beyond any other. </p><p>*</p><p>Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t matter how much you tried ignoring Peter\u2019s presence, it was impossible when Liz was still venting through her feelings to you and MJ. But that was alright. Besides, you got to finally voice your opinions on her ex boyfriend, although they were never that secret, and as you yelled about how stupid his hair looked half the time Liz rolled her eyes with her large smile sitting proudly on her dark skin. Then she wondered out loud, if she knew who she was\u2013the girl who stole her boyfriend away from her. You offered Liz to find out who she was, then you offered to TP her house\u2013which caused her to giggle\u2013but she declined both, saying it didn\u2019t matter anyway. It was in the past now. You admired Liz for her strength, and gave her a big hug, before the subject turned back to you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo, MJ tells me you\u2019ve been seeing someone?\u201d She asked, laughter echoing in her eyes at the sight of your pink cheeks.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d you let out, but that caused Liz to let out a sound fit for a girl ready to gossip and so you had to tell her. Or rather, you told her a version of the story.\u00a0</p><p>You met him in a park, that much was true. And you hit it off right away, both searching for the owners of the black and white corgi he found at said park. Then he offered to buy you a milkshake and it was blue and red and you talked all afternoon.</p><p>\u201cWait, what\u2019s his name?\u201d Liz pushed, and frightened you looked over at Michelle. She raised her brows as if to say \u2018your call\u2019, and your call was a lie.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIan. He\u2019s a junior as well,\u201d you nodded to her, or to yourself, as your curly haired friend tried her hardest not to roll her eyes at your lie.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAw, that\u2019s so cute,\u201d Liz gushed, brows high and smile wide, \u201cand what does he look like?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d you said quickly, too quickly, before adding, \u201ccute!\u201d</p><p>Liz asked a few more questions, ones you <i>could </i>answer\u2013like when this started, and if you liked him, and if you considered him a gentlemen, and what his thoughts were on gender equality and if he was smart like you and all other things a best friend should be concerned about when her girl sets her sight on a guy.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been\u2026 weird, the last couple of days,\u201d you confessed slowly, not sure if you could exchange the details to support such a claim, but sure enough you needed to tell someone about it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Liz asked firmly, reminding you of a coach about to prepare the team\u2019s next play. MJ\u2019s eyes lit up slightly at the words, her eyebrow quirking upwards in what you knew meant curiosity from her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI asked him something and he avoided me completely, and he hasn\u2019t talked to me since,\u201d you informed them.\u00a0</p><p>Liz\u2019s eyes rolled comically slow before she mumbled, \u201cboys. Peter used to do that to me <i>all </i>the time.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI think all boys do that,\u201d MJ said, defensively. \u00a0</p><p>Just then the bell rang through the cafeteria and it was the end of girl talk and the beginning of double Chemistry\u2013just like that, with one simple switch.\u00a0</p><p>It was impossible to concentrate however, when MJ kept sending you funny looks during the lesson and it was even worse when you caught Peter\u2019s brown eyes on you, too. You blamed it on the fact they were lab partners, and nosy Parker just kept looking back because she was looking back, but as your eyes followed their movements, it seemed they were writing notes back and forth to each other on the piece of paper placed between them.\u00a0</p><p>You let out a sigh\u2013you were being paranoid over nothing. MJ and Peter were friends, for whatever reason, but you had no reason to believe they were talking about you. Why would they?<br></p><p><br></p><p>You\u2019ve gotten used to the feeling of someone watching you, and almost like a sixth sense\u2013you knew exactly where that someone was hanging from. <br>Twisting to your left, you brought your head into the canopy of buildings above you as you spotted a small blur of red and blur.\u00a0</p><p>A cluster of butterflies crawled into your stomach, making home in it as the widely beloved suit came into view. You didn\u2019t realise how much you missed the sight, how safer you felt now that you saw him. Could you tell him that? Could you even talk to him, after you so blatantly crossed the line the last time you spoke?<br></p><p>Your hand, on its own accord, shot up into the sky as you waved at him.\u00a0</p><p>He didn\u2019t wave back.\u00a0<br></p><p>You cursed yourself and the cluster of butterflies in your stomach as you turned around\u2013feet pushing off the ground much faster than needed to, but you needed to get away from his sight as fast as humanly possible. Unfortunately, he was <i>super</i>human.\u00a0</p><p>With a soft thud, you bumped straight into Spiderman.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWalked right into my web,\u201d he said, voice deeper than you remembered it to be.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awful,\u201d you joked, rolling your eyes as if that could stop the smile from spreading on your face. He didn\u2019t hate you after all. \u201cI thought you hated me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know, I\u2019m sorr\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, please don\u2019t. I overstepped,\u201d you tried.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo, no, of course you didn\u2019t!\u201d He assured you quickly, gloved hand reaching for your forearm, \u201cI know you\u2019re only asking because you care about me and it makes sense that you\u2019re curious. I mean, it\u2019s flattering really when such a pretty girl wants to know things about you I just wasn\u2019t sure how you would react if I told you so\u2013\u201d he rambled on and on, and it took everything in you not to push him into the closest alley and kiss the words right out of his mouth. But instead, you let him speak, words barely registering in your brain as you tried your hardest to calm down the cluster in your stomach. You didn\u2019t even notice when your fingers interlocked around each other, but they did, and it was magical. It was all you wanted, to be next to him again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou have that look in your eyes,\u201d he said, nudging you out of your daze.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat look is that, spidey?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe \u2018I want to kiss him\u2019 look,\u201d he said, hand sneaking around your waist as he pulled you closer. \u201cYou wear it a lot.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d You smirked, and his free hand caught the edge of his mask as he inched it up\u2013planting a soft kiss on your cheek. \u201cThat\u2019s all I get?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get more after I buy you ice cream,\u201d he announced, voice lighter all of a sudden. You realised something, about his voice, as his mask recloaked his pale skin.\u00a0</p><p>He altered it.\u00a0</p><p>He didn\u2019t use to.</p><p>A small weight fell on your heart at the thought he put yet another shield up against you, and you weren\u2019t sure if it was to protect you or him. Was he ashamed of who he was, was he scared that you\u2019d find out the truth? Would it be so awful if you knew who he was underneath the mask? Because, well, you did know didn\u2019t you?</p><p>You pushed it out of your thoughts, fingers wrapping tighter around his and the pair of you strolled to the nearest ice cream shop. It must\u2019ve been a strange sight, a superhero\u2019s arm wrapped around a girl, in the middle of a random street in New York City. But, New York has seen weirder things than that, you were sure.\u00a0</p><p>Not that it mattered to you\u2013you were near him, you were holding him, and that\u2019s all you cared about. Not what people thought and how weird you must\u2019ve looked.\u00a0</p><p>After the ice cream was consumed and peppermint kisses exchanged, he moved his mask back down and coughed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d You prompted.</p><p>\u201cMJ.\u201d Your brows frowned together, urging him to speak up. \u201cShe\u2019s my friend from midtown.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>A deep breath in, you tried understanding what he said. Did MJ know Spiderman, all this time? Was she lying to? Did she know who he really was, underneath the mask?</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, she\u2019s a good friend of mine too.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know, she talks about you a lot. And she cares about you,\u201d he nudged you, smile apparent even through his mechanically altered voice, \u201calways makes sure I\u2019m a gentlemen towards you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou talk, like, every day?\u201d You asked timidly, not wanting to come off jealous but knowing, by the small dip in his white eyes, he heard it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s one of my closest friends.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd does she know\u2026\u201d you said, regretting it before the words even formed on your tongue\u2013but you said it anyway.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe knows Ian, yeah,\u201d he assured you, causing you to roll your eyes. They did tell each other everything.\u00a0</p><p>As Spiderman walked you home, he clued you in on all the things you missed in your seventy something hours apart\u2013and you him. It was just like before your misguided question, and now you had an answer. An answer you didn\u2019t want, if you thought about it\u2013but all thought evaporated as he lifted his red mask one more time and kissed you, a kiss to make up for all seventy hours. </p><p>*</p><p>The next morning, you couldn\u2019t help the jealousy in your bones. You knew you shouldn\u2019t have thought about it\u2013but for some reason, some crazy hormonal reason, you couldn\u2019t help but think MJ was betraying you. She could\u2019ve told you she knew him. She could send hints your way or she could warn you if you\u2019re doing the wrong thing, but MJ didn\u2019t do anything. She lived in silence with the knowledge that you were crushing on her masked best friend\u2013whoever he was. Since when did MJ know anyone who didn\u2019t go to Midtown? Where did they even meet?</p><p>You were too proud to ask her, a girl you knew since you were thirteen\u2013and so you were left to wonder all through Math class who it was, and how he knew MJ, and you realised how crazy you were acting only when your pencil snapped in half. </p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d she called out to you as you rushed towards your locker. You opted to ignore her, thinking if you talked to her today you might burst and say the wrong thing, like you usually did. MJ was your best friend, and she knew you, and although you knew she was used to your outburst, you still deemed it unfair on her to be on the receiving end of one\u2013and so you decided to slam your locker shut instead.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCome on, Y/N,\u201d she tried again, \u201cyou\u2019re honestly not talking to me because I didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d<br><br></p><p>\u201cYou know who he is, don\u2019t you? Like, who it is beneath the mask,\u201d you confirmed out loud, and MJ nodded slowly\u2013as if scared of the air around her.<br></p><p>\u201cI do, but I promised him I wouldn\u2019t\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou kept judging me for seeing him, saying I know nothing about him,\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah, because you don\u2019t know <i>who </i>it is, Y/N,\u201d she tried rationalizing, but the knife you imagined earlier in your back was becoming heavier with each passing word.</p><p>\u201cYou do, though. He\u2019s good enough to be your best friend but not good enough for me to date him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing like that\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me who it is, Michelle,\u201d you begged of her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair, I can\u2019t just give away his secrets,\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat if it really sucks not knowing, MJ? You\u2019ll be helping me, your best friend, please,\u201d you asked, desperate to know. Something about the fact Michelle knew him, in real life, made you second guess this whole secret identity thing. Michelle didn\u2019t have a lot of friends, that much was obvious\u2013and she liked it that way. So how, <i>how</i>, did she know someone like him? Were they really that close if you never even heard of a boy Michelle got along with? Or was the secret that unimportant that he could give it away with ease to anyone?\u00a0</p><p>And if it was the latter, if it truly didn\u2019t matter to him that Michelle knew\u2013why didn\u2019t you?\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSometimes not knowing is better\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome <i>on</i>,\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t always want to know the truth, Y/N,\u201d she emphasized, making you stop. She knew something more, you were certain, and as her face dropped you whipped behind yourself\u2013catching her line of sight.</p><p>\u00a0 <br><i>Peter Parker.\u00a0</i></p><p>Peter Parker listening in to the whole conversation.\u00a0<br></p><p>Peter Parker looking guilty, and upset, and a quiver of fear in his chin.\u00a0</p><p>Peter Parker always poking his nose where it shouldn\u2019t be.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cPeter, what do you want?\u201d You let out, shoulders falling as a small whine left your lips. \u201cWe\u2019re having a private conversation here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re yelling in the middle of the hallway,\u201d he corrected you, and you shot Michelle a glare as if she was the camera and you were on The Office, before you turned back to him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Peter Parker, I never know when to respect people\u2019s privacy and walk away,\u201d you mocked him, voice raising higher as his teeth digged deeper into his thin lip.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one to talk about respecting privacy,\u201d he mumbled, before his eyes shot open and he looked over at Michelle, panic on his freckled face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say to me?\u201d You demanded, and MJ grabbed your hand before the argument could derail any further.\u00a0</p><p><br>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d she pushed you towards the exit, before turning back to Peter and whispered, \u201cthis is why, it\u2019s because you <i>never </i>watch what you say around her.\u201d</p><h2>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i><a href=\"https://stuckonspidey.tumblr.com/post/185822612681/we-all-wear-masks-peter-parker-three\"> \u00a0three</a></i></h2><h2>\ud83d\udd77\ud83d\udd78\ud83d\udd77\ud83d\udd78\ud83d\udd77</h2><p><i>series taglist; shoot me an ask if you want to be added/removed from the taglist (just saying, if you don\u2019t interact with the fic whatsoever i will remove you, the taglist can only be so long and i want to make sure people who are reading can be added!

As you made your way back home, you checked the news\u2013there was no robbery on fifth.\u00a0<br></p>[[MORE]]<p>You knew Spiderman was avoiding your question. You suspected it, but the night after when he didn\u2019t even show\u2013you knew it for sure. You crossed the line.<br> He was always very secretive, making sure you didn\u2019t know anything about him\u2013his name, his age, where he lived, where he trained, how he got his powers; he didn\u2019t tell you anything. Sometimes you wondered if you even knew him, but then you ended up chuckling to yourself, the thought dismissed whenever you were able to predict what he was about to say next. In fact, you knew Spiderman better than you knew anyone else in this city, probably even better than you knew Liz.\u00a0</p><p>Sure, you didn\u2019t know the dry details about him, but did that information really matter when you knew all the other things about him? Like, you knew he bit his lip when you made a horrible joke. You knew he had freckles. You guessed he had dark brown hair, because a strand of it peaked from underneath his mask when it was overgrown. You knew he lived somewhere in New York. You knew he was your age, because he never had to shave his face and because his voice gave it away. You knew you cared about him. More than words could say, and you knew not seeing him last night was torture beyond any other. </p><p>*</p><p>Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t matter how much you tried ignoring Peter\u2019s presence, it was impossible when Liz was still venting through her feelings to you and MJ. But that was alright. Besides, you got to finally voice your opinions on her ex boyfriend, although they were never that secret, and as you yelled about how stupid his hair looked half the time Liz rolled her eyes with her large smile sitting proudly on her dark skin. Then she wondered out loud, if she knew who she was\u2013the girl who stole her boyfriend away from her. You offered Liz to find out who she was, then you offered to TP her house\u2013which caused her to giggle\u2013but she declined both, saying it didn\u2019t matter anyway. It was in the past now. You admired Liz for her strength, and gave her a big hug, before the subject turned back to you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo, MJ tells me you\u2019ve been seeing someone?\u201d She asked, laughter echoing in her eyes at the sight of your pink cheeks.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d you let out, but that caused Liz to let out a sound fit for a girl ready to gossip and so you had to tell her. Or rather, you told her a version of the story.\u00a0</p><p>You met him in a park, that much was true. And you hit it off right away, both searching for the owners of the black and white corgi he found at said park. Then he offered to buy you a milkshake and it was blue and red and you talked all afternoon.</p><p>\u201cWait, what\u2019s his name?\u201d Liz pushed, and frightened you looked over at Michelle. She raised her brows as if to say \u2018your call\u2019, and your call was a lie.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIan. He\u2019s a junior as well,\u201d you nodded to her, or to yourself, as your curly haired friend tried her hardest not to roll her eyes at your lie.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAw, that\u2019s so cute,\u201d Liz gushed, brows high and smile wide, \u201cand what does he look like?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d you said quickly, too quickly, before adding, \u201ccute!\u201d</p><p>Liz asked a few more questions, ones you <i>could </i>answer\u2013like when this started, and if you liked him, and if you considered him a gentlemen, and what his thoughts were on gender equality and if he was smart like you and all other things a best friend should be concerned about when her girl sets her sight on a guy.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been\u2026 weird, the last couple of days,\u201d you confessed slowly, not sure if you could exchange the details to support such a claim, but sure enough you needed to tell someone about it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Liz asked firmly, reminding you of a coach about to prepare the team\u2019s next play. MJ\u2019s eyes lit up slightly at the words, her eyebrow quirking upwards in what you knew meant curiosity from her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI asked him something and he avoided me completely, and he hasn\u2019t talked to me since,\u201d you informed them.\u00a0</p><p>Liz\u2019s eyes rolled comically slow before she mumbled, \u201cboys. Peter used to do that to me <i>all </i>the time.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI think all boys do that,\u201d MJ said, defensively. \u00a0</p><p>Just then the bell rang through the cafeteria and it was the end of girl talk and the beginning of double Chemistry\u2013just like that, with one simple switch.\u00a0</p><p>It was impossible to concentrate however, when MJ kept sending you funny looks during the lesson and it was even worse when you caught Peter\u2019s brown eyes on you, too. You blamed it on the fact they were lab partners, and nosy Parker just kept looking back because she was looking back, but as your eyes followed their movements, it seemed they were writing notes back and forth to each other on the piece of paper placed between them.\u00a0</p><p>You let out a sigh\u2013you were being paranoid over nothing. MJ and Peter were friends, for whatever reason, but you had no reason to believe they were talking about you. Why would they?<br></p><p><br></p><p>You\u2019ve gotten used to the feeling of someone watching you, and almost like a sixth sense\u2013you knew exactly where that someone was hanging from. <br>Twisting to your left, you brought your head into the canopy of buildings above you as you spotted a small blur of red and blur.\u00a0</p><p>A cluster of butterflies crawled into your stomach, making home in it as the widely beloved suit came into view. You didn\u2019t realise how much you missed the sight, how safer you felt now that you saw him. Could you tell him that? Could you even talk to him, after you so blatantly crossed the line the last time you spoke?<br></p><p>Your hand, on its own accord, shot up into the sky as you waved at him.\u00a0</p><p>He didn\u2019t wave back.\u00a0<br></p><p>You cursed yourself and the cluster of butterflies in your stomach as you turned around\u2013feet pushing off the ground much faster than needed to, but you needed to get away from his sight as fast as humanly possible. Unfortunately, he was <i>super</i>human.\u00a0</p><p>With a soft thud, you bumped straight into Spiderman.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWalked right into my web,\u201d he said, voice deeper than you remembered it to be.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awful,\u201d you joked, rolling your eyes as if that could stop the smile from spreading on your face. He didn\u2019t hate you after all. \u201cI thought you hated me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know, I\u2019m sorr\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, please don\u2019t. I overstepped,\u201d you tried.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo, no, of course you didn\u2019t!\u201d He assured you quickly, gloved hand reaching for your forearm, \u201cI know you\u2019re only asking because you care about me and it makes sense that you\u2019re curious. I mean, it\u2019s flattering really when such a pretty girl wants to know things about you I just wasn\u2019t sure how you would react if I told you so\u2013\u201d he rambled on and on, and it took everything in you not to push him into the closest alley and kiss the words right out of his mouth. But instead, you let him speak, words barely registering in your brain as you tried your hardest to calm down the cluster in your stomach. You didn\u2019t even notice when your fingers interlocked around each other, but they did, and it was magical. It was all you wanted, to be next to him again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou have that look in your eyes,\u201d he said, nudging you out of your daze.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat look is that, spidey?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe \u2018I want to kiss him\u2019 look,\u201d he said, hand sneaking around your waist as he pulled you closer. \u201cYou wear it a lot.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d You smirked, and his free hand caught the edge of his mask as he inched it up\u2013planting a soft kiss on your cheek. \u201cThat\u2019s all I get?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get more after I buy you ice cream,\u201d he announced, voice lighter all of a sudden. You realised something, about his voice, as his mask recloaked his pale skin.\u00a0</p><p>He altered it.\u00a0</p><p>He didn\u2019t use to.</p><p>A small weight fell on your heart at the thought he put yet another shield up against you, and you weren\u2019t sure if it was to protect you or him. Was he ashamed of who he was, was he scared that you\u2019d find out the truth? Would it be so awful if you knew who he was underneath the mask? Because, well, you did know didn\u2019t you?</p><p>You pushed it out of your thoughts, fingers wrapping tighter around his and the pair of you strolled to the nearest ice cream shop. It must\u2019ve been a strange sight, a superhero\u2019s arm wrapped around a girl, in the middle of a random street in New York City. But, New York has seen weirder things than that, you were sure.\u00a0</p><p>Not that it mattered to you\u2013you were near him, you were holding him, and that\u2019s all you cared about. Not what people thought and how weird you must\u2019ve looked.\u00a0</p><p>After the ice cream was consumed and peppermint kisses exchanged, he moved his mask back down and coughed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d You prompted.</p><p>\u201cMJ.\u201d Your brows frowned together, urging him to speak up. \u201cShe\u2019s my friend from midtown.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>A deep breath in, you tried understanding what he said. Did MJ know Spiderman, all this time? Was she lying to? Did she know who he really was, underneath the mask?</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, she\u2019s a good friend of mine too.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know, she talks about you a lot. And she cares about you,\u201d he nudged you, smile apparent even through his mechanically altered voice, \u201calways makes sure I\u2019m a gentlemen towards you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou talk, like, every day?\u201d You asked timidly, not wanting to come off jealous but knowing, by the small dip in his white eyes, he heard it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s one of my closest friends.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd does she know\u2026\u201d you said, regretting it before the words even formed on your tongue\u2013but you said it anyway.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe knows Ian, yeah,\u201d he assured you, causing you to roll your eyes. They did tell each other everything.\u00a0</p><p>As Spiderman walked you home, he clued you in on all the things you missed in your seventy something hours apart\u2013and you him. It was just like before your misguided question, and now you had an answer. An answer you didn\u2019t want, if you thought about it\u2013but all thought evaporated as he lifted his red mask one more time and kissed you, a kiss to make up for all seventy hours. </p><p>*</p><p>The next morning, you couldn\u2019t help the jealousy in your bones. You knew you shouldn\u2019t have thought about it\u2013but for some reason, some crazy hormonal reason, you couldn\u2019t help but think MJ was betraying you. She could\u2019ve told you she knew him. She could send hints your way or she could warn you if you\u2019re doing the wrong thing, but MJ didn\u2019t do anything. She lived in silence with the knowledge that you were crushing on her masked best friend\u2013whoever he was. Since when did MJ know anyone who didn\u2019t go to Midtown? Where did they even meet?</p><p>You were too proud to ask her, a girl you knew since you were thirteen\u2013and so you were left to wonder all through Math class who it was, and how he knew MJ, and you realised how crazy you were acting only when your pencil snapped in half. </p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d she called out to you as you rushed towards your locker. You opted to ignore her, thinking if you talked to her today you might burst and say the wrong thing, like you usually did. MJ was your best friend, and she knew you, and although you knew she was used to your outburst, you still deemed it unfair on her to be on the receiving end of one\u2013and so you decided to slam your locker shut instead.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCome on, Y/N,\u201d she tried again, \u201cyou\u2019re honestly not talking to me because I didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d<br><br></p><p>\u201cYou know who he is, don\u2019t you? Like, who it is beneath the mask,\u201d you confirmed out loud, and MJ nodded slowly\u2013as if scared of the air around her.<br></p><p>\u201cI do, but I promised him I wouldn\u2019t\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou kept judging me for seeing him, saying I know nothing about him,\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah, because you don\u2019t know <i>who </i>it is, Y/N,\u201d she tried rationalizing, but the knife you imagined earlier in your back was becoming heavier with each passing word.</p><p>\u201cYou do, though. He\u2019s good enough to be your best friend but not good enough for me to date him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing like that\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me who it is, Michelle,\u201d you begged of her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair, I can\u2019t just give away his secrets,\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat if it really sucks not knowing, MJ? You\u2019ll be helping me, your best friend, please,\u201d you asked, desperate to know. Something about the fact Michelle knew him, in real life, made you second guess this whole secret identity thing. Michelle didn\u2019t have a lot of friends, that much was obvious\u2013and she liked it that way. So how, <i>how</i>, did she know someone like him? Were they really that close if you never even heard of a boy Michelle got along with? Or was the secret that unimportant that he could give it away with ease to anyone?\u00a0</p><p>And if it was the latter, if it truly didn\u2019t matter to him that Michelle knew\u2013why didn\u2019t you?\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSometimes not knowing is better\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome <i>on</i>,\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t always want to know the truth, Y/N,\u201d she emphasized, making you stop. She knew something more, you were certain, and as her face dropped you whipped behind yourself\u2013catching her line of sight.</p><p>\u00a0 <br><i>Peter Parker.\u00a0</i></p><p>Peter Parker listening in to the whole conversation.\u00a0<br></p><p>Peter Parker looking guilty, and upset, and a quiver of fear in his chin.\u00a0</p><p>Peter Parker always poking his nose where it shouldn\u2019t be.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cPeter, what do you want?\u201d You let out, shoulders falling as a small whine left your lips. \u201cWe\u2019re having a private conversation here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re yelling in the middle of the hallway,\u201d he corrected you, and you shot Michelle a glare as if she was the camera and you were on The Office, before you turned back to him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Peter Parker, I never know when to respect people\u2019s privacy and walk away,\u201d you mocked him, voice raising higher as his teeth digged deeper into his thin lip.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one to talk about respecting privacy,\u201d he mumbled, before his eyes shot open and he looked over at Michelle, panic on his freckled face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say to me?\u201d You demanded, and MJ grabbed your hand before the argument could derail any further.\u00a0</p><p><br>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d she pushed you towards the exit, before turning back to Peter and whispered, \u201cthis is why, it\u2019s because you <i>never </i>watch what you say around her.\u201d</p><h2>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i><a href=\"https://stuckonspidey.tumblr.com/post/185822612681/we-all-wear-masks-peter-parker-three\"> \u00a0three</a></i></h2><h2>\ud83d\udd77\ud83d\udd78\ud83d\udd77\ud83d\udd78\ud83d\udd77</h2><p><i>series taglist; shoot me an ask if you want to be added/removed from the taglist (just saying, if you don\u2019t interact with the fic whatsoever i will remove you, the taglist can only be so long and i want to make sure people who are reading can be added!

                "content": "<p><b>SUMMARY; </b>Y/N is falling for the friendly neighborhood Spiderman. Unrelated, her and that dork Peter do <i>not </i>get along. (<b>enemies to lovers au)</b><br /></p><p><b>PAIRING; </b>peter parker x reader</p><p><b>WORDS; </b>2554</p><p><b>WARNING; </b>reader being dumbdumb<strike> and short i&rsquo;m so sorry</strike></p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Spiderman left you stranded behind him, feet still dangling from the edge of the roof and before you knew it his red and blue shadow had disappeared into the night. As you made your way back home, you checked the news&ndash;there was no robbery on fifth.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You knew Spiderman was avoiding your question. You suspected it, but the night after when he didn&rsquo;t even show&ndash;you knew it for sure. You crossed the line.<br /> He was always very secretive, making sure you didn&rsquo;t know anything about him&ndash;his name, his age, where he lived, where he trained, how he got his powers; he didn&rsquo;t tell you anything. Sometimes you wondered if you even knew him, but then you ended up chuckling to yourself, the thought dismissed whenever you were able to predict what he was about to say next. In fact, you knew Spiderman better than you knew anyone else in this city, probably even better than you knew Liz.&nbsp;</p><p>Sure, you didn&rsquo;t know the dry details about him, but did that information really matter when you knew all the other things about him? Like, you knew he bit his lip when you made a horrible joke. You knew he had freckles. You guessed he had dark brown hair, because a strand of it peaked from underneath his mask when it was overgrown. You knew he lived somewhere in New York. You knew he was your age, because he never had to shave his face and because his voice gave it away. You knew you cared about him. More than words could say, and you knew not seeing him last night was torture beyond any other. </p><p>*</p><p>Unfortunately, it didn&rsquo;t matter how much you tried ignoring Peter&rsquo;s presence, it was impossible when Liz was still venting through her feelings to you and MJ. But that was alright. Besides, you got to finally voice your opinions on her ex boyfriend, although they were never that secret, and as you yelled about how stupid his hair looked half the time Liz rolled her eyes with her large smile sitting proudly on her dark skin. Then she wondered out loud, if she knew who she was&ndash;the girl who stole her boyfriend away from her. You offered Liz to find out who she was, then you offered to TP her house&ndash;which caused her to giggle&ndash;but she declined both, saying it didn&rsquo;t matter anyway. It was in the past now. You admired Liz for her strength, and gave her a big hug, before the subject turned back to you.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;So, MJ tells me you&rsquo;ve been seeing someone?&rdquo; She asked, laughter echoing in her eyes at the sight of your pink cheeks.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s complicated,&rdquo; you let out, but that caused Liz to let out a sound fit for a girl ready to gossip and so you had to tell her. Or rather, you told her a version of the story.&nbsp;</p><p>You met him in a park, that much was true. And you hit it off right away, both searching for the owners of the black and white corgi he found at said park. Then he offered to buy you a milkshake and it was blue and red and you talked all afternoon.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, what&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo; Liz pushed, and frightened you looked over at Michelle. She raised her brows as if to say &lsquo;your call&rsquo;, and your call was a lie.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Ian. He&rsquo;s a junior as well,&rdquo; you nodded to her, or to yourself, as your curly haired friend tried her hardest not to roll her eyes at your lie.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Aw, that&rsquo;s so cute,&rdquo; Liz gushed, brows high and smile wide, &ldquo;and what does he look like?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; you said quickly, too quickly, before adding, &ldquo;cute!&rdquo;</p><p>Liz asked a few more questions, ones you <i>could </i>answer&ndash;like when this started, and if you liked him, and if you considered him a gentlemen, and what his thoughts were on gender equality and if he was smart like you and all other things a best friend should be concerned about when her girl sets her sight on a guy.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been&hellip; weird, the last couple of days,&rdquo; you confessed slowly, not sure if you could exchange the details to support such a claim, but sure enough you needed to tell someone about it.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Liz asked firmly, reminding you of a coach about to prepare the team&rsquo;s next play. MJ&rsquo;s eyes lit up slightly at the words, her eyebrow quirking upwards in what you knew meant curiosity from her.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I asked him something and he avoided me completely, and he hasn&rsquo;t talked to me since,&rdquo; you informed them.&nbsp;</p><p>Liz&rsquo;s eyes rolled comically slow before she mumbled, &ldquo;boys. Peter used to do that to me <i>all </i>the time.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I think all boys do that,&rdquo; MJ said, defensively. &nbsp;</p><p>Just then the bell rang through the cafeteria and it was the end of girl talk and the beginning of double Chemistry&ndash;just like that, with one simple switch.&nbsp;</p><p>It was impossible to concentrate however, when MJ kept sending you funny looks during the lesson and it was even worse when you caught Peter&rsquo;s brown eyes on you, too. You blamed it on the fact they were lab partners, and nosy Parker just kept looking back because she was looking back, but as your eyes followed their movements, it seemed they were writing notes back and forth to each other on the piece of paper placed between them.&nbsp;</p><p>You let out a sigh&ndash;you were being paranoid over nothing. MJ and Peter were friends, for whatever reason, but you had no reason to believe they were talking about you. Why would they?<br /></p><p><br /></p><p>You&rsquo;ve gotten used to the feeling of someone watching you, and almost like a sixth sense&ndash;you knew exactly where that someone was hanging from. <br />Twisting to your left, you brought your head into the canopy of buildings above you as you spotted a small blur of red and blur.&nbsp;</p><p>A cluster of butterflies crawled into your stomach, making home in it as the widely beloved suit came into view. You didn&rsquo;t realise how much you missed the sight, how safer you felt now that you saw him. Could you tell him that? Could you even talk to him, after you so blatantly crossed the line the last time you spoke?<br /></p><p>Your hand, on its own accord, shot up into the sky as you waved at him.&nbsp;</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t wave back.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You cursed yourself and the cluster of butterflies in your stomach as you turned around&ndash;feet pushing off the ground much faster than needed to, but you needed to get away from his sight as fast as humanly possible. Unfortunately, he was <i>super</i>human.&nbsp;</p><p>With a soft thud, you bumped straight into Spiderman.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Walked right into my web,&rdquo; he said, voice deeper than you remembered it to be.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re awful,&rdquo; you joked, rolling your eyes as if that could stop the smile from spreading on your face. He didn&rsquo;t hate you after all. &ldquo;I thought you hated me.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I know, I&rsquo;m sorr&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, please don&rsquo;t. I overstepped,&rdquo; you tried.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;No, no, of course you didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; He assured you quickly, gloved hand reaching for your forearm, &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re only asking because you care about me and it makes sense that you&rsquo;re curious. I mean, it&rsquo;s flattering really when such a pretty girl wants to know things about you I just wasn&rsquo;t sure how you would react if I told you so&ndash;&rdquo; he rambled on and on, and it took everything in you not to push him into the closest alley and kiss the words right out of his mouth. But instead, you let him speak, words barely registering in your brain as you tried your hardest to calm down the cluster in your stomach. You didn&rsquo;t even notice when your fingers interlocked around each other, but they did, and it was magical. It was all you wanted, to be next to him again.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You have that look in your eyes,&rdquo; he said, nudging you out of your daze.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What look is that, spidey?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;I want to kiss him&rsquo; look,&rdquo; he said, hand sneaking around your waist as he pulled you closer. &ldquo;You wear it a lot.&rdquo;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; You smirked, and his free hand caught the edge of his mask as he inched it up&ndash;planting a soft kiss on your cheek. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I get?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get more after I buy you ice cream,&rdquo; he announced, voice lighter all of a sudden. You realised something, about his voice, as his mask recloaked his pale skin.&nbsp;</p><p>He altered it.&nbsp;</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t use to.</p><p>A small weight fell on your heart at the thought he put yet another shield up against you, and you weren&rsquo;t sure if it was to protect you or him. Was he ashamed of who he was, was he scared that you&rsquo;d find out the truth? Would it be so awful if you knew who he was underneath the mask? Because, well, you did know didn&rsquo;t you?</p><p>You pushed it out of your thoughts, fingers wrapping tighter around his and the pair of you strolled to the nearest ice cream shop. It must&rsquo;ve been a strange sight, a superhero&rsquo;s arm wrapped around a girl, in the middle of a random street in New York City. But, New York has seen weirder things than that, you were sure.&nbsp;</p><p>Not that it mattered to you&ndash;you were near him, you were holding him, and that&rsquo;s all you cared about. Not what people thought and how weird you must&rsquo;ve looked.&nbsp;</p><p>After the ice cream was consumed and peppermint kisses exchanged, he moved his mask back down and coughed.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; You prompted.</p><p>&ldquo;MJ.&rdquo; Your brows frowned together, urging him to speak up. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s my friend from midtown.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>A deep breath in, you tried understanding what he said. Did MJ know Spiderman, all this time? Was she lying to? Did she know who he really was, underneath the mask?</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, yeah, she&rsquo;s a good friend of mine too.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I know, she talks about you a lot. And she cares about you,&rdquo; he nudged you, smile apparent even through his mechanically altered voice, &ldquo;always makes sure I&rsquo;m a gentlemen towards you.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You talk, like, every day?&rdquo; You asked timidly, not wanting to come off jealous but knowing, by the small dip in his white eyes, he heard it.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s one of my closest friends.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;And does she know&hellip;&rdquo; you said, regretting it before the words even formed on your tongue&ndash;but you said it anyway.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;She knows Ian, yeah,&rdquo; he assured you, causing you to roll your eyes. They did tell each other everything.&nbsp;</p><p>As Spiderman walked you home, he clued you in on all the things you missed in your seventy something hours apart&ndash;and you him. It was just like before your misguided question, and now you had an answer. An answer you didn&rsquo;t want, if you thought about it&ndash;but all thought evaporated as he lifted his red mask one more time and kissed you, a kiss to make up for all seventy hours. </p><p>*</p><p>The next morning, you couldn&rsquo;t help the jealousy in your bones. You knew you shouldn&rsquo;t have thought about it&ndash;but for some reason, some crazy hormonal reason, you couldn&rsquo;t help but think MJ was betraying you. She could&rsquo;ve told you she knew him. She could send hints your way or she could warn you if you&rsquo;re doing the wrong thing, but MJ didn&rsquo;t do anything. She lived in silence with the knowledge that you were crushing on her masked best friend&ndash;whoever he was. Since when did MJ know anyone who didn&rsquo;t go to Midtown? Where did they even meet?</p><p>You were too proud to ask her, a girl you knew since you were thirteen&ndash;and so you were left to wonder all through Math class who it was, and how he knew MJ, and you realised how crazy you were acting only when your pencil snapped in half. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N,&rdquo; she called out to you as you rushed towards your locker. You opted to ignore her, thinking if you talked to her today you might burst and say the wrong thing, like you usually did. MJ was your best friend, and she knew you, and although you knew she was used to your outburst, you still deemed it unfair on her to be on the receiving end of one&ndash;and so you decided to slam your locker shut instead.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, Y/N,&rdquo; she tried again, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re honestly not talking to me because I didn&rsquo;t tell you?&rdquo;<br /><br /></p><p>&ldquo;You know who he is, don&rsquo;t you? Like, who it is beneath the mask,&rdquo; you confirmed out loud, and MJ nodded slowly&ndash;as if scared of the air around her.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I do, but I promised him I wouldn&rsquo;t&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You kept judging me for seeing him, saying I know nothing about him,&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, because you don&rsquo;t know <i>who </i>it is, Y/N,&rdquo; she tried rationalizing, but the knife you imagined earlier in your back was becoming heavier with each passing word.</p><p>&ldquo;You do, though. He&rsquo;s good enough to be your best friend but not good enough for me to date him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s nothing like that&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me who it is, Michelle,&rdquo; you begged of her.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not fair, I can&rsquo;t just give away his secrets,&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What if it really sucks not knowing, MJ? You&rsquo;ll be helping me, your best friend, please,&rdquo; you asked, desperate to know. Something about the fact Michelle knew him, in real life, made you second guess this whole secret identity thing. Michelle didn&rsquo;t have a lot of friends, that much was obvious&ndash;and she liked it that way. So how, <i>how</i>, did she know someone like him? Were they really that close if you never even heard of a boy Michelle got along with? Or was the secret that unimportant that he could give it away with ease to anyone?&nbsp;</p><p>And if it was the latter, if it truly didn&rsquo;t matter to him that Michelle knew&ndash;why didn&rsquo;t you?&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Sometimes not knowing is better&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Come <i>on</i>,&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t always want to know the truth, Y/N,&rdquo; she emphasized, making you stop. She knew something more, you were certain, and as her face dropped you whipped behind yourself&ndash;catching her line of sight.</p><p>&nbsp; <br /><i>Peter Parker.&nbsp;</i></p><p>Peter Parker listening in to the whole conversation.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Peter Parker looking guilty, and upset, and a quiver of fear in his chin.&nbsp;</p><p>Peter Parker always poking his nose where it shouldn&rsquo;t be.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Peter, what do you want?&rdquo; You let out, shoulders falling as a small whine left your lips. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re having a private conversation here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re yelling in the middle of the hallway,&rdquo; he corrected you, and you shot Michelle a glare as if she was the camera and you were on The Office, before you turned back to him.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Peter Parker, I never know when to respect people&rsquo;s privacy and walk away,&rdquo; you mocked him, voice raising higher as his teeth digged deeper into his thin lip.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re one to talk about respecting privacy,&rdquo; he mumbled, before his eyes shot open and he looked over at Michelle, panic on his freckled face.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What did you say to me?&rdquo; You demanded, and MJ grabbed your hand before the argument could derail any further.&nbsp;</p><p><br />&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; she pushed you towards the exit, before turning back to Peter and whispered, &ldquo;this is why, it&rsquo;s because you <i>never </i>watch what you say around her.&rdquo;</p><h2>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<i><a href=\"https://stuckonspidey.tumblr.com/post/185822612681/we-all-wear-masks-peter-parker-three\"> &nbsp;three</a></i></h2><h2>&#128375;&#128376;&#128375;&#128376;&#128375;</h2><p><i>series taglist; shoot me an ask if you want to be added/removed from the taglist (just saying, if you don&rsquo;t interact with the fic whatsoever i will remove you, the taglist can only be so long and i want to make sure people who are reading can be added!
