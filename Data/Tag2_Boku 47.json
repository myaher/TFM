Death didn\u2019t tell me much else, but we have to get ready,\u201d she paused and turned around to face them, \u201cwe\u2019re the only ones who can stop the incoming evil.\u201d</p><p>Bakugou and Midoriya looked at each other, and looked back, only to find Getsui already heading back towards the camp.

Just for now\u2026 I promise I\u2019ll explain later. Just, please, not right now?\u201d Her voice was small, hinting at her own confusion <strike>and fear</strike>\u00a0at what she had just committed. They both stared at the undead witch, and then the village boy turned to look pleadingly at the violent barbarian.</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cTch, whatever.\u201d Getsui sighed a \u2018thank you\u2019 and continued following behind them while staring at a point in space next to her.</p><p>\u201cNot now.\u201d</p><p>Bakugou turned back to Getsui and told her, \u201cWe know, we get it!\u201d annoyance evident in his voice.</p><p>Mogenei turned to look at him with a face of confusion which quickly changed with some kind of realization. \u201cOh! Sorry, wasn\u2019t talking to you guys.\u201d Izuku and Katsuki looked at her strangely and she quickly corrected herself, \u201cI mean- uhm, you know what, nevermind!\u201d She stared at the ground in embarrassment and shot another glance at the point in space she was so intently watching.</p><p><b></b></p><p>\u201cDid that stupid lizard finish hunting yet?\u201d Katsuki thought aloud as they walked along the trail.

Midoriya and Bakugou were both mortified by the sight of watching Getsui hang by her neck. It certainly wasn\u2019t something they\u2019d forget easily. Yet here she was, walking, talking, breathing, with white hair now, and messing around as if everything was normal. She even cracked a joke about it.</p><p>She looked between the two and realized her mistake. \u201cOh\u2026 sorry, too soon, right?\u201d Katsuki made a sound of disapproval, and Izuku slowly nodded. Mogenei mumbled a lame apology. An awkward silence was about to settle when the sound of distant yells was heard in the direction they were heading.</p><p>\u201cLook! They\u2019re over there!\u201d Kirishima Eijirou began to descend with Knight Iida Tenya on his back. Kirishima was a dragon halfling, being able to alternate between human and dragon forms. In his dragon form, he landed a couple of meters in from of them, and Izuku rushed up to greet them. Katsuki landed with a thud upon being released from Mogenei\u2019s spell, the witch herself walking over the group.</p><p>\u201cGetsui! Are you alright? What happened to your hair?!\u201d Iida asked hurriedly while chopping the air with his arm.</p><p>All eyes were on her, expecting her answer. Mogenei chuckled uncomfortably under the scrutiny of their stares. \u201cAhaa\u2026 uh\u2026 magic?\u201d She held her hands up and wiggled her fingers, hoping they wouldn\u2019t interrogate her further.</p><p>\u201cIt looks cool,\u201d Kirishima, now in human form, complimented with a smile.</p><p>\u201cO-oh. Thanks\u2026\u201d Mogenei, fortunately, did know about a potion that could alter hair color, but it was temporary and faded with time. Still, it was something, for now.</p>",

Midoriya and Bakugou were both mortified by the sight of watching Getsui hang by her neck. It certainly wasn\u2019t something they\u2019d forget easily. Yet here she was, walking, talking, breathing, with white hair now, and messing around as if everything was normal. She even cracked a joke about it.</p><p>She looked between the two and realized her mistake. \u201cOh\u2026 sorry, too soon, right?\u201d Katsuki made a sound of disapproval, and Izuku slowly nodded. Mogenei mumbled a lame apology. An awkward silence was about to settle when the sound of distant yells was heard in the direction they were heading.</p><p>\u201cLook! They\u2019re over there!\u201d Kirishima Eijirou began to descend with Knight Iida Tenya on his back. Kirishima was a dragon halfling, being able to alternate between human and dragon forms. In his dragon form, he landed a couple of meters in from of them, and Izuku rushed up to greet them. Katsuki landed with a thud upon being released from Mogenei\u2019s spell, the witch herself walking over the group.</p><p>\u201cGetsui! Are you alright? What happened to your hair?!\u201d Iida asked hurriedly while chopping the air with his arm.</p><p>All eyes were on her, expecting her answer. Mogenei chuckled uncomfortably under the scrutiny of their stares. \u201cAhaa\u2026 uh\u2026 magic?\u201d She held her hands up and wiggled her fingers, hoping they wouldn\u2019t interrogate her further.</p><p>\u201cIt looks cool,\u201d Kirishima, now in human form, complimented with a smile.</p><p>\u201cO-oh. Thanks\u2026\u201d Mogenei, fortunately, did know about a potion that could alter hair color, but it was temporary and faded with time. Still, it was something, for now.</p>",
