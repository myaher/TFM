        "body": "<div class=\"article-content\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\">There are few things in this world more difficult than launching a successful startup. It takes talent, know-how, money and a hell of a lot of good timing and luck. And even with all of those magical components in place, the odds may still be against you.</p>\n<p>At TechCrunch, we take pride in covering the best and brightest of the startup world. But while covering the startup world is one of the most exciting and fulfilling parts of our job, death is a part of any life cycle. Sadly, not all startups that burn bright ultimately make it. In fact, most don\u2019t.</p>\n<p>As we wrap up this year and look forward to the next, let\u2019s take a moment to remember some of those startups we lost in 2018.</p>\n<h2>Airware (2011-2018)</h2>\n<p><strong>Total Raised: <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/airware\">$118 million</a></strong></p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout\" aligncenter wp-image-1145480 size-full src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/img_9392.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1280\"/></p>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/airware\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"airware\">Airware </a> created a cloud software system to help construction companies, mining operations and other enterprise customers use drones to inspect equipment for damage. It also tried to build its own drones, but found that it couldn\u2019t compete with giants like China\u2019s DJI.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/14/airware-shuts-down/\">The shutdown appears to have been very sudden</a>, coming just four days after Airware opened a Tokyo office, with an investment and partnership from Mitsubishi. In a statement, the company said, \u201cUnfortunately, the market took longer to mature than we expected. As we worked through the various required pivots to position ourselves for long-term success, we ran out of financial runway.\u201d</p>\n<h2>Blippar (2011-2018)</h2>\n<p><strong>Total Raised: <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/blippar\">$131.7 million</a></strong></p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout\" aligncenter wp-image-1495710 size-full src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/blippar-car-recognition-computer-vision-augmented-reality-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"/></p>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/blippar\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"blippar\">Blippar </a> was one of the early pioneers in augmented reality, but unfortunately the AR market has yet to live up to the hopes for mainstream adoption. And despite raising a funding round earlier this year, the startup was apparently losing money quickly as it sought new customers.</p>\n<p>Not helping matters was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/18/after-130m-in-funding-ar-startup-blippar-collapses/\">some shareholder drama</a>, where an emergency influx of $5 million was blocked by Khazanah, a strategic investment fund from the Malaysian government. In a blog post, the company said this was \u201can incredibly sad, disappointing, and unfortunate outcome.\u201d</p>\n<h2>Bluesmart (2013-2018)</h2>\n<p><strong>Total Raised: <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bluesmart#section-overview\">$25.6 million</a></strong></p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout\" alignnone size-full wp-image-1327641 src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20160503-bluesmart31534.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\"/></p>\n<p>One of the major casualties of the FAA\u2019s ban on smart luggage, this New York-based startup was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/01/bluesmart-sells-assets-to-travelpro-following-smart-luggage-ban/\">forced to close its doors in May</a>. CEO Tomi Pierucci was extremely outspoken when airlines started to enforce the new rules early this year, calling the news \u201can absolute travesty.\u201d</p>\n<p>From the standpoint of <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/bluesmart\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"bluesmart\">Bluesmart, </a> he was right. The startup went all-in on connected luggage, and ultimately found it impossible\u00a0to adapt when battery packs were no longer allowed on flights. The startup ended all sales and manufacturing, selling what was left of its tech, designs and IP to luggage giant TravelPro.</p>\n<h2>Doughbies (2014-2018)</h2>\n<p><strong>Total Raised: <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/doughbies\">$760,000</a></strong></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XTRQGsyN874?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" height=\"500px\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Things came crumbling down for San Francisco-based <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/doughbies\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"doughbies\">Doughbies </a> in July, when the 500 Startups-backed, same-day cookie delivery service\u00a0announced it was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/23/cookie-startup-fails-to-rise/\">shutting down immediately</a>. But it wasn\u2019t because the startup ran out of money. Doughbies was actually profitable. Rather, its founders, Daniel Conway and\u00a0Mariam Khan, just wanted to move onto something new.</p>\n<p>TechCrunch\u2019s Josh Constine <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/23/cookie-startup-fails-to-rise/\">argued</a> at the time that Doughbies really didn\u2019t need venture backing and that pressure to deliver adequate returns may have weighed more heavily on Doughbies than it was willing to admit. RIP Doughbies.</p>\n<h2>Lantern (2012-2018)</h2>\n<p><strong>Total Raised: <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/thriveon\">$21.5 million</a></strong></p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout\" alignnone size-full wp-image-1275356 src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/img_1334.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\"/></p>\n<p>Like many failed startups before it, San Francisco-based <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/thriveon\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"thriveon\">Lantern </a> was forced to<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/24/mental-health-startup-lantern-winds-down-its-customer-operations/\"> shutter operations</a> after an acquisition deal fell through. The mental health startup, founded by\u00a0Nicholas Bui LeTourneau and\u00a0Alejandro Foung, had raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/10/mental-health-startup-lantern-raises-17-million-series-a-round/\">millions in venture capital funding</a> from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center\u2019s venture arm, Mayfield and SoftTechVC, but failed to follow through on its promise.</p>\n<p>What was that promise? To offer personalized tools to deal with stress, anxiety and body image based on\u00a0cognitive behavioral therapy techniques via a mobile application. Despite being an early mover in a now overly crowded field of mental wellness apps, Lantern wasn\u2019t able to find enough customers to survive.</p>\n<h2>Lighthouse AI (2014-2018)</h2>\n<p><strong>Total Raised: <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/lighthouse-5#section-overview\">$17 million</a></strong></p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout\" aligncenter wp-image-1488390 size-full src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/lighthouse-package-cover.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"6290\" height=\"4195\"/></p>\n<p>Smart security camera maker Lighthouse AI had a promising product with a natural language processing system that allowed users to navigate their footage. But it also faced a crowded market, and it seems consumers didn\u2019t embrace the product. The company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/18/smart-security-camera-maker-lighthouse-ai-shuts-down/\">announced this month that it\u2019s winding down</a>.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am incredibly proud of the groundbreaking work the Lighthouse team accomplished \u2013 delivering useful and accessible intelligence for our homes via advanced AI and 3D sensing,\u201d wrote CEO Alex Teichman. \u201cUnfortunately, we did not achieve the commercial success we were looking for and will be shutting down operations in the near future.\u201d</p>\n<h2>Mayfield Robotics (2015-2018)</h2>\n<p><strong>Total Raised: N/A</strong></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" size-large wp-image-1541293 src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/kuri-dances.gif?w=640\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\"/></p>\n<p>Mayfield, which was originally part of Bosch, created the adorable home robot Kuri. However, it announced in July that it would stop manufacturing Kuri, and followed with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/21/kuri-maker-mayfield-robotics-will-cease-operations-in-october/\">an announcement that it would cease operations altogether</a>.</p>\n<p>\u201cOur team is beyond disappointed,\u201d the company said in a blog post. \u201cTogether we\u2019ve spent the past four years designing and building not just Kuri, but also an equally incredible company culture and spirit.\u201d</p>\n<h2>Rethink Robotics (2008-2018)</h2>\n<p><strong>Total Raised: <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/rethink-robotics\">$149.5 million</a></strong></p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout\" size-full wp-image-1492683 src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/tcdisrupt-ny17-0153.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"696\"/></p>\n<p>A major player in industrial robotics, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/rethink-4\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"rethink-4\">Rethink </a> was founded by iRobot co-founder Rod Brooks and former MIT CSAIL staff researcher Ann Whittaker. The Boston area startup grew into one of the most important players in both the collaborative and educational robotics space, courtesy of creations like Baxter and Sawyer.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, however, the company served as yet another testament to just how difficult it is to launch a robotics startup. Even with brilliant minds and nearly $150 million in funding, the company couldn\u2019t turn enough profit to stay afloat. A last-minute planned acquisition fell through, and Rethink <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/04/rethink-robotics-closes-after-acquisition-plans-fall-through/\">was forced to close up shop</a> in October.</p>\n<h2>Theranos (2003-2018)</h2>\n<p><strong>Total Raised: <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/theranos\">$1.4 billion</a></strong></p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout\" size-full wp-image-1751912 src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GettyImages-491583120.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"715\"/></p>\n<p>Startup stories don\u2019t come more film-ready than this. Even before it officially closed its doors, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/theranos\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"theranos\">Theranos </a> was set to be the subject of a book, documentary and an Adam McKay-directed feature film starring Jennifer Lawrence as founder Elizabeth Holmes. Holmes founded the company in 2003, promising a breakthrough in blood testing. By age 31, she became the world\u2019s youngest self-made billionaire.</p>\n<p>Theranos would go on to raise $1.4 billion, with a $10 billion valuation at its peak. In 2015, medical professionals began to mount criticism against the company\u2019s methods.

But while covering the startup world is one of the most exciting and fulfilling parts of our job, death is a part of any life cycle. Sadly, not all startups that burn bright ultimately make it. In fact, most don\u2019t.</p>\n<p>As we wrap up this year and look forward to the next, let\u2019s take a moment to remember some of those startups we lost in 2018.</p>\n<h2>Airware (2011-2018)</h2>\n<p><strong>Total Raised: <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/airware\">$118 million</a></strong></p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout\" aligncenter wp-image-1145480 size-full src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/img_9392.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1280\"></p>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/airware\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"airware\">Airware </a> created a cloud software system to help construction companies, mining operations and other enterprise customers use drones to inspect equipment for damage. It also tried to build its own drones, but found that it couldn\u2019t compete with giants like China\u2019s DJI.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/14/airware-shuts-down/\">The shutdown appears to have been very sudden</a>, coming just four days after Airware opened a Tokyo office, with an investment and partnership from Mitsubishi. In a statement, the company said, \u201cUnfortunately, the market took longer to mature than we expected. As we worked through the various required pivots to position ourselves for long-term success, we ran out of financial runway.\u201d</p>\n<h2>Blippar (2011-2018)</h2>\n<p><strong>Total Raised: <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/blippar\">$131.7 million</a></strong></p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout\" aligncenter wp-image-1495710 size-full src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/blippar-car-recognition-computer-vision-augmented-reality-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></p>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/blippar\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"blippar\">Blippar </a> was one of the early pioneers in augmented reality, but unfortunately the AR market has yet to live up to the hopes for mainstream adoption. And despite raising a funding round earlier this year, the startup was apparently losing money quickly as it sought new customers.</p>\n<p>Not helping matters was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/18/after-130m-in-funding-ar-startup-blippar-collapses/\">some shareholder drama</a>, where an emergency influx of $5 million was blocked by Khazanah, a strategic investment fund from the Malaysian government. In a blog post, the company said this was \u201can incredibly sad, disappointing, and unfortunate outcome.\u201d</p>\n<h2>Bluesmart (2013-2018)</h2>\n<p><strong>Total Raised: <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bluesmart#section-overview\">$25.6 million</a></strong></p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout\" alignnone size-full wp-image-1327641 src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20160503-bluesmart31534.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\"></p>\n<p>One of the major casualties of the FAA\u2019s ban on smart luggage, this New York-based startup was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/01/bluesmart-sells-assets-to-travelpro-following-smart-luggage-ban/\">forced to close its doors in May</a>. CEO Tomi Pierucci was extremely outspoken when airlines started to enforce the new rules early this year, calling the news \u201can absolute travesty.\u201d</p>\n<p>From the standpoint of <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/bluesmart\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"bluesmart\">Bluesmart, </a> he was right. The startup went all-in on connected luggage, and ultimately found it impossible\u00a0to adapt when battery packs were no longer allowed on flights. The startup ended all sales and manufacturing, selling what was left of its tech, designs and IP to luggage giant TravelPro.</p>\n<h2>Doughbies (2014-2018)</h2>\n<p><strong>Total Raised: <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/doughbies\">$760,000</a></strong></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XTRQGsyN874?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" height=\"500px\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Things came crumbling down for San Francisco-based <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/doughbies\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"doughbies\">Doughbies </a> in July, when the 500 Startups-backed, same-day cookie delivery service\u00a0announced it was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/23/cookie-startup-fails-to-rise/\">shutting down immediately</a>. But it wasn\u2019t because the startup ran out of money. Doughbies was actually profitable. Rather, its founders, Daniel Conway and\u00a0Mariam Khan, just wanted to move onto something new.</p>\n<p>TechCrunch\u2019s Josh Constine <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/23/cookie-startup-fails-to-rise/\">argued</a> at the time that Doughbies really didn\u2019t need venture backing and that pressure to deliver adequate returns may have weighed more heavily on Doughbies than it was willing to admit. RIP Doughbies.</p>\n<h2>Lantern (2012-2018)</h2>\n<p><strong>Total Raised: <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/thriveon\">$21.5 million</a></strong></p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout\" alignnone size-full wp-image-1275356 src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/img_1334.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\"></p>\n<p>Like many failed startups before it, San Francisco-based <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/thriveon\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"thriveon\">Lantern </a> was forced to<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/24/mental-health-startup-lantern-winds-down-its-customer-operations/\"> shutter operations</a> after an acquisition deal fell through. The mental health startup, founded by\u00a0Nicholas Bui LeTourneau and\u00a0Alejandro Foung, had raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/10/mental-health-startup-lantern-raises-17-million-series-a-round/\">millions in venture capital funding</a> from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center\u2019s venture arm, Mayfield and SoftTechVC, but failed to follow through on its promise.</p>\n<p>What was that promise? To offer personalized tools to deal with stress, anxiety and body image based on\u00a0cognitive behavioral therapy techniques via a mobile application. Despite being an early mover in a now overly crowded field of mental wellness apps, Lantern wasn\u2019t able to find enough customers to survive.</p>\n<h2>Lighthouse AI (2014-2018)</h2>\n<p><strong>Total Raised: <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/lighthouse-5#section-overview\">$17 million</a></strong></p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout\" aligncenter wp-image-1488390 size-full src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/lighthouse-package-cover.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"6290\" height=\"4195\"></p>\n<p>Smart security camera maker Lighthouse AI had a promising product with a natural language processing system that allowed users to navigate their footage.

The company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/18/smart-security-camera-maker-lighthouse-ai-shuts-down/\">announced this month that it\u2019s winding down</a>.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am incredibly proud of the groundbreaking work the Lighthouse team accomplished \u2013 delivering useful and accessible intelligence for our homes via advanced AI and 3D sensing,\u201d wrote CEO Alex Teichman. \u201cUnfortunately, we did not achieve the commercial success we were looking for and will be shutting down operations in the near future.\u201d</p>\n<h2>Mayfield Robotics (2015-2018)</h2>\n<p><strong>Total Raised: N/A</strong></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" size-large wp-image-1541293 src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/kuri-dances.gif?w=640\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\"></p>\n<p>Mayfield, which was originally part of Bosch, created the adorable home robot Kuri.

The Boston area startup grew into one of the most important players in both the collaborative and educational robotics space, courtesy of creations like Baxter and Sawyer.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, however, the company served as yet another testament to just how difficult it is to launch a robotics startup. Even with brilliant minds and nearly $150 million in funding, the company couldn\u2019t turn enough profit to stay afloat. A last-minute planned acquisition fell through, and Rethink <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/04/rethink-robotics-closes-after-acquisition-plans-fall-through/\">was forced to close up shop</a> in October.</p>\n<h2>Theranos (2003-2018)</h2>\n<p><strong>Total Raised: <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/theranos\">$1.4 billion</a></strong></p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout\" size-full wp-image-1751912 src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GettyImages-491583120.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"715\"></p>\n<p>Startup stories don\u2019t come more film-ready than this.

Holmes founded the company in 2003, promising a breakthrough in blood testing. By age 31, she became the world\u2019s youngest self-made billionaire.</p>\n<p>Theranos would go on to raise $1.4 billion, with a $10 billion valuation at its peak. In 2015, medical professionals began to mount criticism against the company\u2019s methods. The following year, the SEC began investigating Theranos, ultimately charging it with \u201cmassive fraud.\u201d In September, the company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/04/wsj-reports-that-theranos-will-finally-dissolve/\">finally called it quits</a>, with Holmes agreeing to pay a $500,000 penalty, while being barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for 10 years.</p>\n<h2>Shyp (2013-2018)</h2>\n<p><strong>Total Raised: <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/shyp#section-overview\">$62 million</a></strong></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1612909\" style=\"width:;\" class=\"wp-caption\" alignnone><img class=\"breakout\" size-full wp-image-1612909 src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/gettyimages-472325468.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">NEW YORK, NY \u2013 MAY 06: Co-founder and CEO of Shyp, Kevin Gibbons speaks onstage during TechCrunch Disrupt NY 2015 \u2013 Day 3 at The Manhattan Center on May 6, 2015 in New York City.

By age 31, she became the world&rsquo;s youngest self-made billionaire.</p>\n<p>Theranos would go on to raise $1.4 billion, with a $10 billion valuation at its peak. In 2015, medical professionals began to mount criticism against the company&rsquo;s methods. The following year, the SEC began investigating Theranos, ultimately charging it with &ldquo;massive fraud.&rdquo; In September, the company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/04/wsj-reports-that-theranos-will-finally-dissolve/\">finally called it quits</a>, with Holmes agreeing to pay a $500,000 penalty, while being barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for 10 years.</p>\n<h2>Shyp (2013-2018)</h2>\n<p><strong>Total Raised: <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/shyp#section-overview\">$62 million</a></strong></p>\n<div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/gettyimages-472325468.jpeg\">External image</div><p>NEW YORK, NY &ndash; MAY 06: Co-founder and CEO of Shyp, Kevin Gibbons speaks onstage during TechCrunch Disrupt NY 2015 &ndash; Day 3 at The Manhattan Center on May 6, 2015 in New York City.

Although a skeleton crew remained employed to finish the work for Netflix, it looks like Telltale is dead.
