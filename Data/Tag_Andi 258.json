Let me see!\u201d </p><p>TJ slid his cup to the boy across from him. \u201cMine\u2019s called, \u2018DJ Fruity\u2019.\u201d </p><p>Inside was a single swirl of plain white tart with an assortment of strawberry, blueberry, and kiwi toppings.</p><p>Cyrus sat back, dramatically clutching a hand to his chest. \u201cDid we just accidentally coordinate our fro yo art though gay subtext, a quirky rhyme, and a soundcloud rapper?\u201d</p><p>TJ cracked up feeling the familiar racing of his heart at Cyrus\u2019s joking remark. \u201cIt\u2019s just so us, isn\u2019t it?\u201d </p><p>The shorter boy followed and bursted next. \u201cThis has been a fantastic start to our day.\u201d </p><p>TJ handed a stainless steel spoon to his boyfriend to enjoy \u201cDJ Fruity,\u201d while he excitedly dug into the pride flag design Cyrus had tailored for him that week. He couldn\u2019t see himself eating frozen yogurt any other way again.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t eat this kind of thing while wearing that.\u201d Cyrus gestured at TJ\u2019s Jefferson Middle School Basketball sweatshirt between bites. \u201cEven though you\u2019re technically not a middle schooler anymore, the ex-captain of the basketball team shouldn\u2019t be getting his team sweatshirt dirty.\u201d</p><p>TJ rolled his eyes playfully, but still stopped to take his sweatshirt off and set it on the seat next to him. In only their second week of dating, he loved that Cyrus\u2019s helpful instinct were amplified around him, and most of the time, he was right. </p><p>TJ asked Cyrus out while they helped set up for Bex and Bowie\u2019s wedding. The gang (him, Cyrus, Andi, Buffy, and Jonah) had free time to kill and Cyrus wanted to show him the Chinese finger trap Andi had in Andi Shack (with her permission, of course). TJ was obviously impressed with the art pieces Andi had laying around, so she slyly suggested that he and Cyrus make something for each other. The time spent alone together as the sun was going down with the fairy lights grazing their heads brought the question out of TJ\u2019s mouth with ease, and they hardly noticed Andi and Buffy peering through the front window as they held each other\u2019s hands and made it official. </p><p>They never ended up making anything for each other with Andi\u2019s supplies the night of the wedding, but her suggestion gave Cyrus the idea for their frozen yogurt swap game at Lemon Berry Yogurt near the Spoon. He thought it would be a good way to to kick off the summer before TJ went to high school.</p><p>TJ looked at the boy across from him. \u201cSo, Underdog. You got any plans after this?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus picked out a blueberry from the top of his tart and popped it into his mouth. \u201cNope. I am all free for whatever you\u2019re about to say next.\u201d TJ raised an eyebrow quizzically. \u201cWait, no. Scratch that. Just tell me what it is first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, don\u2019t worry,\u201d He chuckled and fought a blush. \u201cI was just thinking we could watch a movie at my house,\u201d he asked casually, continuing to eat his yogurt. However, despite the fact that they were dating, he was nervous about this request. The two held hands whenever they could, but cuddling was new, and he knew that a movie on a couch with two boyfriends might lead to that. He thought it would be a fun idea, though, and he hoped that Cyrus was thinking the same.</p><p>A glimpse of hesitation passed over Cyrus\u2019s face, but it was only for a second before his usual upbeat demeanor took over. \u201cYeah.\u201d Cyrus\u2019s eyes twinkled. \u201cYeah, that sounds really good, TJ.\u201d</p><p>There were so many couples at Jefferson that would have dates at fancy restaurants using their parents\u2019 money, or hold hands a certain way because of something they\u2019d seen in a movie. It was all a fantasy to them, acting too old for their age based off of impressions they got of dating that weren\u2019t realistic. TJ couldn\u2019t help but think that what he had with Cyrus was different. It was a middle school relationship where they made up food games and did things their own way, and it was what TJ loved most about them. He valued authenticity in people, and one of his biggest complaints to Cyrus was about how little of that the middle schoolers around them had. </p><p>Suddenly, a brown haired girl shuffling past their booth struck Cyrus\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cIris!\u201d</p><p>She spun around at the sound of her name, which weirdly sounded a lot like Cyrus\u2019s. \u201cCyrus!\u201d she exclaimed back. </p><p>\u201cThe names still sound so satisfying one after the other,\u201d Cyrus remarked as she perched herself at the edge of the boys\u2019 table.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d TJ noticed she was avoiding his gaze. \u201cAnd as always, the observation came from the unique, really just weird, but we\u2019re gonna call it \u201cunique,\u201d mind of Cyrus Goodman.\u201d</p><p>The three of them cracked up at the truth of her statement. Hearing TJ\u2019s laugh reminded Cyrus there was something he still needed to do. </p><p>\u201cOh, TJ, this is my friend, Iris.\u201d She shifted uncomfortably at the mention of her name. \u201dAnd Iris, my boyfriend, TJ.\u201d</p><p>TJ jumped out of the booth so he could stand and extended a hand. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to finally meet you. From what Cyrus told me, you seem really cool.\u201d She looked at him for the first time as she returned the shake. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to sit of you want,\u201d he said, gesturing to his own seat. </p><p>To TJ\u2019s satisfaction, she took the seat he offered. Months ago, Cyrus told him about the high school girl he dated, named Iris, who he broke up with when he realized he was gay. Now, she seemed nervous around the new boyfriend as if she didn\u2019t think she was welcome so he was being as friendly as possible to let her know that it wasn\u2019t the case. </p><p>TJ slid in next to Cyrus across from his original seat and felt him squeeze his hand under the table. Facing them, Iris took bites from her full cup of froyo, already looking more relaxed.</p><p>\u201cThis is probably gonna sound weird.\u201d She spoke after a couple of moments of silence. \u201cBut, sometimes, I like to come here after really sucky days at school and just go at my yogurt like it\u2019s one of my canvasses.\u201d She laughed lightly. \u201cThen, when I\u2019m done, I give it a stupid nickname and I-I don\u2019t know-I just feel a little better. \u201d</p><p>TJ gaped at her and saw that Cyrus shared his expression. This girl they coincidentally ran into today turned out to be just like them. Not gay (but maybe, TJ thought), but appreciating the smaller aspects of life as a way of being themselves.</p><p>Iris chuckled nervously at them. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d </p><p>Cyrus tilted cup forward so she could see the fruit arrangement inside. \u201c\u2018DJ Fruity\u2019, courtesy of TJ Kippen,\u201d he announced.</p><p>TJ looked down in playful embarrassment. \u201cAnd \u2018The Crazy Side of Shadyside\u2019 a la Underdog,\u201d he finished, showing his cup the same way.</p><p>She joined them gawking. \u201cOh my gosh, this is amazing.\u201d She thrusted her rattling cup half full of Skittles under their noses to see. \u201cI named this one \u2018Dino Barf\u2019 coming over here,\u201d she exclaimed with a giggle.</p><p>\u201cTaste the rainbow?\u201d TJ raised an eyebrow and looked at his boyfriend.</p><p>\u201cGay subtext! It even coordinates!\u201d Cyrus exclaimed.</p><p>Iris laughed. \u201cJust promise you guys\u2019ll show me DJ Fruity\u2019s music someday \u2018cause I\u2019m really dying to know what they\u2019re about.\u201d</p><p>Oh boy, she had no idea, thought TJ.</p><p>She sighed to herself and paused. \u201cThis is such a nice break from being around the people at school.\u201d</p><p>TJ noticed Iris often mentioned school in bad ways, whether it was the kind of day she had or the people there. As a soon to be high school freshman, this worried him and he wanted to know more. </p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s the deal high school kids?\u201d he asked.</p><p>This prompted a dry chuckle. \u201cA lot of them are just&ndash;I don\u2019t know&hellip;\u201d She motioned in front of her. \u00a0\u201c&hellip;fake.\u201d</p><p>TJ raised his eyebrows and Cyrus pinched an imaginary tea cup handle and took a \u201csip,\u201d inviting her to continue.</p><p>\u201cLike, I\u2019m an artist, right? And maybe that\u2019s it; that I\u2019m really just complaining over nothing because I need originality and realness around me to feel good about my life, but I\u2019m just sick and tired of everyone thinking they\u2019re more mature because they\u2019re going from meaningless relationship to meaningless relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I get that.\u201d chimed Cyrus.</p><p>\u201cWow, I guess it really doesn\u2019t get better after middle school,\u201d TJ complained. </p><p>Iris took the last bite of her dessert and pushed the empty cup to the side. \u201cYeah, it doesn\u2019t!\u201d She shook her head, still fuming. \u201cBut the absolute worst of them all&hellip;are the jocks.\u201d</p><p>The weight of the room shifted.</p><p>\u201cUm, Ir-\u201d</p><p>TJ darted a look at the boy sitting next to him, stopping him mid sentence. They were going to act cool about this. \u201cWhat about them?\u201d he inquired in his best casual voice. </p><p>Inside, TJ was hurt. This wasn\u2019t the answer he was expecting, but he pushed the issue because he wanted to know everything she knew about the group of kids he was getting into. He loved basketball and was ecstatic that he was guaranteed a spot on the Junior Varsity team as a freshman, but he hated the idea of becoming one of the inauthentic people he always looked down on.</p><p>Cyrus looked at him with a concerned expression, but kept quiet about who TJ was. </p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s a small school, so Amber keeps me up with all the drama,\u201d she prefaced to them. \u201cThe drama that usually happens is that the jock is a straight up jerk to whoever they\u2019re with, and when they break up, they move on crazy quickly.\u201d </p><p>That didn\u2019t sound good at all, but TJ was determined to hold his ground.</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t everyone though, is it?\u201d he argued.</p><p>Iris eyed him suspiciously. \u201cLike I said, it\u2019s a small school, so, pretty much.\u201d she said hesitantly. \u201cThey end up spending so much time with each other, between locker room talk and parties, that the jerk influence just spreads.\u201d </p><p>Was that who he was going to turn into next year? His face reddened at the unsettling thought.</p><p>\u201cBut a lot of them change, right?\u201d piped Cyrus, noticing TJ\u2019s growing discomfort.</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah. They\u2019re still human you know,\u201d she stated obviously and smiled. TJ felt a little relief with this. \u201cBut the thing is that I haven\u2019t seen it happen very much, and neither have a lot of people I know.\u201d She furrowed her brows. \u201cSo, I think it\u2019s safe to say that Grant High School athletes&ndash;past, present and future&ndash;are fake and just plain mean, especially with the people they decide to get into relationships with.\u201d</p><p>TJ couldn\u2019t believe it. There was apparently no good way to look at this and he needed to take his aggressions out on someone. He scowled at Iris. \u201cNo wonder you don\u2019t have any friends. You just think you know everything about athletes, but you don\u2019t!\u201d he snapped, already pushing himself out of the booth.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Iris retorted angrily as he strode away toward the door. </p><p>Cyrus looked extremely worried. He fumbled with both of their empty frozen yogurt cups as he exited the booth in a hurry to catch up with him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Iris. We\u2019ll talk soon, maybe?\u201d he said back to her, tripping over his shoes and following TJ outside.</p><p>Now alone, Iris frantically wondered what she had done to cause this outburst. She felt terrible, especially since it seemed like the three of them were getting along well as a group. Amidst her thought, a light blue, rumpled sweatshirt on the seat next to her caught her eye. She held it up, her jaw dropping as she read the white logo printed across the front. </p>",

There was apparently no good way to look at this and he needed to take his aggressions out on someone. He scowled at Iris. \u201cNo wonder you don\u2019t have any friends. You just think you know everything about athletes, but you don\u2019t!\u201d he snapped, already pushing himself out of the booth.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Iris retorted angrily as he strode away toward the door. </p><p>Cyrus looked extremely worried. He fumbled with both of their empty frozen yogurt cups as he exited the booth in a hurry to catch up with him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Iris. We\u2019ll talk soon, maybe?\u201d he said back to her, tripping over his shoes and following TJ outside.</p><p>Now alone, Iris frantically wondered what she had done to cause this outburst. She felt terrible, especially since it seemed like the three of them were getting along well as a group. Amidst her thought, a light blue, rumpled sweatshirt on the seat next to her caught her eye. She held it up, her jaw dropping as she read the white logo printed across the front. </p></p>",

At this, TJ glanced into his own cup and stifled a laugh.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Let me see!\u201d </p><p>TJ slid his cup to the boy across from him. \u201cMine\u2019s called, \u2018DJ Fruity\u2019.\u201d </p><p>Inside was a single swirl of plain white tart with an assortment of strawberry, blueberry, and kiwi toppings.</p><p>Cyrus sat back, dramatically clutching a hand to his chest. \u201cDid we just accidentally coordinate our fro yo art though gay subtext, a quirky rhyme, and a soundcloud rapper?\u201d</p><p>TJ cracked up feeling the familiar racing of his heart at Cyrus\u2019s joking remark. \u201cIt\u2019s just so us, isn\u2019t it?\u201d </p><p>The shorter boy followed and bursted next. \u201cThis has been a fantastic start to our day.\u201d </p><p>TJ handed a stainless steel spoon to his boyfriend to enjoy \u201cDJ Fruity,\u201d while he excitedly dug into the pride flag design Cyrus had tailored for him that week. He couldn\u2019t see himself eating frozen yogurt any other way again.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t eat this kind of thing while wearing that.\u201d Cyrus gestured at TJ\u2019s Jefferson Middle School Basketball sweatshirt between bites. \u201cEven though you\u2019re technically not a middle schooler anymore, the ex-captain of the basketball team shouldn\u2019t be getting his team sweatshirt dirty.\u201d</p><p>TJ rolled his eyes playfully, but still stopped to take his sweatshirt off and set it on the seat next to him. In only their second week of dating, he loved that Cyrus\u2019s helpful instinct were amplified around him, and most of the time, he was right. </p><p>TJ asked Cyrus out while they helped set up for Bex and Bowie\u2019s wedding. The gang (him, Cyrus, Andi, Buffy, and Jonah) had free time to kill and Cyrus wanted to show him the Chinese finger trap Andi had in Andi Shack (with her permission, of course). TJ was obviously impressed with the art pieces Andi had laying around, so she slyly suggested that he and Cyrus make something for each other. The time spent alone together as the sun was going down with the fairy lights grazing their heads brought the question out of TJ\u2019s mouth with ease, and they hardly noticed Andi and Buffy peering through the front window as they held each other\u2019s hands and made it official. </p><p>They never ended up making anything for each other with Andi\u2019s supplies the night of the wedding, but her suggestion gave Cyrus the idea for their frozen yogurt swap game at Lemon Berry Yogurt near the Spoon. He thought it would be a good way to to kick off the summer before TJ went to high school.</p><p>TJ looked at the boy across from him. \u201cSo, Underdog. You got any plans after this?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus picked out a blueberry from the top of his tart and popped it into his mouth. \u201cNope. I am all free for whatever you\u2019re about to say next.\u201d TJ raised an eyebrow quizzically. \u201cWait, no. Scratch that. Just tell me what it is first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, don\u2019t worry,\u201d He chuckled and fought a blush. \u201cI was just thinking we could watch a movie at my house,\u201d he asked casually, continuing to eat his yogurt. However, despite the fact that they were dating, he was nervous about this request. The two held hands whenever they could, but cuddling was new, and he knew that a movie on a couch with two boyfriends might lead to that. He thought it would be a fun idea, though, and he hoped that Cyrus was thinking the same.</p><p>A glimpse of hesitation passed over Cyrus\u2019s face, but it was only for a second before his usual upbeat demeanor took over. \u201cYeah.\u201d Cyrus\u2019s eyes twinkled. \u201cYeah, that sounds really good, TJ.\u201d</p><p>There were so many couples at Jefferson that would have dates at fancy restaurants using their parents\u2019 money, or hold hands a certain way because of something they\u2019d seen in a movie. It was all a fantasy to them, acting too old for their age based off of impressions they got of dating that weren\u2019t realistic. TJ couldn\u2019t help but think that what he had with Cyrus was different. It was a middle school relationship where they made up food games and did things their own way, and it was what TJ loved most about them. He valued authenticity in people, and one of his biggest complaints to Cyrus was about how little of that the middle schoolers around them had. </p><p>Suddenly, a brown haired girl shuffling past their booth struck Cyrus\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cIris!\u201d</p><p>She spun around at the sound of her name, which weirdly sounded a lot like Cyrus\u2019s. \u201cCyrus!\u201d she exclaimed back. </p><p>\u201cThe names still sound so satisfying one after the other,\u201d Cyrus remarked as she perched herself at the edge of the boys\u2019 table.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d TJ noticed she was avoiding his gaze. \u201cAnd as always, the observation came from the unique, really just weird, but we\u2019re gonna call it \u201cunique,\u201d mind of Cyrus Goodman.\u201d</p><p>The three of them cracked up at the truth of her statement. Hearing TJ\u2019s laugh reminded Cyrus there was something he still needed to do. </p><p>\u201cOh, TJ, this is my friend, Iris.\u201d She shifted uncomfortably at the mention of her name. \u201dAnd Iris, my boyfriend, TJ.\u201d</p><p>TJ jumped out of the booth so he could stand and extended a hand. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to finally meet you. From what Cyrus told me, you seem really cool.\u201d She looked at him for the first time as she returned the shake. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to sit of you want,\u201d he said, gesturing to his own seat. </p><p>To TJ\u2019s satisfaction, she took the seat he offered. Months ago, Cyrus told him about the high school girl he dated, named Iris, who he broke up with when he realized he was gay. Now, she seemed nervous around the new boyfriend as if she didn\u2019t think she was welcome so he was being as friendly as possible to let her know that it wasn\u2019t the case. </p><p>TJ slid in next to Cyrus across from his original seat and felt him squeeze his hand under the table. Facing them, Iris took bites from her full cup of froyo, already looking more relaxed.</p><p>\u201cThis is probably gonna sound weird.\u201d She spoke after a couple of moments of silence. \u201cBut, sometimes, I like to come here after really sucky days at school and just go at my yogurt like it\u2019s one of my canvasses.\u201d She laughed lightly. \u201cThen, when I\u2019m done, I give it a stupid nickname and I-I don\u2019t know-I just feel a little better. \u201d</p><p>TJ gaped at her and saw that Cyrus shared his expression. This girl they coincidentally ran into today turned out to be just like them. Not gay (but maybe, TJ thought), but appreciating the smaller aspects of life as a way of being themselves.</p><p>Iris chuckled nervously at them. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d </p><p>Cyrus tilted cup forward so she could see the fruit arrangement inside. \u201c\u2018DJ Fruity\u2019, courtesy of TJ Kippen,\u201d he announced.</p><p>TJ looked down in playful embarrassment. \u201cAnd \u2018The Crazy Side of Shadyside\u2019 a la Underdog,\u201d he finished, showing his cup the same way.</p><p>She joined them gawking. \u201cOh my gosh, this is amazing.\u201d She thrusted her rattling cup half full of Skittles under their noses to see. \u201cI named this one \u2018Dino Barf\u2019 coming over here,\u201d she exclaimed with a giggle.</p><p>\u201cTaste the rainbow?\u201d TJ raised an eyebrow and looked at his boyfriend.</p><p>\u201cGay subtext! It even coordinates!\u201d Cyrus exclaimed.</p><p>Iris laughed. \u201cJust promise you guys\u2019ll show me DJ Fruity\u2019s music someday \u2018cause I\u2019m really dying to know what they\u2019re about.\u201d</p><p>Oh boy, she had no idea, thought TJ.</p><p>She sighed to herself and paused. \u201cThis is such a nice break from being around the people at school.\u201d</p><p>TJ noticed Iris often mentioned school in bad ways, whether it was the kind of day she had or the people there. As a soon to be high school freshman, this worried him and he wanted to know more. </p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s the deal high school kids?\u201d he asked.</p><p>This prompted a dry chuckle. \u201cA lot of them are just\u2013I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d She motioned in front of her. \u00a0\u201c\u2026fake.\u201d</p><p>TJ raised his eyebrows and Cyrus pinched an imaginary tea cup handle and took a \u201csip,\u201d inviting her to continue.</p><p>\u201cLike, I\u2019m an artist, right? And maybe that\u2019s it; that I\u2019m really just complaining over nothing because I need originality and realness around me to feel good about my life, but I\u2019m just sick and tired of everyone thinking they\u2019re more mature because they\u2019re going from meaningless relationship to meaningless relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I get that.\u201d chimed Cyrus.</p><p>\u201cWow, I guess it really doesn\u2019t get better after middle school,\u201d TJ complained. </p><p>Iris took the last bite of her dessert and pushed the empty cup to the side. \u201cYeah, it doesn\u2019t!\u201d She shook her head, still fuming. \u201cBut the absolute worst of them all\u2026are the jocks.\u201d</p><p>The weight of the room shifted.</p><p>\u201cUm, Ir-\u201d</p><p>TJ darted a look at the boy sitting next to him, stopping him mid sentence. They were going to act cool about this. \u201cWhat about them?\u201d he inquired in his best casual voice. </p><p>Inside, TJ was hurt. This wasn\u2019t the answer he was expecting, but he pushed the issue because he wanted to know everything she knew about the group of kids he was getting into. He loved basketball and was ecstatic that he was guaranteed a spot on the Junior Varsity team as a freshman, but he hated the idea of becoming one of the inauthentic people he always looked down on.</p><p>Cyrus looked at him with a concerned expression, but kept quiet about who TJ was. </p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s a small school, so Amber keeps me up with all the drama,\u201d she prefaced to them. \u201cThe drama that usually happens is that the jock is a straight up jerk to whoever they\u2019re with, and when they break up, they move on crazy quickly.\u201d </p><p>That didn\u2019t sound good at all, but TJ was determined to hold his ground.</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t everyone though, is it?\u201d he argued.</p><p>Iris eyed him suspiciously. \u201cLike I said, it\u2019s a small school, so, pretty much.\u201d she said hesitantly. \u201cThey end up spending so much time with each other, between locker room talk and parties, that the jerk influence just spreads.\u201d </p><p>Was that who he was going to turn into next year? His face reddened at the unsettling thought.</p><p>\u201cBut a lot of them change, right?\u201d piped Cyrus, noticing TJ\u2019s growing discomfort.</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah. They\u2019re still human you know,\u201d she stated obviously and smiled. TJ felt a little relief with this. \u201cBut the thing is that I haven\u2019t seen it happen very much, and neither have a lot of people I know.\u201d She furrowed her brows. \u201cSo, I think it\u2019s safe to say that Grant High School athletes\u2013past, present and future\u2013are fake and just plain mean, especially with the people they decide to get into relationships with.\u201d</p><p>TJ couldn\u2019t believe it. There was apparently no good way to look at this and he needed to take his aggressions out on someone. He scowled at Iris. \u201cNo wonder you don\u2019t have any friends. You just think you know everything about athletes, but you don\u2019t!\u201d he snapped, already pushing himself out of the booth.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Iris retorted angrily as he strode away toward the door. </p><p>Cyrus looked extremely worried.

It even coordinates!&rdquo; Cyrus exclaimed.</p><p>Iris laughed. &ldquo;Just promise you guys&rsquo;ll show me DJ Fruity&rsquo;s music someday &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;m really dying to know what they&rsquo;re about.&rdquo;</p><p>Oh boy, she had no idea, thought TJ.</p><p>She sighed to herself and paused. &ldquo;This is such a nice break from being around the people at school.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ noticed Iris often mentioned school in bad ways, whether it was the kind of day she had or the people there. As a soon to be high school freshman, this worried him and he wanted to know more. </p><p>&ldquo;So, what&rsquo;s the deal high school kids?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>This prompted a dry chuckle. &ldquo;A lot of them are just&ndash;I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;&rdquo; She motioned in front of her. &nbsp;&ldquo;&hellip;fake.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ raised his eyebrows and Cyrus pinched an imaginary tea cup handle and took a &ldquo;sip,&rdquo; inviting her to continue.</p><p>&ldquo;Like, I&rsquo;m an artist, right? And maybe that&rsquo;s it; that I&rsquo;m really just complaining over nothing because I need originality and realness around me to feel good about my life, but I&rsquo;m just sick and tired of everyone thinking they&rsquo;re more mature because they&rsquo;re going from meaningless relationship to meaningless relationship.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I get that.&rdquo; chimed Cyrus.</p><p>&ldquo;Wow, I guess it really doesn&rsquo;t get better after middle school,&rdquo; TJ complained. </p><p>Iris took the last bite of her dessert and pushed the empty cup to the side. &ldquo;Yeah, it doesn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; She shook her head, still fuming. &ldquo;But the absolute worst of them all&hellip;are the jocks.&rdquo;</p><p>The weight of the room shifted.</p><p>&ldquo;Um, Ir-&rdquo;</p><p>TJ darted a look at the boy sitting next to him, stopping him mid sentence. They were going to act cool about this. &ldquo;What about them?&rdquo; he inquired in his best casual voice. </p><p>Inside, TJ was hurt. This wasn&rsquo;t the answer he was expecting, but he pushed the issue because he wanted to know everything she knew about the group of kids he was getting into. He loved basketball and was ecstatic that he was guaranteed a spot on the Junior Varsity team as a freshman, but he hated the idea of becoming one of the inauthentic people he always looked down on.</p><p>Cyrus looked at him with a concerned expression, but kept quiet about who TJ was. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a small school, so Amber keeps me up with all the drama,&rdquo; she prefaced to them. &ldquo;The drama that usually happens is that the jock is a straight up jerk to whoever they&rsquo;re with, and when they break up, they move on crazy quickly.&rdquo; </p><p>That didn&rsquo;t sound good at all, but TJ was determined to hold his ground.</p><p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t everyone though, is it?&rdquo; he argued.</p><p>Iris eyed him suspiciously. &ldquo;Like I said, it&rsquo;s a small school, so, pretty much.&rdquo; she said hesitantly. &ldquo;They end up spending so much time with each other, between locker room talk and parties, that the jerk influence just spreads.&rdquo; </p><p>Was that who he was going to turn into next year? His face reddened at the unsettling thought.</p><p>&ldquo;But a lot of them change, right?&rdquo; piped Cyrus, noticing TJ&rsquo;s growing discomfort.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, yeah. They&rsquo;re still human you know,&rdquo; she stated obviously and smiled. TJ felt a little relief with this. &ldquo;But the thing is that I haven&rsquo;t seen it happen very much, and neither have a lot of people I know.&rdquo; She furrowed her brows. &ldquo;So, I think it&rsquo;s safe to say that Grant High School athletes&ndash;past, present and future&ndash;are fake and just plain mean, especially with the people they decide to get into relationships with.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ couldn&rsquo;t believe it. There was apparently no good way to look at this and he needed to take his aggressions out on someone. He scowled at Iris. &ldquo;No wonder you don&rsquo;t have any friends. You just think you know everything about athletes, but you don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he snapped, already pushing himself out of the booth.</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me?&rdquo; Iris retorted angrily as he strode away toward the door. </p><p>Cyrus looked extremely worried. He fumbled with both of their empty frozen yogurt cups as he exited the booth in a hurry to catch up with him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Iris. We&rsquo;ll talk soon, maybe?&rdquo; he said back to her, tripping over his shoes and following TJ outside.</p><p>Now alone, Iris frantically wondered what she had done to cause this outburst. She felt terrible, especially since it seemed like the three of them were getting along well as a group. Amidst her thought, a light blue, rumpled sweatshirt on the seat next to her caught her eye. She held it up, her jaw dropping as she read the white logo printed across the front. </p></p>",

        "body": "<p>\u201cAmber doesn\u2019t bite so you\u2019ll be fine. Andi\u2019s just being dramatic again,\u201d Cyrus assured Walker, still looking nervous from his interaction with the blonde girl. </p><p>\t\u201cOh, okay.\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cLunch is almost over,\u201d Andi sighed. \u201cYou should probably get to your next class.\u201d </p><p>\tWalker turned to Andi. She didn\u2019t look happy, but Walker\u2019s calc class was nowhere near the cafeteria, so he had to move past. </p><p>\t\u201cCatch up later?\u201d he suggested. </p><p>\tAndi shrugged. Andi must really not like Amber, he thought to himself, but he didn\u2019t wonder why. Something told him that there was something he wasn\u2019t getting, and any theory he had would obviously be wrong. </p><p>\tInstead, he focused on his excitement about his math class. He\u2019d always been good at math after all. He understood math. </p><p>\tWhen he got to his math class, the first thing he noticed was the cute boy sitting in front of the empty seat-the one designated for Walker. He didn\u2019t even catch the boy\u2019s last name. </p><p>\tWalker sat down after a brief introduction from their math teacher. He sat behind Marty and found his heart going baboom-baboom-baboom. </p><p>\tThe teacher began to write an equation out on the board. Suddenly, Marty turned around and Walker got lost in the boy\u2019s dark, peaceful eyes. The ones that for some reason reminded Walker of home. </p><p>\t\u201cDo you have an eraser?\u201d Marty asked. </p><p>\tWalker could feel himself lose his cool. \u201cI would love to.\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cUm?\u201d Marty felt confused. </p><p>Quickly, Walker reached into his bag and tossed Marty an eraser. Marty nodded, feeling a little awkward but he still turned back around. </p><p>Walker\u2019s hand shortly shot up after the teacher finished writing the equation. </p><p>\u201cTwo!\u201d Walker called out. </p><p>The teacher nodded, obviously impressed. It was at that point Walker caught sight of a pretty girl with bouncy black curls partially obscuring her face. She wore a puffy blue jacket with leggings. For a second, Walker couldn\u2019t tell whether she was a nerd or a jock. Then, he noticed her hand shot up as well. </p><p>A nerd. </p><p>\u201cYes, Buffy?\u201d the teacher asked. </p><p>It clicked in Walker\u2019s head. Buffy Driscoll-Andi and Cyrus\u2019s old friend. The one who joined the mathletes and effectively ditched them. She was also cute, something that neither of them had thought to mention. </p><p>At the next problem, Walker blurted the answer at the same time as Marty. </p><p>\u201cTwo over zero is undefined.\u201d </p><p>Marty turned around and they both laughed. </p><p>Walker smiled. </p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re new here?\u201d Marty asked, turning around to talk to Walker again. </p><p>\u201cYeah. I came from Africa. My parents\u2019 ten year timed out and we decided to come back to America. It\u2019s been pretty cool so far. I really love the selfie culture here-and the art supplies\u2026 oh how I\u2019ve missed them\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re an art guy?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah. I love drawing people.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d </p><p>When the bell rang, Walker was going to follow Marty. Perhaps, he would even ask for his cell number and they could chat later. However, that did not happen. What happened was way less exciting. </p><p>Instead, as Marty got up and began to exit, Buffy Driscoll intercepted Walker before he could follow. </p><p>\u201cI would take my time if I were you,\u201d Buffy recommended. \u201cMarty can be\u2026 well\u2026 you guys will surely catch up later. You don\u2019t need to worry. In fact, I even have a proposition for you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d Walker asked, confused. </p><p>\u201cJoin the mathletes!\u201d </p><p>\u201cAndi and Cyrus told me that\u2019s social suicide.\u201d </p><p>Buffy was taken aback. \u201cOh. Well, I\u2019m glad you made friends but mathletes is really fun and with talent like yours\u2026 you\u2019d just be wasting your potential.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI like art. Math\u2026 I\u2019m good at it, but I much prefer joining an art club or something. But I\u2019ll think about it,\u201d Walker decided. </p><p>\u201cWell, here\u2019s my card. Call me if you change your mind,\u201d Buffy handed Walker a small rectangular piece of cardstock. It had Buffy Driscoll printed in ink and everything. Under her name, it said MATHLETES. </p><p>\u201cOkay. Um, anything else?\u201d </p><p>Buffy debated what to say. \u201cUm, you said you were talking to Andi and Cyrus. How are they?\u201d </p><p>Walker didn\u2019t respond. </p><p>Buffy walked away. </p><p>Now, more than anything, Walker hoped that the next day would be normal. </p><p>It wasn\u2019t. </p><p>Walker Brodsky walked into lunch with the unfortunate matter that he couldn\u2019t catch up with Andi and Cyrus. He couldn\u2019t tell them that Buffy had asked about them. Instead, he had lunch with the plastics: Amber, Iris, and Jonah. </p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Amber called, waving. </p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d Jonah turned to Iris, confused. </p><p>\u201cI think his name is Walker. Amber invited him to sit with us.\u201d </p><p>\u201cShe can do that?\u201d Jonah asked. </p><p>Walker quickly found out that Jonah was the dumb, but endearing one of the group. </p><p>Cyrus\u2019s words about Iris as the nice one quickly proved to be true. </p><p>He debated whether Andi was right about Amber or not. </p><p>\u201cSo, you come from Africa right? What\u2019s that like?\u201d Amber asked, twirling her hair. </p><p>\u201cOh you know lots of animals and warm weather and cold nights. I loved it there. I like it here though.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d Jonah said. </p><p>\u201cSo since you\u2019re part of our group now-\u201d Amber started, nudging Iris in the arm.</p><p>Iris and Jonah once again exchanged confused looks. After a moment, they nodded and focused back on Walker. </p><p>\u201cSince you\u2019re part of our group now,\u201d Iris rephrased. \u201cYou should follow our rules&ndash;no,no, you need to follow our rules. Don\u2019t worry, though, they\u2019re not hard to follow. First, no sweatpants. Two, you can only wear your hair in a ponytail once a week but since you\u2019re a boy, that shouldn\u2019t be a problem. Three, on wednesdays, we wear pink so make sure you have some pink in your closet. If not, you could pick something up from the mall today after school. We hang out there almost every day. Four, ex-boyfriends are off limits. I\u2019ve never had one according to Amber. But me and cyrus used to go out but he\u2019s gay now, so he probably shouldn\u2019t count. Jonah\u2019s gone out with tons of girls with a few guys here and there. Five, no hoop earrings.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Walker said, not sure how to react. </p><p>\t\u201cGood,\u201d Amber smiled. \u201cWe\u2019re hitting up the mall after school. Don\u2019t be late.\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cI love your hair. How\u2019d you get it like that?\u201d Jonah asked. </p><p>\tWalker decided to make a joke. \u201cA magician never reveals his secrets.\u201d </p><p>\tJonah aahed. </p><p>\t\u201cWell, lunch is just about over. See you after school Walker.\u201d</p><p>Amber waved Walker off before leaving with Iris on her arm and Jonah trailing behind her. If Walker wasn\u2019t mistaken, it seemed like Iris and Amber were holding hands. </p><p>Walker caught a glance of Marty talking to a jock type looking dude. Walker smiled to himself while scanning the cafeteria for Andi and Cyrus. He didn\u2019t see them. Instead, he also caught a glance of Buffy-the mathlete-and the rest of her crew. </p><p>Time for math, Walker thought to himself. </p>",

Andi\u2019s just being dramatic again,\u201d Cyrus assured Walker, still looking nervous from his interaction with the blonde girl. </p><p>\t\u201cOh, okay.\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cLunch is almost over,\u201d Andi sighed. \u201cYou should probably get to your next class.\u201d </p><p>\tWalker turned to Andi. She didn\u2019t look happy, but Walker\u2019s calc class was nowhere near the cafeteria, so he had to move past. </p><p>\t\u201cCatch up later?\u201d he suggested. </p><p>\tAndi shrugged. Andi must really not like Amber, he thought to himself, but he didn\u2019t wonder why. Something told him that there was something he wasn\u2019t getting, and any theory he had would obviously be wrong. </p><p>\tInstead, he focused on his excitement about his math class. He\u2019d always been good at math after all. He understood math. </p><p>\tWhen he got to his math class, the first thing he noticed was the cute boy sitting in front of the empty seat-the one designated for Walker. He didn\u2019t even catch the boy\u2019s last name. </p><p>\tWalker sat down after a brief introduction from their math teacher. He sat behind Marty and found his heart going baboom-baboom-baboom. </p><p>\tThe teacher began to write an equation out on the board. Suddenly, Marty turned around and Walker got lost in the boy\u2019s dark, peaceful eyes. The ones that for some reason reminded Walker of home. </p><p>\t\u201cDo you have an eraser?\u201d Marty asked. </p><p>\tWalker could feel himself lose his cool. \u201cI would love to.\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cUm?\u201d Marty felt confused. </p><p>Quickly, Walker reached into his bag and tossed Marty an eraser. Marty nodded, feeling a little awkward but he still turned back around. </p><p>Walker\u2019s hand shortly shot up after the teacher finished writing the equation. </p><p>\u201cTwo!\u201d Walker called out. </p><p>The teacher nodded, obviously impressed. It was at that point Walker caught sight of a pretty girl with bouncy black curls partially obscuring her face. She wore a puffy blue jacket with leggings. For a second, Walker couldn\u2019t tell whether she was a nerd or a jock. Then, he noticed her hand shot up as well. </p><p>A nerd. </p><p>\u201cYes, Buffy?\u201d the teacher asked. </p><p>It clicked in Walker\u2019s head. Buffy Driscoll-Andi and Cyrus\u2019s old friend. The one who joined the mathletes and effectively ditched them. She was also cute, something that neither of them had thought to mention. </p><p>At the next problem, Walker blurted the answer at the same time as Marty. </p><p>\u201cTwo over zero is undefined.\u201d </p><p>Marty turned around and they both laughed. </p><p>Walker smiled. </p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re new here?\u201d Marty asked, turning around to talk to Walker again. </p><p>\u201cYeah. I came from Africa. My parents\u2019 ten year timed out and we decided to come back to America. It\u2019s been pretty cool so far. I really love the selfie culture here-and the art supplies\u2026 oh how I\u2019ve missed them\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re an art guy?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah. I love drawing people.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d </p><p>When the bell rang, Walker was going to follow Marty. Perhaps, he would even ask for his cell number and they could chat later. However, that did not happen. What happened was way less exciting. </p><p>Instead, as Marty got up and began to exit, Buffy Driscoll intercepted Walker before he could follow. </p><p>\u201cI would take my time if I were you,\u201d Buffy recommended. \u201cMarty can be\u2026 well\u2026 you guys will surely catch up later. You don\u2019t need to worry. In fact, I even have a proposition for you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d Walker asked, confused. </p><p>\u201cJoin the mathletes!\u201d </p><p>\u201cAndi and Cyrus told me that\u2019s social suicide.\u201d </p><p>Buffy was taken aback. \u201cOh. Well, I\u2019m glad you made friends but mathletes is really fun and with talent like yours\u2026 you\u2019d just be wasting your potential.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI like art. Math\u2026 I\u2019m good at it, but I much prefer joining an art club or something. But I\u2019ll think about it,\u201d Walker decided. </p><p>\u201cWell, here\u2019s my card. Call me if you change your mind,\u201d Buffy handed Walker a small rectangular piece of cardstock. It had Buffy Driscoll printed in ink and everything. Under her name, it said MATHLETES. </p><p>\u201cOkay. Um, anything else?\u201d </p><p>Buffy debated what to say. \u201cUm, you said you were talking to Andi and Cyrus. How are they?\u201d </p><p>Walker didn\u2019t respond. </p><p>Buffy walked away. </p><p>Now, more than anything, Walker hoped that the next day would be normal. </p><p>It wasn\u2019t. </p><p>Walker Brodsky walked into lunch with the unfortunate matter that he couldn\u2019t catch up with Andi and Cyrus. He couldn\u2019t tell them that Buffy had asked about them. Instead, he had lunch with the plastics: Amber, Iris, and Jonah. </p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Amber called, waving. </p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d Jonah turned to Iris, confused. </p><p>\u201cI think his name is Walker. Amber invited him to sit with us.\u201d </p><p>\u201cShe can do that?\u201d Jonah asked. </p><p>Walker quickly found out that Jonah was the dumb, but endearing one of the group. </p><p>Cyrus\u2019s words about Iris as the nice one quickly proved to be true. </p><p>He debated whether Andi was right about Amber or not. </p><p>\u201cSo, you come from Africa right? What\u2019s that like?\u201d Amber asked, twirling her hair. </p><p>\u201cOh you know lots of animals and warm weather and cold nights. I loved it there. I like it here though.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d Jonah said. </p><p>\u201cSo since you\u2019re part of our group now-\u201d Amber started, nudging Iris in the arm.</p><p>Iris and Jonah once again exchanged confused looks. After a moment, they nodded and focused back on Walker. </p><p>\u201cSince you\u2019re part of our group now,\u201d Iris rephrased. \u201cYou should follow our rules\u2013no,no, you need to follow our rules. Don\u2019t worry, though, they\u2019re not hard to follow. First, no sweatpants. Two, you can only wear your hair in a ponytail once a week but since you\u2019re a boy, that shouldn\u2019t be a problem. Three, on wednesdays, we wear pink so make sure you have some pink in your closet. If not, you could pick something up from the mall today after school. We hang out there almost every day. Four, ex-boyfriends are off limits. I\u2019ve never had one according to Amber. But me and cyrus used to go out but he\u2019s gay now, so he probably shouldn\u2019t count. Jonah\u2019s gone out with tons of girls with a few guys here and there. Five, no hoop earrings.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Walker said, not sure how to react. </p><p>\t\u201cGood,\u201d Amber smiled. \u201cWe\u2019re hitting up the mall after school. Don\u2019t be late.\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cI love your hair. How\u2019d you get it like that?\u201d Jonah asked. </p><p>\tWalker decided to make a joke. \u201cA magician never reveals his secrets.\u201d </p><p>\tJonah aahed. </p><p>\t\u201cWell, lunch is just about over. See you after school Walker.\u201d</p><p>Amber waved Walker off before leaving with Iris on her arm and Jonah trailing behind her. If Walker wasn\u2019t mistaken, it seemed like Iris and Amber were holding hands. </p><p>Walker caught a glance of Marty talking to a jock type looking dude. Walker smiled to himself while scanning the cafeteria for Andi and Cyrus. He didn\u2019t see them. Instead, he also caught a glance of Buffy-the mathlete-and the rest of her crew. </p><p>Time for math, Walker thought to himself. </p>",

Yeah. :)) Here goes week 1 ;P</p><p><b>Really just a mess of stuff I want to get out because why not so more under the cut if anyone cares to read\u00a0</b></p><p>WARNING IT TURNED OUT EVEN LONGER THAN I EXPECTED</p><!-- more --><p>\n\n<b>Day 1. How did you first find out about Andi Mack, why did you start watching it, and why did you join the fandom? </b><br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"227\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"david-harbour:Nn2734fB_p_32yUMOltZbg:ZCwsbk2cOQ35s\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8f0d186879fd1f959da31871efa4c8fb/tumblr_pfvwxoAl1X1uum6v8o1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"227\"/></figure><p>I was originally obsessed with Girl Meets World, and when it ended Andi Mack seemed to be starting to gain promotion traction. My cousin had claimed it was Disney trying to find a dramatic replacement for Girl Meets World that wouldn\u2019t meet the standard, and even though I didn\u2019t watch the first ep, she just said it was extremely convoluted and messy (which in all fairness it still kinda was considering everything LOL)</p><p>I only heard things here and there about it until the whole Cyrus lookback scene, where it BLEW UP because of the notion of the first gay character on Disney Channel, so I watched that episode only and found it wasn\u2019t as cringe as my cousin made it out to be. Then I watched s2e1 and OH BOY THE COMING OUT SCENE WAS DONE SO WELL SOFIA AND JOSH OUTDID THEMSELVES. I didn\u2019t really watch AM in its entirety after that, but I saw a good majority of the s2 episodes and saw a bit of Andi Mack related content float around on my dash every now and then. When I saw gifs of an episode, I made sure to watch lol</p><p>I think one day I stumbled across <a>@persongoingfast</a> and was like oh wow one of the stars actually has A TUMBLR and INTERACTS WITH THE FANS A LOT and found out OH WOW ALL OF THEM DO, and I kind of just found it cool and sweet that these guys were so interactive and unashamed of their opinions (not entirely show related) even though they were in the spotlight. So then I got into the friendom and ACTUALLY took the time to watch the series in its entirety from start to finish over the span of TWO DAYS. Then the season 3 trailer came out a little while later and next thing I know I\u2019m stuck here. No regrets.</p><hr><p>\n\n<b>Day 2.

I need to learn how to make gifs one day. Oh, not to mention there are so many edits that are AMAZING.</p><p>Memes, self-explanatory. I get so emo when I show my friends an andi mack related meme only to realize they have no clue what it means, so I just reblog the heck out of everything instead of pestering them LOL.</p><p>And the cast, oh my god they\u2019re all so amazing. I mentioned already how interactive they are, but they\u2019re all just such dorks and I love watching them just have fun with each other doing whatever. If you haven\u2019t seen that video of them just singing along to the intro at the season 1 finale party or something, you really need to it reminds me so much of me and my friends at karaoke and they just look like they\u2019re having sooo much fun. You see how much they care about the show and the fandom and what they\u2019re able to do and it always just makes my day. Technically, they\u2019re the whole reason I started watching the show in the first place. Plus, they\u2019re all so active in trying to do good in this world, and considering they\u2019re so young it\u2019s amazing. Josh\u2019s <i>News in a Rush </i>segments are always a good refresher. Let them still be young and have their fun while respecting them for what they\u2019re doing, because they\u2019re doing AMAZING.\u00a0</p><hr><p>\n\n<b>Day 3.

It\u2019s not only an HOUR so a bunch of stuff was fit into it, you get introduced to the Jonah\u2019s panic attacks storyline, you get introduced to Buffy\u2019s moving away storyline,\u00a0 you get introduced to Walker, you see how Cyrus actually considers TJ someone he liked enough to specifically squeeze him into his party,you see Peyton and Sofia and Josh DANCE, you get to see Cyrus and Jonah hanging out more, you get to see TJ trying to be civilized with Buffy and HONESTLY and OPENLY ask for her help, you get to see TJ interact with Jonah and honestly worry and try to help him (honestly a lot of good character interaction you don\u2019t as often), AND you get to see Cyrus coming out to Andi!!!\u00a0</p><p>&hellip;I feel like I literally summarized the episode, but I mean it was all really good. On top of that, add to the fact that Josh got to experience &lsquo;his\u2019 Bar Mitzvah party since he didn\u2019t get to is a nice touch. Just overall this episode was an amazing balance of fun and introduction to storylines and additions to a lot of character dynamics which was really nice in my opinion. The only things that would\u2019ve made it better is Marty and Amber being there, but it makes sense for them not to since Cyrus wasn\u2019t close to Marty and only knew him through Buffy and he didn\u2019t have those interactions he did with Amber until later on. I just loved this episode so much ;w;</p><hr><p><b>Day 4. If you could change one scene in Andi Mack, which would you change? Why would you change it? And how?</b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"245\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"notsoscarybasketballguy:MqiBN-tVasfP-GB1edVq8g:Z5JKwa2VLPK2O\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a886050e00c730659229f725a1da8f61/tumblr_p4fv7j4uNo1x6b60ao1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"245\"/></figure><p>Okay so there\u2019s technically one scene I want to ADD and one scene I want to CHANGE, which kind of could maybe overlap, but I feel like I need to explain. And funny enough, even though s2e13 was my favorite episode, it\u2019s also the one I want to CHANGE.</p><p>So firstly, the scene I would change is the one where TJ talks to Buffy after asking the fortune teller &ldquo;Do I have a disability.\u201d I think that was a really big and loaded question to ask, and I\u2019m really glad he did ask and got it off his chest. However, I feel really really bad for how Buffy reacted. Don\u2019t get me wrong, she had all the reason in the world to go running trying to figure things out with her own situation, especially considering she wasn\u2019t even that close to TJ, but when I watched it I kind of looked at it in his perspective.</p><p>He was told to let his friend help him, and he thought that was Buffy. She was the one who knew about it, and even though they weren\u2019t considered\u00a0\u2018friends\u2019, he thought she was all he had who could help him. So he actually sucked up his pride in that moment and asked her. And what happened after she, the person who had suggested he had a learning disability, read the card? She didn\u2019t believe it, obviously because of her own situation with the fortune teller. She refused to show him her card when he probably just wanted some justification about whether to believe the fortune teller or not, and up and left him in her own shock. Left his card on the table, and left him sitting there, only to have him pick it up himself and sit there. Alone.</p><p>I don\u2019t know, I feel like I would\u2019ve been completely crushed. I tried to reach out to someone, only to have it shut down. Left all alone with only my thoughts and worries and insecurities over the little question written on the card. That must have SUCKED. I wish they had her at least EXPLAIN she needs to talk to the fortune teller, or she doesn\u2019t know what to think, or say something, ANYTHING, before she just left him there. Or they showed more of his reaction to just being left out to dry like that. Did anyone else try to talk to him after seeing him moping, or did nobody really know him or care? Did he even know anyone else at the party all that well, or was he just there for Cyrus? I do get that it transitioned into showing eventually CYRUS was the woman the fortune teller was talking about but idk, I just wish TJ\u2019s scene had a BIT more closure.</p><p>And that transitions to what I wanted to add. Josh had mentioned there was a scene where TJ had helped Cyrus open a bottle of cider, before leaving and letting Cyrus have all the attention. Like they took the time to show Cyrus explicitly invite TJ to his birthday, only to transition into TJ asking Cyrus about Buffy. Then, they show TJ show up to the party, but Buffy was the only one of the GHC to see him and talk to him. It felt as if the only reason Cyrus invited him was for him to be part of Buffy\u2019s storyline, and the friendship between Cyrus and TJ was just a plot device for that and that alone. Later episodes have a lot more Cyrus and TJ interaction REGARDLESS of Buffy, which I really really love, but by taking out the cider scene, it felt like TJ and Cyrus\u2019s relationship was nothing but a plot device. The only non-Buffy related role TJ played in the episode was the minor role of getting Jonah help. Which again, I appreciated, but I lowkey wish he sat there with Cyrus\u2019s dad and Jonah to make sure Jonah was really okay.\u00a0</p><p>But the cider scene could have happened after the Buffy and TJ talk scene, even though it originally probably didn\u2019t consider the chain of events went from Buffy and TJ to Buffy and the GHC, so TJ and Cyrus wouldn\u2019t have time to interact. But what I could see happening was TJ is dejected after his conversation with Buffy and needs to walk away from the table and get his mind off things. Then he sees Cyrus struggling with something, cheers up at seeing a familiar <i>friendly</i>\u00a0face, goes to wish him a\u00a0happy birthday, and asks him what he\u2019s doing. Then the whole TJ helps him loosen the cap and encourages Cyrus to finish it himself, since he\u2019s always the one encouraging Cyrus to do what he thinks he can\u2019t do, and once Cyrus pops it open, the camera switches back to him smiling, reverse shots to Cyrus being extremely happy and looking at the bottle and with others happy for him before looking back to TJ, only to show TJ is already gone. I think that\u2019d be a really nice scene.</p><p>BOY THAT WAS LONG. But yeah, I think those would be nice changes to the episode. :)</p><hr><p><b> Day 5.

Like, he\u2019s such a friggen DOUCHE in the first few episodes he\u2019s in, and I loved him as an antagonist, then you see more of him and realize he\u2019s actually a pretty cool guy and like?? He just needs friends??? Give him some love???? I never hated him, I always kinda found him cool just like I never hated Amber, I just found her a bit cringe at times with how controlling she was. But I know a lot of people didn\u2019t like him for a while and were shocked when they heard they\u2019d eventually grow to love him and like? Now he\u2019s one of the most popular characters. So WOW</p><p>But really I love how he seemed like the stereotype of the douchebag jock, but then after you see him more he actually subverts that trope. He didn\u2019t teach Cyrus to man up and get a muffin because he didn\u2019t want to be seen getting a muffin for him, he wanted to help him become more confident. He associated himself with Cyrus proudly to defend him when people started acting up. He purposely and willingly approached the\u00a0\u2018nerdy dork\u2019 who was singing a swing song on the swingset, and genuinely asked if he had one for the slide too. He didn\u2019t think he had one, but he wasn\u2019t mocking when he said it. And you can see him deliberately look around the park to look for something to start a conversation with when his eyes land on the slide and he decides to ask if Cyrus has a song for that like. He\u2019s trying to be nice out of his own volition. He was worried and checked up on Jonah when he was having a panic attack because something seemed to be wrong. He legitimately tries to learn and legitimately tried to help Cyrus somersault and legitimately tried to apologize to Buffy and make up for his mistakes.\u00a0</p><p>Not only just that, but he\u2019s dyscalculic and possibly gay representation! Like do you know how amazing it is not only to have a character who has a learning disability explicitly portrayed and verbally named for those who don\u2019t know about it, but also to show them coming to terms with how they are different and that it\u2019s OKAY\u00a0to be different? And on top of that, he\u2019s the\u00a0\u2018cool kid\u2019 and isn\u2019t just a\u00a0\u2018perfect douche\u2019 or an\u00a0\u2018idiot jock\u2019, he\u2019s trying to learn and recognizes there\u2019s something different with him and DOES REACH OUT TO GET HELP! And seeing how people have come to realize they may be dyscalculic after seeing TJ really warms my heart.</p><p><strike>Plus look at how cute he is aksdjsklajdsa\u00a0I\u2019m about Luke\u2019s age I can say that</strike></p><p>But honestly, his scenes are some of my favorite, no matter who he\u2019s interacting with.

She is who I <i>try</i> to be but fail to be. She is such a loyal friend and is honestly someone you never want to make an enemy of, and you know if you\u2019re on her side she won\u2019t let anything bad happen to you. She\u2019s just so FIERCE! I really don\u2019t know what else to say about her, because she\u2019s just so amazing and passionate about everything she does and wants to put her friends first, like have you seen the first episode of season 3? She knows Andi may not take things well, but she likes Walker, so she\u2019s trying to take things slow until she can tell Andi about it like?? WHAT A GOOD FRIEND??</p><p>WHAT. A. QUEEN. And she doesn\u2019t take anything sitting down, just look at how she just kept pushing when the school tried to force the dress code and when TJ tried to shut her down. Can\u2019t quit won\u2019t quit and I definitely need more of that attitude. And even though she knows she\u2019s been mistreated, she tries to be the bigger person and <i>honestly </i>help TJ learn math.

Like you thought Buffy and Marty\u2019s sass together made a powerful duo to be reconned with? Cyrus\u2019s sass plus Marty\u2019s sass would be UNSTOPPABLE. &quot;We\u2019re the good hair crew\u201d and\u00a0\u201cMy friends call me Mr. Party\u201d have the same energy and you really can\u2019t tell me otherwise. I think they\u2019d click pretty easily and bond over their dorky personalities. Plus, they\u2019d probably talk about how much they both love Buffy and how well they know/knew her and can tolerate her quirks and nature. I dunno, I just feel like they would be really cool friends if they got the chance to have proper interactions 1 on 1 rather than just acknowledging each other due to being in the same room as each other while Buffy\u2019s there.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"350\" data-orig-height=\"297\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f22722848e293ce849b15d2381d87970/tumblr_inline_pgk65kmBVJ1uzr9of_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"350\" data-orig-height=\"297\"/></figure><p>I also want to see Marty interact with TJ. I mean, Marty says they\u2019ve had 4 classes with each other yet TJ doesn\u2019t even know his name EVEN THOUGH he was also on the basketball team the previous year. We get a mention of TJ from Marty and they\u2019re in the same scene, yet I could literally not even find a proper shot where they were both in the frame. :( I also really want to see how Marty reacts to the\u00a0\u2018new\u2019 TJ, since TJ not only has become more humble and kind since we last saw Marty, but he\u2019s FRIENDS with one of Buffy\u2019s friends and almost-ish(?) if not already friends with Buffy too. And hey, maybe TJ was just standoffish and does actually know his name, or just never felt the need to use it. After all, a majority of the time he didn\u2019t use Cyrus\u2019s name, he just used nicknames instead. I don\u2019t know, I just want to see them actually interact and have a conversation since Marty seemed to not really enjoy him all that much. We know they\u2019re both on set at the same time in season 3, so maybe we get to see it happen.</p><hr><p>That\u2019s week one of the 31 days.

My cousin had claimed it was Disney trying to find a dramatic replacement for Girl Meets World that wouldn\u2019t meet the standard, and even though I didn\u2019t watch the first ep, she just said it was extremely convoluted and messy (which in all fairness it still kinda was considering everything LOL)</p><p>I only heard things here and there about it until the whole Cyrus lookback scene, where it BLEW UP because of the notion of the first gay character on Disney Channel, so I watched that episode only and found it wasn\u2019t as cringe as my cousin made it out to be. Then I watched s2e1 and OH BOY THE COMING OUT SCENE WAS DONE SO WELL SOFIA AND JOSH OUTDID THEMSELVES. I didn\u2019t really watch AM in its entirety after that, but I saw a good majority of the s2 episodes and saw a bit of Andi Mack related content float around on my dash every now and then. When I saw gifs of an episode, I made sure to watch lol</p><p>I think one day I stumbled across <a>@persongoingfast</a> and was like oh wow one of the stars actually has A TUMBLR and INTERACTS WITH THE FANS A LOT and found out OH WOW ALL OF THEM DO, and I kind of just found it cool and sweet that these guys were so interactive and unashamed of their opinions (not entirely show related) even though they were in the spotlight. So then I got into the friendom and ACTUALLY took the time to watch the series in its entirety from start to finish over the span of TWO DAYS. Then the season 3 trailer came out a little while later and next thing I know I\u2019m stuck here. No regrets.</p><hr><p>\n\n<b>Day 2.

It\u2019s not only an HOUR so a bunch of stuff was fit into it, you get introduced to the Jonah\u2019s panic attacks storyline, you get introduced to Buffy\u2019s moving away storyline,\u00a0 you get introduced to Walker, you see how Cyrus actually considers TJ someone he liked enough to specifically squeeze him into his party,you see Peyton and Sofia and Josh DANCE, you get to see Cyrus and Jonah hanging out more, you get to see TJ trying to be civilized with Buffy and HONESTLY and OPENLY ask for her help, you get to see TJ interact with Jonah and honestly worry and try to help him (honestly a lot of good character interaction you don\u2019t as often), AND you get to see Cyrus coming out to Andi!!!\u00a0</p><p>\u2026I feel like I literally summarized the episode, but I mean it was all really good. On top of that, add to the fact that Josh got to experience \u2018his\u2019 Bar Mitzvah party since he didn\u2019t get to is a nice touch. Just overall this episode was an amazing balance of fun and introduction to storylines and additions to a lot of character dynamics which was really nice in my opinion. The only things that would\u2019ve made it better is Marty and Amber being there, but it makes sense for them not to since Cyrus wasn\u2019t close to Marty and only knew him through Buffy and he didn\u2019t have those interactions he did with Amber until later on.

And funny enough, even though s2e13 was my favorite episode, it\u2019s also the one I want to CHANGE.</p><p>So firstly, the scene I would change is the one where TJ talks to Buffy after asking the fortune teller \u201cDo I have a disability.\u201d I think that was a really big and loaded question to ask, and I\u2019m really glad he did ask and got it off his chest. However, I feel really really bad for how Buffy reacted. Don\u2019t get me wrong, she had all the reason in the world to go running trying to figure things out with her own situation, especially considering she wasn\u2019t even that close to TJ, but when I watched it I kind of looked at it in his perspective.</p><p>He was told to let his friend help him, and he thought that was Buffy. She was the one who knew about it, and even though they weren\u2019t considered\u00a0\u2018friends\u2019, he thought she was all he had who could help him. So he actually sucked up his pride in that moment and asked her. And what happened after she, the person who had suggested he had a learning disability, read the card? She didn\u2019t believe it, obviously because of her own situation with the fortune teller. She refused to show him her card when he probably just wanted some justification about whether to believe the fortune teller or not, and up and left him in her own shock. Left his card on the table, and left him sitting there, only to have him pick it up himself and sit there. Alone.</p><p>I don\u2019t know, I feel like I would\u2019ve been completely crushed. I tried to reach out to someone, only to have it shut down. Left all alone with only my thoughts and worries and insecurities over the little question written on the card. That must have SUCKED. I wish they had her at least EXPLAIN she needs to talk to the fortune teller, or she doesn\u2019t know what to think, or say something, ANYTHING, before she just left him there. Or they showed more of his reaction to just being left out to dry like that. Did anyone else try to talk to him after seeing him moping, or did nobody really know him or care? Did he even know anyone else at the party all that well, or was he just there for Cyrus? I do get that it transitioned into showing eventually CYRUS was the woman the fortune teller was talking about but idk, I just wish TJ\u2019s scene had a BIT more closure.</p><p>And that transitions to what I wanted to add. Josh had mentioned there was a scene where TJ had helped Cyrus open a bottle of cider, before leaving and letting Cyrus have all the attention. Like they took the time to show Cyrus explicitly invite TJ to his birthday, only to transition into TJ asking Cyrus about Buffy. Then, they show TJ show up to the party, but Buffy was the only one of the GHC to see him and talk to him. It felt as if the only reason Cyrus invited him was for him to be part of Buffy\u2019s storyline, and the friendship between Cyrus and TJ was just a plot device for that and that alone. Later episodes have a lot more Cyrus and TJ interaction REGARDLESS of Buffy, which I really really love, but by taking out the cider scene, it felt like TJ and Cyrus\u2019s relationship was nothing but a plot device. The only non-Buffy related role TJ played in the episode was the minor role of getting Jonah help. Which again, I appreciated, but I lowkey wish he sat there with Cyrus\u2019s dad and Jonah to make sure Jonah was really okay.\u00a0</p><p>But the cider scene could have happened after the Buffy and TJ talk scene, even though it originally probably didn\u2019t consider the chain of events went from Buffy and TJ to Buffy and the GHC, so TJ and Cyrus wouldn\u2019t have time to interact. But what I could see happening was TJ is dejected after his conversation with Buffy and needs to walk away from the table and get his mind off things. Then he sees Cyrus struggling with something, cheers up at seeing a familiar <i>friendly</i>\u00a0face, goes to wish him a\u00a0happy birthday, and asks him what he\u2019s doing. Then the whole TJ helps him loosen the cap and encourages Cyrus to finish it himself, since he\u2019s always the one encouraging Cyrus to do what he thinks he can\u2019t do, and once Cyrus pops it open, the camera switches back to him smiling, reverse shots to Cyrus being extremely happy and looking at the bottle and with others happy for him before looking back to TJ, only to show TJ is already gone. I think that\u2019d be a really nice scene.</p><p>BOY THAT WAS LONG. But yeah, I think those would be nice changes to the episode. :)</p><hr><p><b> Day 5. Favorite Character? </b><br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"282\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"tjswings:mT78uw-xgcu3VRO6fuRGWA:Z89eOo2b8jWJ2\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9846f4e7016f05d8d3978f058daa2809/tumblr_pdxec8lkIT1tt356po1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"282\"></figure><p>\u2026is that really a question after a) looking at my name and b) looking at the scene I wanted to change lol</p><p>But yes, it\u2019s the one, the only, the not-so-scary <b>TJ KIPPEN</b></p><p>If I\u2019m being honest, when I was binging the entire show, I was just waiting and waiting and waiting until the episode TJ was finally introduced. Like, he\u2019s such a friggen DOUCHE in the first few episodes he\u2019s in, and I loved him as an antagonist, then you see more of him and realize he\u2019s actually a pretty cool guy and like?? He just needs friends??? Give him some love???? I never hated him, I always kinda found him cool just like I never hated Amber, I just found her a bit cringe at times with how controlling she was. But I know a lot of people didn\u2019t like him for a while and were shocked when they heard they\u2019d eventually grow to love him and like? Now he\u2019s one of the most popular characters. So WOW</p><p>But really I love how he seemed like the stereotype of the douchebag jock, but then after you see him more he actually subverts that trope. He didn\u2019t teach Cyrus to man up and get a muffin because he didn\u2019t want to be seen getting a muffin for him, he wanted to help him become more confident. He associated himself with Cyrus proudly to defend him when people started acting up. He purposely and willingly approached the\u00a0\u2018nerdy dork\u2019 who was singing a swing song on the swingset, and genuinely asked if he had one for the slide too. He didn\u2019t think he had one, but he wasn\u2019t mocking when he said it. And you can see him deliberately look around the park to look for something to start a conversation with when his eyes land on the slide and he decides to ask if Cyrus has a song for that like. He\u2019s trying to be nice out of his own volition. He was worried and checked up on Jonah when he was having a panic attack because something seemed to be wrong. He legitimately tries to learn and legitimately tried to help Cyrus somersault and legitimately tried to apologize to Buffy and make up for his mistakes.\u00a0</p><p>Not only just that, but he\u2019s dyscalculic and possibly gay representation! Like do you know how amazing it is not only to have a character who has a learning disability explicitly portrayed and verbally named for those who don\u2019t know about it, but also to show them coming to terms with how they are different and that it\u2019s OKAY\u00a0to be different? And on top of that, he\u2019s the\u00a0\u2018cool kid\u2019 and isn\u2019t just a\u00a0\u2018perfect douche\u2019 or an\u00a0\u2018idiot jock\u2019, he\u2019s trying to learn and recognizes there\u2019s something different with him and DOES REACH OUT TO GET HELP! And seeing how people have come to realize they may be dyscalculic after seeing TJ really warms my heart.</p><p><strike>Plus look at how cute he is aksdjsklajdsa\u00a0I\u2019m about Luke\u2019s age I can say that</strike></p><p>But honestly, his scenes are some of my favorite, no matter who he\u2019s interacting with.

She is who I <i>try</i> to be but fail to be. She is such a loyal friend and is honestly someone you never want to make an enemy of, and you know if you\u2019re on her side she won\u2019t let anything bad happen to you. She\u2019s just so FIERCE! I really don\u2019t know what else to say about her, because she\u2019s just so amazing and passionate about everything she does and wants to put her friends first, like have you seen the first episode of season 3? She knows Andi may not take things well, but she likes Walker, so she\u2019s trying to take things slow until she can tell Andi about it like?? WHAT A GOOD FRIEND??</p><p>WHAT. A. QUEEN. And she doesn\u2019t take anything sitting down, just look at how she just kept pushing when the school tried to force the dress code and when TJ tried to shut her down. Can\u2019t quit won\u2019t quit and I definitely need more of that attitude. And even though she knows she\u2019s been mistreated, she tries to be the bigger person and <i>honestly </i>help TJ learn math. She may not beat TJ or Cyrus as my favorite characters but dang do I love and adore her. &lt;3</p><hr><p><b>Day 7.

Like you thought Buffy and Marty\u2019s sass together made a powerful duo to be reconned with? Cyrus\u2019s sass plus Marty\u2019s sass would be UNSTOPPABLE. \"We\u2019re the good hair crew\u201d and\u00a0\u201cMy friends call me Mr. Party\u201d have the same energy and you really can\u2019t tell me otherwise. I think they\u2019d click pretty easily and bond over their dorky personalities. Plus, they\u2019d probably talk about how much they both love Buffy and how well they know/knew her and can tolerate her quirks and nature. I dunno, I just feel like they would be really cool friends if they got the chance to have proper interactions 1 on 1 rather than just acknowledging each other due to being in the same room as each other while Buffy\u2019s there.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"350\" data-orig-height=\"297\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f22722848e293ce849b15d2381d87970/tumblr_inline_pgk65kmBVJ1uzr9of_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"350\" data-orig-height=\"297\"></figure><p>I also want to see Marty interact with TJ. I mean, Marty says they\u2019ve had 4 classes with each other yet TJ doesn\u2019t even know his name EVEN THOUGH he was also on the basketball team the previous year. We get a mention of TJ from Marty and they\u2019re in the same scene, yet I could literally not even find a proper shot where they were both in the frame. :( I also really want to see how Marty reacts to the\u00a0\u2018new\u2019 TJ, since TJ not only has become more humble and kind since we last saw Marty, but he\u2019s FRIENDS with one of Buffy\u2019s friends and almost-ish(?) if not already friends with Buffy too. And hey, maybe TJ was just standoffish and does actually know his name, or just never felt the need to use it. After all, a majority of the time he didn\u2019t use Cyrus\u2019s name, he just used nicknames instead. I don\u2019t know, I just want to see them actually interact and have a conversation since Marty seemed to not really enjoy him all that much. We know they\u2019re both on set at the same time in season 3, so maybe we get to see it happen.</p><hr><p>That\u2019s week one of the 31 days.

My cousin had claimed it was Disney trying to find a dramatic replacement for Girl Meets World that wouldn\u2019t meet the standard, and even though I didn\u2019t watch the first ep, she just said it was extremely convoluted and messy (which in all fairness it still kinda was considering everything LOL)</p><p>I only heard things here and there about it until the whole Cyrus lookback scene, where it BLEW UP because of the notion of the first gay character on Disney Channel, so I watched that episode only and found it wasn\u2019t as cringe as my cousin made it out to be. Then I watched s2e1 and OH BOY THE COMING OUT SCENE WAS DONE SO WELL SOFIA AND JOSH OUTDID THEMSELVES. I didn\u2019t really watch AM in its entirety after that, but I saw a good majority of the s2 episodes and saw a bit of Andi Mack related content float around on my dash every now and then. When I saw gifs of an episode, I made sure to watch lol</p><p>I think one day I stumbled across <a>@persongoingfast</a> and was like oh wow one of the stars actually has A TUMBLR and INTERACTS WITH THE FANS A LOT and found out OH WOW ALL OF THEM DO, and I kind of just found it cool and sweet that these guys were so interactive and unashamed of their opinions (not entirely show related) even though they were in the spotlight. So then I got into the friendom and ACTUALLY took the time to watch the series in its entirety from start to finish over the span of TWO DAYS.

It\u2019s not only an HOUR so a bunch of stuff was fit into it, you get introduced to the Jonah\u2019s panic attacks storyline, you get introduced to Buffy\u2019s moving away storyline,\u00a0 you get introduced to Walker, you see how Cyrus actually considers TJ someone he liked enough to specifically squeeze him into his party,you see Peyton and Sofia and Josh DANCE, you get to see Cyrus and Jonah hanging out more, you get to see TJ trying to be civilized with Buffy and HONESTLY and OPENLY ask for her help, you get to see TJ interact with Jonah and honestly worry and try to help him (honestly a lot of good character interaction you don\u2019t as often), AND you get to see Cyrus coming out to Andi!!!\u00a0</p><p>\u2026I feel like I literally summarized the episode, but I mean it was all really good. On top of that, add to the fact that Josh got to experience \u2018his\u2019 Bar Mitzvah party since he didn\u2019t get to is a nice touch. Just overall this episode was an amazing balance of fun and introduction to storylines and additions to a lot of character dynamics which was really nice in my opinion. The only things that would\u2019ve made it better is Marty and Amber being there, but it makes sense for them not to since Cyrus wasn\u2019t close to Marty and only knew him through Buffy and he didn\u2019t have those interactions he did with Amber until later on. I just loved this episode so much ;w;</p><hr><p><b>Day 4. If you could change one scene in Andi Mack, which would you change? Why would you change it? And how?</b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"245\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"notsoscarybasketballguy:MqiBN-tVasfP-GB1edVq8g:Z5JKwa2VLPK2O\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a886050e00c730659229f725a1da8f61/tumblr_p4fv7j4uNo1x6b60ao1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"245\"></figure><p>Okay so there\u2019s technically one scene I want to ADD and one scene I want to CHANGE, which kind of could maybe overlap, but I feel like I need to explain. And funny enough, even though s2e13 was my favorite episode, it\u2019s also the one I want to CHANGE.</p><p>So firstly, the scene I would change is the one where TJ talks to Buffy after asking the fortune teller \u201cDo I have a disability.\u201d I think that was a really big and loaded question to ask, and I\u2019m really glad he did ask and got it off his chest. However, I feel really really bad for how Buffy reacted. Don\u2019t get me wrong, she had all the reason in the world to go running trying to figure things out with her own situation, especially considering she wasn\u2019t even that close to TJ, but when I watched it I kind of looked at it in his perspective.</p><p>He was told to let his friend help him, and he thought that was Buffy. She was the one who knew about it, and even though they weren\u2019t considered\u00a0\u2018friends\u2019, he thought she was all he had who could help him. So he actually sucked up his pride in that moment and asked her. And what happened after she, the person who had suggested he had a learning disability, read the card? She didn\u2019t believe it, obviously because of her own situation with the fortune teller. She refused to show him her card when he probably just wanted some justification about whether to believe the fortune teller or not, and up and left him in her own shock. Left his card on the table, and left him sitting there, only to have him pick it up himself and sit there. Alone.</p><p>I don\u2019t know, I feel like I would\u2019ve been completely crushed. I tried to reach out to someone, only to have it shut down. Left all alone with only my thoughts and worries and insecurities over the little question written on the card. That must have SUCKED. I wish they had her at least EXPLAIN she needs to talk to the fortune teller, or she doesn\u2019t know what to think, or say something, ANYTHING, before she just left him there. Or they showed more of his reaction to just being left out to dry like that. Did anyone else try to talk to him after seeing him moping, or did nobody really know him or care? Did he even know anyone else at the party all that well, or was he just there for Cyrus? I do get that it transitioned into showing eventually CYRUS was the woman the fortune teller was talking about but idk, I just wish TJ\u2019s scene had a BIT more closure.</p><p>And that transitions to what I wanted to add. Josh had mentioned there was a scene where TJ had helped Cyrus open a bottle of cider, before leaving and letting Cyrus have all the attention. Like they took the time to show Cyrus explicitly invite TJ to his birthday, only to transition into TJ asking Cyrus about Buffy. Then, they show TJ show up to the party, but Buffy was the only one of the GHC to see him and talk to him. It felt as if the only reason Cyrus invited him was for him to be part of Buffy\u2019s storyline, and the friendship between Cyrus and TJ was just a plot device for that and that alone. Later episodes have a lot more Cyrus and TJ interaction REGARDLESS of Buffy, which I really really love, but by taking out the cider scene, it felt like TJ and Cyrus\u2019s relationship was nothing but a plot device.

Then he sees Cyrus struggling with something, cheers up at seeing a familiar <i>friendly</i>\u00a0face, goes to wish him a\u00a0happy birthday, and asks him what he\u2019s doing.

He just needs friends??? Give him some love???? I never hated him, I always kinda found him cool just like I never hated Amber, I just found her a bit cringe at times with how controlling she was. But I know a lot of people didn\u2019t like him for a while and were shocked when they heard they\u2019d eventually grow to love him and like? Now he\u2019s one of the most popular characters. So WOW</p><p>But really I love how he seemed like the stereotype of the douchebag jock, but then after you see him more he actually subverts that trope. He didn\u2019t teach Cyrus to man up and get a muffin because he didn\u2019t want to be seen getting a muffin for him, he wanted to help him become more confident. He associated himself with Cyrus proudly to defend him when people started acting up. He purposely and willingly approached the\u00a0\u2018nerdy dork\u2019 who was singing a swing song on the swingset, and genuinely asked if he had one for the slide too. He didn\u2019t think he had one, but he wasn\u2019t mocking when he said it. And you can see him deliberately look around the park to look for something to start a conversation with when his eyes land on the slide and he decides to ask if Cyrus has a song for that like. He\u2019s trying to be nice out of his own volition. He was worried and checked up on Jonah when he was having a panic attack because something seemed to be wrong. He legitimately tries to learn and legitimately tried to help Cyrus somersault and legitimately tried to apologize to Buffy and make up for his mistakes.\u00a0</p><p>Not only just that, but he\u2019s dyscalculic and possibly gay representation! Like do you know how amazing it is not only to have a character who has a learning disability explicitly portrayed and verbally named for those who don\u2019t know about it, but also to show them coming to terms with how they are different and that it\u2019s OKAY\u00a0to be different? And on top of that, he\u2019s the\u00a0\u2018cool kid\u2019 and isn\u2019t just a\u00a0\u2018perfect douche\u2019 or an\u00a0\u2018idiot jock\u2019, he\u2019s trying to learn and recognizes there\u2019s something different with him and DOES REACH OUT TO GET HELP!

Like you thought Buffy and Marty\u2019s sass together made a powerful duo to be reconned with? Cyrus\u2019s sass plus Marty\u2019s sass would be UNSTOPPABLE. \"We\u2019re the good hair crew\u201d and\u00a0\u201cMy friends call me Mr. Party\u201d have the same energy and you really can\u2019t tell me otherwise. I think they\u2019d click pretty easily and bond over their dorky personalities. Plus, they\u2019d probably talk about how much they both love Buffy and how well they know/knew her and can tolerate her quirks and nature. I dunno, I just feel like they would be really cool friends if they got the chance to have proper interactions 1 on 1 rather than just acknowledging each other due to being in the same room as each other while Buffy\u2019s there.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"350\" data-orig-height=\"297\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f22722848e293ce849b15d2381d87970/tumblr_inline_pgk65kmBVJ1uzr9of_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"350\" data-orig-height=\"297\"></figure><p>I also want to see Marty interact with TJ. I mean, Marty says they\u2019ve had 4 classes with each other yet TJ doesn\u2019t even know his name EVEN THOUGH he was also on the basketball team the previous year. We get a mention of TJ from Marty and they\u2019re in the same scene, yet I could literally not even find a proper shot where they were both in the frame. :( I also really want to see how Marty reacts to the\u00a0\u2018new\u2019 TJ, since TJ not only has become more humble and kind since we last saw Marty, but he\u2019s FRIENDS with one of Buffy\u2019s friends and almost-ish(?) if not already friends with Buffy too. And hey, maybe TJ was just standoffish and does actually know his name, or just never felt the need to use it. After all, a majority of the time he didn\u2019t use Cyrus\u2019s name, he just used nicknames instead. I don\u2019t know, I just want to see them actually interact and have a conversation since Marty seemed to not really enjoy him all that much. We know they\u2019re both on set at the same time in season 3, so maybe we get to see it happen.</p><hr><p>That\u2019s week one of the 31 days.

Yeah. :)) Here goes week 1 ;P</p><p><b>Really just a mess of stuff I want to get out because why not so more under the cut if anyone cares to read&nbsp;</b></p><p>WARNING IT TURNED OUT EVEN LONGER THAN I EXPECTED</p><p>\n\n<b>Day 1. How did you first find out about Andi Mack, why did you start watching it, and why did you join the fandom? </b><br /></p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>I was originally obsessed with Girl Meets World, and when it ended Andi Mack seemed to be starting to gain promotion traction. My cousin had claimed it was Disney trying to find a dramatic replacement for Girl Meets World that wouldn&rsquo;t meet the standard, and even though I didn&rsquo;t watch the first ep, she just said it was extremely convoluted and messy (which in all fairness it still kinda was considering everything LOL)</p><p>I only heard things here and there about it until the whole Cyrus lookback scene, where it BLEW UP because of the notion of the first gay character on Disney Channel, so I watched that episode only and found it wasn&rsquo;t as cringe as my cousin made it out to be. Then I watched s2e1 and OH BOY THE COMING OUT SCENE WAS DONE SO WELL SOFIA AND JOSH OUTDID THEMSELVES. I didn&rsquo;t really watch AM in its entirety after that, but I saw a good majority of the s2 episodes and saw a bit of Andi Mack related content float around on my dash every now and then. When I saw gifs of an episode, I made sure to watch lol</p><p>I think one day I stumbled across <a>@persongoingfast</a> and was like oh wow one of the stars actually has A TUMBLR and INTERACTS WITH THE FANS A LOT and found out OH WOW ALL OF THEM DO, and I kind of just found it cool and sweet that these guys were so interactive and unashamed of their opinions (not entirely show related) even though they were in the spotlight. So then I got into the friendom and ACTUALLY took the time to watch the series in its entirety from start to finish over the span of TWO DAYS. Then the season 3 trailer came out a little while later and next thing I know I&rsquo;m stuck here. No regrets.</p><hr /><p>\n\n<b>Day 2. What&rsquo;s your favorite thing about being in the Friendom?&nbsp;</b></p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"1\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>Honestly it&rsquo;s just pretty fun to lurk around in overall, but if I had to choose specifics it&rsquo;d be the beautiful gifsets everyone keeps making, the cast and crew themselves, and&nbsp;<b>the memes</b>. <b>The glorious, glorious memes.</b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6ae1b7a1f9a6ab21a4e724327815322/tumblr_inline_pgjz01lLRk1uzr9of_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>But really, every single gifset I&rsquo;ve seen is amazing, whether it be of ships or friendships or just the cast doing random shiz, they&rsquo;re all so so beautiful. I need to learn how to make gifs one day. Oh, not to mention there are so many edits that are AMAZING.</p><p>Memes, self-explanatory. I get so emo when I show my friends an andi mack related meme only to realize they have no clue what it means, so I just reblog the heck out of everything instead of pestering them LOL.</p><p>And the cast, oh my god they&rsquo;re all so amazing. I mentioned already how interactive they are, but they&rsquo;re all just such dorks and I love watching them just have fun with each other doing whatever. If you haven&rsquo;t seen that video of them just singing along to the intro at the season 1 finale party or something, you really need to it reminds me so much of me and my friends at karaoke and they just look like they&rsquo;re having sooo much fun. You see how much they care about the show and the fandom and what they&rsquo;re able to do and it always just makes my day. Technically, they&rsquo;re the whole reason I started watching the show in the first place. Plus, they&rsquo;re all so active in trying to do good in this world, and considering they&rsquo;re so young it&rsquo;s amazing. Josh&rsquo;s <i>News in a Rush </i>segments are always a good refresher. Let them still be young and have their fun while respecting them for what they&rsquo;re doing, because they&rsquo;re doing AMAZING.&nbsp;</p><hr /><p>\n\n<b>Day 3. Favorite Episode?&nbsp;</b></p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"2\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"3\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>Season 2 Episode 13, the mid-season finale, Cyrus&rsquo; Bash-mitzvah~</p><p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure a lot of people have this as their favorite episode, and for good reason obviously. It&rsquo;s not only an HOUR so a bunch of stuff was fit into it, you get introduced to the Jonah&rsquo;s panic attacks storyline, you get introduced to Buffy&rsquo;s moving away storyline,&nbsp; you get introduced to Walker, you see how Cyrus actually considers TJ someone he liked enough to specifically squeeze him into his party,you see Peyton and Sofia and Josh DANCE, you get to see Cyrus and Jonah hanging out more, you get to see TJ trying to be civilized with Buffy and HONESTLY and OPENLY ask for her help, you get to see TJ interact with Jonah and honestly worry and try to help him (honestly a lot of good character interaction you don&rsquo;t as often), AND you get to see Cyrus coming out to Andi!!!&nbsp;</p><p>&hellip;I feel like I literally summarized the episode, but I mean it was all really good. On top of that, add to the fact that Josh got to experience &lsquo;his&rsquo; Bar Mitzvah party since he didn&rsquo;t get to is a nice touch. Just overall this episode was an amazing balance of fun and introduction to storylines and additions to a lot of character dynamics which was really nice in my opinion. The only things that would&rsquo;ve made it better is Marty and Amber being there, but it makes sense for them not to since Cyrus wasn&rsquo;t close to Marty and only knew him through Buffy and he didn&rsquo;t have those interactions he did with Amber until later on. I just loved this episode so much ;w;</p><hr /><p><b>Day 4. If you could change one scene in Andi Mack, which would you change? Why would you change it? And how?</b></p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"4\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>Okay so there&rsquo;s technically one scene I want to ADD and one scene I want to CHANGE, which kind of could maybe overlap, but I feel like I need to explain. And funny enough, even though s2e13 was my favorite episode, it&rsquo;s also the one I want to CHANGE.</p><p>So firstly, the scene I would change is the one where TJ talks to Buffy after asking the fortune teller &ldquo;Do I have a disability.&rdquo; I think that was a really big and loaded question to ask, and I&rsquo;m really glad he did ask and got it off his chest. However, I feel really really bad for how Buffy reacted. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, she had all the reason in the world to go running trying to figure things out with her own situation, especially considering she wasn&rsquo;t even that close to TJ, but when I watched it I kind of looked at it in his perspective.</p><p>He was told to let his friend help him, and he thought that was Buffy. She was the one who knew about it, and even though they weren&rsquo;t considered&nbsp;&lsquo;friends&rsquo;, he thought she was all he had who could help him. So he actually sucked up his pride in that moment and asked her. And what happened after she, the person who had suggested he had a learning disability, read the card? She didn&rsquo;t believe it, obviously because of her own situation with the fortune teller. She refused to show him her card when he probably just wanted some justification about whether to believe the fortune teller or not, and up and left him in her own shock. Left his card on the table, and left him sitting there, only to have him pick it up himself and sit there. Alone.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know, I feel like I would&rsquo;ve been completely crushed. I tried to reach out to someone, only to have it shut down. Left all alone with only my thoughts and worries and insecurities over the little question written on the card. That must have SUCKED. I wish they had her at least EXPLAIN she needs to talk to the fortune teller, or she doesn&rsquo;t know what to think, or say something, ANYTHING, before she just left him there. Or they showed more of his reaction to just being left out to dry like that. Did anyone else try to talk to him after seeing him moping, or did nobody really know him or care? Did he even know anyone else at the party all that well, or was he just there for Cyrus? I do get that it transitioned into showing eventually CYRUS was the woman the fortune teller was talking about but idk, I just wish TJ&rsquo;s scene had a BIT more closure.</p><p>And that transitions to what I wanted to add. Josh had mentioned there was a scene where TJ had helped Cyrus open a bottle of cider, before leaving and letting Cyrus have all the attention. Like they took the time to show Cyrus explicitly invite TJ to his birthday, only to transition into TJ asking Cyrus about Buffy. Then, they show TJ show up to the party, but Buffy was the only one of the GHC to see him and talk to him.

Like you thought Buffy and Marty&rsquo;s sass together made a powerful duo to be reconned with? Cyrus&rsquo;s sass plus Marty&rsquo;s sass would be UNSTOPPABLE. \"We&rsquo;re the good hair crew&rdquo; and&nbsp;&ldquo;My friends call me Mr. Party&rdquo; have the same energy and you really can&rsquo;t tell me otherwise. I think they&rsquo;d click pretty easily and bond over their dorky personalities. Plus, they&rsquo;d probably talk about how much they both love Buffy and how well they know/knew her and can tolerate her quirks and nature. I dunno, I just feel like they would be really cool friends if they got the chance to have proper interactions 1 on 1 rather than just acknowledging each other due to being in the same room as each other while Buffy&rsquo;s there.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f22722848e293ce849b15d2381d87970/tumblr_inline_pgk65kmBVJ1uzr9of_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>I also want to see Marty interact with TJ. I mean, Marty says they&rsquo;ve had 4 classes with each other yet TJ doesn&rsquo;t even know his name EVEN THOUGH he was also on the basketball team the previous year. We get a mention of TJ from Marty and they&rsquo;re in the same scene, yet I could literally not even find a proper shot where they were both in the frame. :( I also really want to see how Marty reacts to the&nbsp;&lsquo;new&rsquo; TJ, since TJ not only has become more humble and kind since we last saw Marty, but he&rsquo;s FRIENDS with one of Buffy&rsquo;s friends and almost-ish(?) if not already friends with Buffy too. And hey, maybe TJ was just standoffish and does actually know his name, or just never felt the need to use it. After all, a majority of the time he didn&rsquo;t use Cyrus&rsquo;s name, he just used nicknames instead. I don&rsquo;t know, I just want to see them actually interact and have a conversation since Marty seemed to not really enjoy him all that much. We know they&rsquo;re both on set at the same time in season 3, so maybe we get to see it happen.</p><hr /><p>That&rsquo;s week one of the 31 days. I&rsquo;m probably going to do week 2 tomorrow since that&rsquo;s the last day of week 2, and hopefully get on track with answering regularly from then on out. BOY THIS IS LONG BUT I MEAN I had a lot to get off my chest lol</p>",
