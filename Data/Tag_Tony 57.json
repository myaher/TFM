Happy pulled the car next to Tony,\n\u201cget in, kid,\u201d Tony said as he opened the door. </p><p>The ride was silent, \u201clook,\u201d Tony began to say as he broke\nthe silence, \u201cyou don\u2019t have to be sorry. You did the one thing I\u2019ve been wanting\nto do all day but I\u2019ve held back on.\u201d </p><p>\u201cShould\u2019ve let me finish him,\u201d Peter uttered. </p><!-- more --><p>Tony chuckled as he shook his head, \u201cfinish him, do you know\nwhat you sound like?\u201d he sighed, \u201cas much as I would have liked to have seen\nyou \u2018finish him,\u2019 I think it still would\u2019ve been best if we settled this the\nlegal way. Make him an example as to what happens when you mess with Tony Stark.\nAn example as to what should happen if you\u2026\u201d Tony sighed, \u201crape young girls,\u201d\nhe whispered. </p><p>Peter had tears well up in his eyes, \u201chow did she\u2026\u201d He\nsighed as he shook his head from the thoughts that were approaching. </p><p>Tony pinched the bridge of his nose, \u201cshe um, she took some\npills,\u201d He explained. \u201cLuckily, Bucky found her in time.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIs she\u2026 Is she going to live?\u201d </p><p>Tony let out a relieving sigh, \u201cyes.\u201d Peter simply nodded, \u201cdid\nyou really mean it?\u201d Peter looked over at Tony with a confused look, \u201cwhen you\nsaid that you were in love with Olivia\u2026 did you mean it?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to fall in love with her,\u201d he whispered, \u201cbut\nthe way she laughs just tugs my hear closer to her and the way she just looks\nme in the eye as she\u2019s telling a story with such enthusiasm\u2026 I couldn\u2019t help\nit.\u201d Peter sighed, \u201cI would look at her while she got her things ready to get\nout of the car and when she would glance at me I would quickly look away and\nact like I was staring at something. One time she caught me staring at her\nfriend Jasmine, in reality, I was staring at the pole behind the girl, but from\nthere on she thought I liked Jasmine so I took it and played along. It killed\nme to play along.\u201d </p><p>Tony smiled, he hated the thought of his daughter growing up,\nfalling-in-love, and getting married. But the way Peter spoke about Olivia, Tony\nsaw a little of himself in the young man. It reminded him of how he fell in love\nwith Andrea, Olivia\u2019s mother, and even how he fell in love with Pepper. It all\njust happened. Unexpected. </p><p>That\u2019s how love worked after all. Unexcitingly. </p><p>\u201cLiv\u2019s mother was my best friend in college,\u201d Tony shared, \u201cbest\nfriend for years and I understood why most of my relationships never worked, it\nwas because I was in love with her.\u201d Tony sighed, \u201cwhat I\u2019m trying to get at here\nis that\u2026 I\u2019ve been there. But patience is key, kid.\u201d </p><p>Happy pulled up to the hospital, Peter got off right after\nTony. They walked in together, \u201canything?\u201d Tony asked as soon as he walked into\nOlivia\u2019s hospital room. </p><p>Pepper stood up and shook her head, \u201cno, doctors say she probably\nwon\u2019t wake up until tomorrow.\u201d </p><p>Peter slowly made his way over to Olivia\u2019s bed, his heart\nached to see the machines that were notifying everyone in the room that she was\nstill breathing. He gently grabbed her hand, it was cold to the touch, \u201cshe probably\nwon\u2019t wake up until tomorrow, kid,\u201d Tony said softly as he stood next to Peter.\n</p><p>\u201cif it\u2019s alright with you, I\u2019d like to stay until visiting hours\nare over,\u201d Peter stated. </p><p>Tony looked over at Pepper who had tears in her eyes, \u201cyou\nknow it\u2019s alright with me,\u201d Tony said as he looked back over at Peter who\ncontinued to stare at Olivia. </p><p>Peter had kept his promise, he stayed until visiting hours\nwere over. Happy took Peter home, as well as, Pepper who refused at first but after\na small debate she finally caved in. The rest of the team had left a while\nback, mostly giving time for the family to be with Olivia, they would get their\nchance to see her when she woke up. They just wanted to make sure she was going\nto be okay.</p><p>Tony made himself comfortable on the hospital chair next to\nOlivia\u2019s bed, he stared at his daughter laying in that hospital bed. Thinking back\nto when she was born: </p><p><i>\u201cAlright, Mr. Stark,\nyou ready?\u201d The doctor announced as Andrea prepared herself for the last push.\n</i></p><p><i>Tony looked at Andrea in amazement, he kissed her temple, \u201cyou\u2019re doing great,\u201d he whispered. </i></p><p><i>\u201cFuck you,\u201d she\nsnarled. </i></p><p><i>He couldn\u2019t help but\nchuckle, he deserved that, \u201cyeah you did and look where it got us,\u201d he said\nwith a wink.</i></p><p><i>\u201cNow\u2019s not the time!\u201d Andrea yelled.</i></p><p><i>\u201cCount of three,\u201d the\ndoctor stated, \u201cone, two, three, push!\u201d </i></p><p><i>Andrea gave it her all,\nthe sound of a baby crying filled the room. Tony\u2019s heart leaped at the sound, \u201cit\u2019s a girl!\u201d The doctor announced. </i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s a girl!\u201d Tony\nrepeated as he kissed Andrea, \u201cwe have a girl!\u201d Andrea cried tears of joy.</i></p><p><i>Tony quickly walked\nover and watched the nurses clean up his new baby girl, the nurse wrapped her\nin a blanket and gently handed her over to Tony. Tony gently held her as if his\nlife depended on it, \u201coh my gosh,\u201d he whispered, \u201cI love you so much,\u201d he\nstated. Tony looked up at Andrea who\u2019s eyes were locked with her daughter in\nthe arms of her father.</i></p><p><i>\u201cShe\u2019s beautiful,\u201d she\nwhispered.</i></p><p><i>Tony placed another\nkiss on Andrea\u2019s forehead, \u201cthe greatest gift you could ever give me,\u201d he\nwhispered. </i></p><p>Tony leaned over to his daughter and kissed her forehead, \u201cmy\ngreatest gift,\u201d he whispered, \u201cI love you.\u201d </p><p>~~</p><p>Olivia&rsquo;s eyes fluttered open, her breathing quickened, she wasn\u2019t\nsuccessful at her attempt. She let out a soft sob as she sat up on her bed. </p><p>Tony stirred in his sleep, opening his eyes to see his\ndaughter awake, crying, \u201chey,\u201d he whispered as he quickly made his way over to\nher, \u201cshh,\u201d he said as he laid on the bed with her, gently putting her head on\nhis chest as he stroked her hair. </p><p>\u201cI just want to die!\u201d she exclaimed as she cried into her\nfathers chest. </p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Tony whispered as tears welled up in his eyes from\nhearing his own flesh and blood, his own daughter, yell out that she wanted to\ndie. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean that,\u201d he said softly as he placed a kiss on top of her\nhead. </p><p>\u201cYes, I do,\u201d she sobbed. </p><p>Tony sighed and continued stroking her hair, in hopes it\nwould calm her down, \u201cI can\u2019t lose you, Olivia,\u201d he whispered, \u201cI lost your\nmother, my best friend. You\u2019re all I have left of her, of the time I spent with\nher. You mean the world to me, sweetheart and I don\u2019t know what I would do\nwithout you,\u201d Tony choked out, as tears made their way down his cheeks. </p><p>Olivia felt horrible for trying to take her life but felt\nlike her only escape, \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she sobbed, \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d She\nknew her father must have seen the note. </p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve told me about what happened with Bren,\u201d he\ngave Olivia a gentle squeeze on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI was scared,\u201d she whispered as her sobs began to decline. </p><p>Tony shook his head, \u201cscared of what? Me? My reaction?\u201d </p><p>\u201cScared of what you might think of me, of what everyone might\nthink of me.\u201d </p><p>Tony grabbed his daughters face in a gentle way so that she\nwould look at him, \u201cOlivia Maria Stark, I would never think of you as anything\nother than a wonderful, strong, kind, beautiful\u2026 do you want me to keep going\nor are you going to stop me?\u201d </p><p>Olivia chuckled, \u201cI get it,\u201d she whispered. </p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to say is that I will never think bad of\nyou for something you couldn\u2019t control,\u201d Tony gently stroked a strain of hair\nout of Olivia\u2019s face, \u201cI love you and I\u2019m so sorry I wasn\u2019t there to protect\nyou.\u201d </p><p>Olivia felt her eyes water up, she laid her head back onto\nher dad&rsquo;s chest, \u201cI wish you were,\u201d she whispered, \u201cbut you didn\u2019t know, neither\nof us did. We all thought nothing of it.\u201d </p><p>Tony and Olivia sat in silence, eventually, a nurse came in\nand said there were guests waiting in the lobby. Tony left and came back with\nPepper. </p><p>\u201cOh, Olivia!\u201d Pepper exclaimed as tears welled up in her\neyes, she ran over to the young girl that she thought so much as a daughter. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Pepper,\u201d Olivia whispered as Pepper pulled the\nyoung girl into an embrace. </p><p>Pepper shook her head, \u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry, I should\u2019ve listened\nto you.\u201d Olivia wanted to argue but she knew it was no use. </p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s time for our family meeting,\u201d Tony said as he\ntook a seat by his daughter&rsquo;s bed. Pepper did the same on the opposite end.</p><p>\u201cI think we need to start the process of taking this to the court,\u201d Pepper informed.</p><p>\u201cAlright, well, is it too late for a rape kit?\u201d Tony asked\nas he looked at Pepper and Liv. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll just have to as-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI already did one,\u201d Olivia said, interrupting Pepper mid-sentence.\n</p><p>\u201cYou already did a rape kit?\u201d Pepper asked as she gently held\nOlivia\u2019s hand. </p><p>She gave Pepper a nod, \u201cI wanted to make sure I was raped,\u201d\nOlivia whispered, \u201cthe nurse said she\u2019ll hold on to it just in case I ever want\nto use it as evidence.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo, then what are we waiting for? Let\u2019s take this bastard\nto court!\u201d Tony exclaimed as he walked over to his daughter&rsquo;s hospital bed. </p><p>Olivia shook her head, \u201cno,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cNo? Olivia, sweetie, baby, he hurt you. He raped you! He\ncaused you so many years of trauma and what does he get? To live life perfectly\nfine! We have to do something!\u201d Tony explained as he grabbed his daughter&rsquo;s\nother hand, gently giving it a squeeze, \u201cI can\u2019t stand around watching that kid\nlive life knowing damn well he has done horrible things.\u201d </p><p>Tony had a point, \u201cyou\u2019re right,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cSo, which nurse was this?\u201d Pepper asked</p><p>\u201cHer name is

You did the one thing I\u2019ve been wanting\nto do all day but I\u2019ve held back on.\u201d </p><p>\u201cShould\u2019ve let me finish him,\u201d Peter uttered. </p>[[MORE]]<p>Tony chuckled as he shook his head, \u201cfinish him, do you know\nwhat you sound like?\u201d he sighed, \u201cas much as I would have liked to have seen\nyou \u2018finish him,\u2019 I think it still would\u2019ve been best if we settled this the\nlegal way. Make him an example as to what happens when you mess with Tony Stark.\nAn example as to what should happen if you\u2026\u201d Tony sighed, \u201crape young girls,\u201d\nhe whispered. </p><p>Peter had tears well up in his eyes, \u201chow did she\u2026\u201d He\nsighed as he shook his head from the thoughts that were approaching. </p><p>Tony pinched the bridge of his nose, \u201cshe um, she took some\npills,\u201d He explained. \u201cLuckily, Bucky found her in time.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIs she\u2026 Is she going to live?\u201d </p><p>Tony let out a relieving sigh, \u201cyes.\u201d Peter simply nodded, \u201cdid\nyou really mean it?\u201d Peter looked over at Tony with a confused look, \u201cwhen you\nsaid that you were in love with Olivia\u2026 did you mean it?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to fall in love with her,\u201d he whispered, \u201cbut\nthe way she laughs just tugs my hear closer to her and the way she just looks\nme in the eye as she\u2019s telling a story with such enthusiasm\u2026 I couldn\u2019t help\nit.\u201d Peter sighed, \u201cI would look at her while she got her things ready to get\nout of the car and when she would glance at me I would quickly look away and\nact like I was staring at something. One time she caught me staring at her\nfriend Jasmine, in reality, I was staring at the pole behind the girl, but from\nthere on she thought I liked Jasmine so I took it and played along. It killed\nme to play along.\u201d </p><p>Tony smiled, he hated the thought of his daughter growing up,\nfalling-in-love, and getting married. But the way Peter spoke about Olivia, Tony\nsaw a little of himself in the young man. It reminded him of how he fell in love\nwith Andrea, Olivia\u2019s mother, and even how he fell in love with Pepper. It all\njust happened. Unexpected. </p><p>That\u2019s how love worked after all. Unexcitingly. </p><p>\u201cLiv\u2019s mother was my best friend in college,\u201d Tony shared, \u201cbest\nfriend for years and I understood why most of my relationships never worked, it\nwas because I was in love with her.\u201d Tony sighed, \u201cwhat I\u2019m trying to get at here\nis that\u2026 I\u2019ve been there. But patience is key, kid.\u201d </p><p>Happy pulled up to the hospital, Peter got off right after\nTony. They walked in together, \u201canything?\u201d Tony asked as soon as he walked into\nOlivia\u2019s hospital room. </p><p>Pepper stood up and shook her head, \u201cno, doctors say she probably\nwon\u2019t wake up until tomorrow.\u201d </p><p>Peter slowly made his way over to Olivia\u2019s bed, his heart\nached to see the machines that were notifying everyone in the room that she was\nstill breathing. He gently grabbed her hand, it was cold to the touch, \u201cshe probably\nwon\u2019t wake up until tomorrow, kid,\u201d Tony said softly as he stood next to Peter.\n</p><p>\u201cif it\u2019s alright with you, I\u2019d like to stay until visiting hours\nare over,\u201d Peter stated. </p><p>Tony looked over at Pepper who had tears in her eyes, \u201cyou\nknow it\u2019s alright with me,\u201d Tony said as he looked back over at Peter who\ncontinued to stare at Olivia. </p><p>Peter had kept his promise, he stayed until visiting hours\nwere over. Happy took Peter home, as well as, Pepper who refused at first but after\na small debate she finally caved in. The rest of the team had left a while\nback, mostly giving time for the family to be with Olivia, they would get their\nchance to see her when she woke up. They just wanted to make sure she was going\nto be okay.</p><p>Tony made himself comfortable on the hospital chair next to\nOlivia\u2019s bed, he stared at his daughter laying in that hospital bed. Thinking back\nto when she was born: </p><p><i>\u201cAlright, Mr. Stark,\nyou ready?\u201d The doctor announced as Andrea prepared herself for the last push.\n</i></p><p><i>Tony looked at Andrea in amazement, he kissed her temple, \u201cyou\u2019re doing great,\u201d he whispered. </i></p><p><i>\u201cFuck you,\u201d she\nsnarled. </i></p><p><i>He couldn\u2019t help but\nchuckle, he deserved that, \u201cyeah you did and look where it got us,\u201d he said\nwith a wink.</i></p><p><i>\u201cNow\u2019s not the time!\u201d Andrea yelled.</i></p><p><i>\u201cCount of three,\u201d the\ndoctor stated, \u201cone, two, three, push!\u201d </i></p><p><i>Andrea gave it her all,\nthe sound of a baby crying filled the room. Tony\u2019s heart leaped at the sound, \u201cit\u2019s a girl!\u201d The doctor announced. </i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s a girl!\u201d Tony\nrepeated as he kissed Andrea, \u201cwe have a girl!\u201d Andrea cried tears of joy.</i></p><p><i>Tony quickly walked\nover and watched the nurses clean up his new baby girl, the nurse wrapped her\nin a blanket and gently handed her over to Tony. Tony gently held her as if his\nlife depended on it, \u201coh my gosh,\u201d he whispered, \u201cI love you so much,\u201d he\nstated. Tony looked up at Andrea who\u2019s eyes were locked with her daughter in\nthe arms of her father.</i></p><p><i>\u201cShe\u2019s beautiful,\u201d she\nwhispered.</i></p><p><i>Tony placed another\nkiss on Andrea\u2019s forehead, \u201cthe greatest gift you could ever give me,\u201d he\nwhispered. </i></p><p>Tony leaned over to his daughter and kissed her forehead, \u201cmy\ngreatest gift,\u201d he whispered, \u201cI love you.\u201d </p><p>~~</p><p>Olivia\u2019s eyes fluttered open, her breathing quickened, she wasn\u2019t\nsuccessful at her attempt. She let out a soft sob as she sat up on her bed. </p><p>Tony stirred in his sleep, opening his eyes to see his\ndaughter awake, crying, \u201chey,\u201d he whispered as he quickly made his way over to\nher, \u201cshh,\u201d he said as he laid on the bed with her, gently putting her head on\nhis chest as he stroked her hair. </p><p>\u201cI just want to die!\u201d she exclaimed as she cried into her\nfathers chest. </p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Tony whispered as tears welled up in his eyes from\nhearing his own flesh and blood, his own daughter, yell out that she wanted to\ndie. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean that,\u201d he said softly as he placed a kiss on top of her\nhead. </p><p>\u201cYes, I do,\u201d she sobbed. </p><p>Tony sighed and continued stroking her hair, in hopes it\nwould calm her down, \u201cI can\u2019t lose you, Olivia,\u201d he whispered, \u201cI lost your\nmother, my best friend. You\u2019re all I have left of her, of the time I spent with\nher. You mean the world to me, sweetheart and I don\u2019t know what I would do\nwithout you,\u201d Tony choked out, as tears made their way down his cheeks. </p><p>Olivia felt horrible for trying to take her life but felt\nlike her only escape, \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she sobbed, \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d She\nknew her father must have seen the note. </p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve told me about what happened with Bren,\u201d he\ngave Olivia a gentle squeeze on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI was scared,\u201d she whispered as her sobs began to decline. </p><p>Tony shook his head, \u201cscared of what? Me? My reaction?\u201d </p><p>\u201cScared of what you might think of me, of what everyone might\nthink of me.\u201d </p><p>Tony grabbed his daughters face in a gentle way so that she\nwould look at him, \u201cOlivia Maria Stark, I would never think of you as anything\nother than a wonderful, strong, kind, beautiful\u2026 do you want me to keep going\nor are you going to stop me?\u201d </p><p>Olivia chuckled, \u201cI get it,\u201d she whispered. </p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to say is that I will never think bad of\nyou for something you couldn\u2019t control,\u201d Tony gently stroked a strain of hair\nout of Olivia\u2019s face, \u201cI love you and I\u2019m so sorry I wasn\u2019t there to protect\nyou.\u201d </p><p>Olivia felt her eyes water up, she laid her head back onto\nher dad\u2019s chest, \u201cI wish you were,\u201d she whispered, \u201cbut you didn\u2019t know, neither\nof us did. We all thought nothing of it.\u201d </p><p>Tony and Olivia sat in silence, eventually, a nurse came in\nand said there were guests waiting in the lobby. Tony left and came back with\nPepper. </p><p>\u201cOh, Olivia!\u201d Pepper exclaimed as tears welled up in her\neyes, she ran over to the young girl that she thought so much as a daughter. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Pepper,\u201d Olivia whispered as Pepper pulled the\nyoung girl into an embrace. </p><p>Pepper shook her head, \u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry, I should\u2019ve listened\nto you.\u201d Olivia wanted to argue but she knew it was no use. </p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s time for our family meeting,\u201d Tony said as he\ntook a seat by his daughter\u2019s bed. Pepper did the same on the opposite end.</p><p>\u201cI think we need to start the process of taking this to the court,\u201d Pepper informed.</p><p>\u201cAlright, well, is it too late for a rape kit?\u201d Tony asked\nas he looked at Pepper and Liv. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll just have to as-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI already did one,\u201d Olivia said, interrupting Pepper mid-sentence.\n</p><p>\u201cYou already did a rape kit?\u201d Pepper asked as she gently held\nOlivia\u2019s hand. </p><p>She gave Pepper a nod, \u201cI wanted to make sure I was raped,\u201d\nOlivia whispered, \u201cthe nurse said she\u2019ll hold on to it just in case I ever want\nto use it as evidence.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo, then what are we waiting for? Let\u2019s take this bastard\nto court!\u201d Tony exclaimed as he walked over to his daughter\u2019s hospital bed. </p><p>Olivia shook her head, \u201cno,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cNo? Olivia, sweetie, baby, he hurt you. He raped you! He\ncaused you so many years of trauma and what does he get? To live life perfectly\nfine! We have to do something!\u201d Tony explained as he grabbed his daughter\u2019s\nother hand, gently giving it a squeeze, \u201cI can\u2019t stand around watching that kid\nlive life knowing damn well he has done horrible things.\u201d </p><p>Tony had a point, \u201cyou\u2019re right,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cSo, which nurse was this?\u201d Pepper asked</p><p>\u201cHer name is

Happy pulled the car next to Tony,\n\u201cget in, kid,\u201d Tony said as he opened the door. </p><p>The ride was silent, \u201clook,\u201d Tony began to say as he broke\nthe silence, \u201cyou don\u2019t have to be sorry. You did the one thing I\u2019ve been wanting\nto do all day but I\u2019ve held back on.\u201d </p><p>\u201cShould\u2019ve let me finish him,\u201d Peter uttered. </p>[[MORE]]<p>Tony chuckled as he shook his head, \u201cfinish him, do you know\nwhat you sound like?\u201d he sighed, \u201cas much as I would have liked to have seen\nyou \u2018finish him,\u2019 I think it still would\u2019ve been best if we settled this the\nlegal way. Make him an example as to what happens when you mess with Tony Stark.\nAn example as to what should happen if you\u2026\u201d Tony sighed, \u201crape young girls,\u201d\nhe whispered. </p><p>Peter had tears well up in his eyes, \u201chow did she\u2026\u201d He\nsighed as he shook his head from the thoughts that were approaching. </p><p>Tony pinched the bridge of his nose, \u201cshe um, she took some\npills,\u201d He explained. \u201cLuckily, Bucky found her in time.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIs she\u2026 Is she going to live?\u201d </p><p>Tony let out a relieving sigh, \u201cyes.\u201d Peter simply nodded, \u201cdid\nyou really mean it?\u201d Peter looked over at Tony with a confused look, \u201cwhen you\nsaid that you were in love with Olivia\u2026 did you mean it?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to fall in love with her,\u201d he whispered, \u201cbut\nthe way she laughs just tugs my hear closer to her and the way she just looks\nme in the eye as she\u2019s telling a story with such enthusiasm\u2026 I couldn\u2019t help\nit.\u201d Peter sighed, \u201cI would look at her while she got her things ready to get\nout of the car and when she would glance at me I would quickly look away and\nact like I was staring at something. One time she caught me staring at her\nfriend Jasmine, in reality, I was staring at the pole behind the girl, but from\nthere on she thought I liked Jasmine so I took it and played along. It killed\nme to play along.\u201d </p><p>Tony smiled, he hated the thought of his daughter growing up,\nfalling-in-love, and getting married. But the way Peter spoke about Olivia, Tony\nsaw a little of himself in the young man. It reminded him of how he fell in love\nwith Andrea, Olivia\u2019s mother, and even how he fell in love with Pepper. It all\njust happened. Unexpected. </p><p>That\u2019s how love worked after all. Unexcitingly. </p><p>\u201cLiv\u2019s mother was my best friend in college,\u201d Tony shared, \u201cbest\nfriend for years and I understood why most of my relationships never worked, it\nwas because I was in love with her.\u201d Tony sighed, \u201cwhat I\u2019m trying to get at here\nis that\u2026 I\u2019ve been there. But patience is key, kid.\u201d </p><p>Happy pulled up to the hospital, Peter got off right after\nTony. They walked in together, \u201canything?\u201d Tony asked as soon as he walked into\nOlivia\u2019s hospital room. </p><p>Pepper stood up and shook her head, \u201cno, doctors say she probably\nwon\u2019t wake up until tomorrow.\u201d </p><p>Peter slowly made his way over to Olivia\u2019s bed, his heart\nached to see the machines that were notifying everyone in the room that she was\nstill breathing. He gently grabbed her hand, it was cold to the touch, \u201cshe probably\nwon\u2019t wake up until tomorrow, kid,\u201d Tony said softly as he stood next to Peter.\n</p><p>\u201cif it\u2019s alright with you, I\u2019d like to stay until visiting hours\nare over,\u201d Peter stated. </p><p>Tony looked over at Pepper who had tears in her eyes, \u201cyou\nknow it\u2019s alright with me,\u201d Tony said as he looked back over at Peter who\ncontinued to stare at Olivia. </p><p>Peter had kept his promise, he stayed until visiting hours\nwere over. Happy took Peter home, as well as, Pepper who refused at first but after\na small debate she finally caved in. The rest of the team had left a while\nback, mostly giving time for the family to be with Olivia, they would get their\nchance to see her when she woke up. They just wanted to make sure she was going\nto be okay.</p><p>Tony made himself comfortable on the hospital chair next to\nOlivia\u2019s bed, he stared at his daughter laying in that hospital bed. Thinking back\nto when she was born: </p><p><i>\u201cAlright, Mr. Stark,\nyou ready?\u201d The doctor announced as Andrea prepared herself for the last push.\n</i></p><p><i>Tony looked at Andrea in amazement, he kissed her temple, \u201cyou\u2019re doing great,\u201d he whispered. </i></p><p><i>\u201cFuck you,\u201d she\nsnarled. </i></p><p><i>He couldn\u2019t help but\nchuckle, he deserved that, \u201cyeah you did and look where it got us,\u201d he said\nwith a wink.</i></p><p><i>\u201cNow\u2019s not the time!\u201d Andrea yelled.</i></p><p><i>\u201cCount of three,\u201d the\ndoctor stated, \u201cone, two, three, push!\u201d </i></p><p><i>Andrea gave it her all,\nthe sound of a baby crying filled the room. Tony\u2019s heart leaped at the sound, \u201cit\u2019s a girl!\u201d The doctor announced. </i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s a girl!\u201d Tony\nrepeated as he kissed Andrea, \u201cwe have a girl!\u201d Andrea cried tears of joy.</i></p><p><i>Tony quickly walked\nover and watched the nurses clean up his new baby girl, the nurse wrapped her\nin a blanket and gently handed her over to Tony. Tony gently held her as if his\nlife depended on it, \u201coh my gosh,\u201d he whispered, \u201cI love you so much,\u201d he\nstated. Tony looked up at Andrea who\u2019s eyes were locked with her daughter in\nthe arms of her father.</i></p><p><i>\u201cShe\u2019s beautiful,\u201d she\nwhispered.</i></p><p><i>Tony placed another\nkiss on Andrea\u2019s forehead, \u201cthe greatest gift you could ever give me,\u201d he\nwhispered. </i></p><p>Tony leaned over to his daughter and kissed her forehead, \u201cmy\ngreatest gift,\u201d he whispered, \u201cI love you.\u201d </p><p>~~</p><p>Olivia\u2019s eyes fluttered open, her breathing quickened, she wasn\u2019t\nsuccessful at her attempt. She let out a soft sob as she sat up on her bed. </p><p>Tony stirred in his sleep, opening his eyes to see his\ndaughter awake, crying, \u201chey,\u201d he whispered as he quickly made his way over to\nher, \u201cshh,\u201d he said as he laid on the bed with her, gently putting her head on\nhis chest as he stroked her hair. </p><p>\u201cI just want to die!\u201d she exclaimed as she cried into her\nfathers chest. </p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Tony whispered as tears welled up in his eyes from\nhearing his own flesh and blood, his own daughter, yell out that she wanted to\ndie. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean that,\u201d he said softly as he placed a kiss on top of her\nhead. </p><p>\u201cYes, I do,\u201d she sobbed. </p><p>Tony sighed and continued stroking her hair, in hopes it\nwould calm her down, \u201cI can\u2019t lose you, Olivia,\u201d he whispered, \u201cI lost your\nmother, my best friend. You\u2019re all I have left of her, of the time I spent with\nher. You mean the world to me, sweetheart and I don\u2019t know what I would do\nwithout you,\u201d Tony choked out, as tears made their way down his cheeks. </p><p>Olivia felt horrible for trying to take her life but felt\nlike her only escape, \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she sobbed, \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d She\nknew her father must have seen the note. </p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve told me about what happened with Bren,\u201d he\ngave Olivia a gentle squeeze on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI was scared,\u201d she whispered as her sobs began to decline. </p><p>Tony shook his head, \u201cscared of what? Me? My reaction?\u201d </p><p>\u201cScared of what you might think of me, of what everyone might\nthink of me.\u201d </p><p>Tony grabbed his daughters face in a gentle way so that she\nwould look at him, \u201cOlivia Maria Stark, I would never think of you as anything\nother than a wonderful, strong, kind, beautiful\u2026 do you want me to keep going\nor are you going to stop me?\u201d </p><p>Olivia chuckled, \u201cI get it,\u201d she whispered. </p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to say is that I will never think bad of\nyou for something you couldn\u2019t control,\u201d Tony gently stroked a strain of hair\nout of Olivia\u2019s face, \u201cI love you and I\u2019m so sorry I wasn\u2019t there to protect\nyou.\u201d </p><p>Olivia felt her eyes water up, she laid her head back onto\nher dad\u2019s chest, \u201cI wish you were,\u201d she whispered, \u201cbut you didn\u2019t know, neither\nof us did. We all thought nothing of it.\u201d </p><p>Tony and Olivia sat in silence, eventually, a nurse came in\nand said there were guests waiting in the lobby. Tony left and came back with\nPepper. </p><p>\u201cOh, Olivia!\u201d Pepper exclaimed as tears welled up in her\neyes, she ran over to the young girl that she thought so much as a daughter. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Pepper,\u201d Olivia whispered as Pepper pulled the\nyoung girl into an embrace. </p><p>Pepper shook her head, \u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry, I should\u2019ve listened\nto you.\u201d Olivia wanted to argue but she knew it was no use. </p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s time for our family meeting,\u201d Tony said as he\ntook a seat by his daughter\u2019s bed. Pepper did the same on the opposite end.</p><p>\u201cI think we need to start the process of taking this to the court,\u201d Pepper informed.</p><p>\u201cAlright, well, is it too late for a rape kit?\u201d Tony asked\nas he looked at Pepper and Liv. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll just have to as-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI already did one,\u201d Olivia said, interrupting Pepper mid-sentence.\n</p><p>\u201cYou already did a rape kit?\u201d Pepper asked as she gently held\nOlivia\u2019s hand. </p><p>She gave Pepper a nod, \u201cI wanted to make sure I was raped,\u201d\nOlivia whispered, \u201cthe nurse said she\u2019ll hold on to it just in case I ever want\nto use it as evidence.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo, then what are we waiting for? Let\u2019s take this bastard\nto court!\u201d Tony exclaimed as he walked over to his daughter\u2019s hospital bed. </p><p>Olivia shook her head, \u201cno,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cNo? Olivia, sweetie, baby, he hurt you. He raped you! He\ncaused you so many years of trauma and what does he get? To live life perfectly\nfine! We have to do something!\u201d Tony explained as he grabbed his daughter\u2019s\nother hand, gently giving it a squeeze, \u201cI can\u2019t stand around watching that kid\nlive life knowing damn well he has done horrible things.\u201d </p><p>Tony had a point, \u201cyou\u2019re right,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cSo, which nurse was this?\u201d Pepper asked</p><p>\u201cHer name is

Happy pulled the car next to Tony,\n&ldquo;get in, kid,&rdquo; Tony said as he opened the door. </p><p>The ride was silent, &ldquo;look,&rdquo; Tony began to say as he broke\nthe silence, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t have to be sorry. You did the one thing I&rsquo;ve been wanting\nto do all day but I&rsquo;ve held back on.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Should&rsquo;ve let me finish him,&rdquo; Peter uttered. </p><p>Tony chuckled as he shook his head, &ldquo;finish him, do you know\nwhat you sound like?&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;as much as I would have liked to have seen\nyou &lsquo;finish him,&rsquo; I think it still would&rsquo;ve been best if we settled this the\nlegal way. Make him an example as to what happens when you mess with Tony Stark.\nAn example as to what should happen if you&hellip;&rdquo; Tony sighed, &ldquo;rape young girls,&rdquo;\nhe whispered. </p><p>Peter had tears well up in his eyes, &ldquo;how did she&hellip;&rdquo; He\nsighed as he shook his head from the thoughts that were approaching. </p><p>Tony pinched the bridge of his nose, &ldquo;she um, she took some\npills,&rdquo; He explained. &ldquo;Luckily, Bucky found her in time.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Is she&hellip; Is she going to live?&rdquo; </p><p>Tony let out a relieving sigh, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; Peter simply nodded, &ldquo;did\nyou really mean it?&rdquo; Peter looked over at Tony with a confused look, &ldquo;when you\nsaid that you were in love with Olivia&hellip; did you mean it?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to fall in love with her,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;but\nthe way she laughs just tugs my hear closer to her and the way she just looks\nme in the eye as she&rsquo;s telling a story with such enthusiasm&hellip; I couldn&rsquo;t help\nit.&rdquo; Peter sighed, &ldquo;I would look at her while she got her things ready to get\nout of the car and when she would glance at me I would quickly look away and\nact like I was staring at something. One time she caught me staring at her\nfriend Jasmine, in reality, I was staring at the pole behind the girl, but from\nthere on she thought I liked Jasmine so I took it and played along. It killed\nme to play along.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony smiled, he hated the thought of his daughter growing up,\nfalling-in-love, and getting married. But the way Peter spoke about Olivia, Tony\nsaw a little of himself in the young man. It reminded him of how he fell in love\nwith Andrea, Olivia&rsquo;s mother, and even how he fell in love with Pepper. It all\njust happened. Unexpected. </p><p>That&rsquo;s how love worked after all. Unexcitingly. </p><p>&ldquo;Liv&rsquo;s mother was my best friend in college,&rdquo; Tony shared, &ldquo;best\nfriend for years and I understood why most of my relationships never worked, it\nwas because I was in love with her.&rdquo; Tony sighed, &ldquo;what I&rsquo;m trying to get at here\nis that&hellip; I&rsquo;ve been there. But patience is key, kid.&rdquo; </p><p>Happy pulled up to the hospital, Peter got off right after\nTony. They walked in together, &ldquo;anything?&rdquo; Tony asked as soon as he walked into\nOlivia&rsquo;s hospital room. </p><p>Pepper stood up and shook her head, &ldquo;no, doctors say she probably\nwon&rsquo;t wake up until tomorrow.&rdquo; </p><p>Peter slowly made his way over to Olivia&rsquo;s bed, his heart\nached to see the machines that were notifying everyone in the room that she was\nstill breathing. He gently grabbed her hand, it was cold to the touch, &ldquo;she probably\nwon&rsquo;t wake up until tomorrow, kid,&rdquo; Tony said softly as he stood next to Peter.\n</p><p>&ldquo;if it&rsquo;s alright with you, I&rsquo;d like to stay until visiting hours\nare over,&rdquo; Peter stated. </p><p>Tony looked over at Pepper who had tears in her eyes, &ldquo;you\nknow it&rsquo;s alright with me,&rdquo; Tony said as he looked back over at Peter who\ncontinued to stare at Olivia. </p><p>Peter had kept his promise, he stayed until visiting hours\nwere over. Happy took Peter home, as well as, Pepper who refused at first but after\na small debate she finally caved in. The rest of the team had left a while\nback, mostly giving time for the family to be with Olivia, they would get their\nchance to see her when she woke up. They just wanted to make sure she was going\nto be okay.</p><p>Tony made himself comfortable on the hospital chair next to\nOlivia&rsquo;s bed, he stared at his daughter laying in that hospital bed. Thinking back\nto when she was born: </p><p><i>&ldquo;Alright, Mr. Stark,\nyou ready?&rdquo; The doctor announced as Andrea prepared herself for the last push.\n</i></p><p><i>Tony looked at Andrea in amazement, he kissed her temple, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re doing great,&rdquo; he whispered. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Fuck you,&rdquo; she\nsnarled. </i></p><p><i>He couldn&rsquo;t help but\nchuckle, he deserved that, &ldquo;yeah you did and look where it got us,&rdquo; he said\nwith a wink.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Now&rsquo;s not the time!&rdquo; Andrea yelled.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Count of three,&rdquo; the\ndoctor stated, &ldquo;one, two, three, push!&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>Andrea gave it her all,\nthe sound of a baby crying filled the room. Tony&rsquo;s heart leaped at the sound, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a girl!&rdquo; The doctor announced. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a girl!&rdquo; Tony\nrepeated as he kissed Andrea, &ldquo;we have a girl!&rdquo; Andrea cried tears of joy.</i></p><p><i>Tony quickly walked\nover and watched the nurses clean up his new baby girl, the nurse wrapped her\nin a blanket and gently handed her over to Tony. Tony gently held her as if his\nlife depended on it, &ldquo;oh my gosh,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;I love you so much,&rdquo; he\nstated. Tony looked up at Andrea who&rsquo;s eyes were locked with her daughter in\nthe arms of her father.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s beautiful,&rdquo; she\nwhispered.</i></p><p><i>Tony placed another\nkiss on Andrea&rsquo;s forehead, &ldquo;the greatest gift you could ever give me,&rdquo; he\nwhispered. </i></p><p>Tony leaned over to his daughter and kissed her forehead, &ldquo;my\ngreatest gift,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo; </p><p>~~</p><p>Olivia&rsquo;s eyes fluttered open, her breathing quickened, she wasn&rsquo;t\nsuccessful at her attempt. She let out a soft sob as she sat up on her bed. </p><p>Tony stirred in his sleep, opening his eyes to see his\ndaughter awake, crying, &ldquo;hey,&rdquo; he whispered as he quickly made his way over to\nher, &ldquo;shh,&rdquo; he said as he laid on the bed with her, gently putting her head on\nhis chest as he stroked her hair. </p><p>&ldquo;I just want to die!&rdquo; she exclaimed as she cried into her\nfathers chest. </p><p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; Tony whispered as tears welled up in his eyes from\nhearing his own flesh and blood, his own daughter, yell out that she wanted to\ndie. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that,&rdquo; he said softly as he placed a kiss on top of her\nhead. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; she sobbed. </p><p>Tony sighed and continued stroking her hair, in hopes it\nwould calm her down, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t lose you, Olivia,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;I lost your\nmother, my best friend. You&rsquo;re all I have left of her, of the time I spent with\nher. You mean the world to me, sweetheart and I don&rsquo;t know what I would do\nwithout you,&rdquo; Tony choked out, as tears made their way down his cheeks. </p><p>Olivia felt horrible for trying to take her life but felt\nlike her only escape, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she sobbed, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know what to do,&rdquo; She\nknew her father must have seen the note. </p><p>&ldquo;You should&rsquo;ve told me about what happened with Bren,&rdquo; he\ngave Olivia a gentle squeeze on the shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;I was scared,&rdquo; she whispered as her sobs began to decline. </p><p>Tony shook his head, &ldquo;scared of what? Me? My reaction?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Scared of what you might think of me, of what everyone might\nthink of me.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony grabbed his daughters face in a gentle way so that she\nwould look at him, &ldquo;Olivia Maria Stark, I would never think of you as anything\nother than a wonderful, strong, kind, beautiful&hellip; do you want me to keep going\nor are you going to stop me?&rdquo; </p><p>Olivia chuckled, &ldquo;I get it,&rdquo; she whispered. </p><p>&ldquo;What I&rsquo;m trying to say is that I will never think bad of\nyou for something you couldn&rsquo;t control,&rdquo; Tony gently stroked a strain of hair\nout of Olivia&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;I love you and I&rsquo;m so sorry I wasn&rsquo;t there to protect\nyou.&rdquo; </p><p>Olivia felt her eyes water up, she laid her head back onto\nher dad&rsquo;s chest, &ldquo;I wish you were,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;but you didn&rsquo;t know, neither\nof us did. We all thought nothing of it.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony and Olivia sat in silence, eventually, a nurse came in\nand said there were guests waiting in the lobby. Tony left and came back with\nPepper. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Olivia!&rdquo; Pepper exclaimed as tears welled up in her\neyes, she ran over to the young girl that she thought so much as a daughter. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Pepper,&rdquo; Olivia whispered as Pepper pulled the\nyoung girl into an embrace. </p><p>Pepper shook her head, &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m sorry, I should&rsquo;ve listened\nto you.&rdquo; Olivia wanted to argue but she knew it was no use. </p><p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s time for our family meeting,&rdquo; Tony said as he\ntook a seat by his daughter&rsquo;s bed. Pepper did the same on the opposite end.</p><p>&ldquo;I think we need to start the process of taking this to the court,&rdquo; Pepper informed.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, well, is it too late for a rape kit?&rdquo; Tony asked\nas he looked at Pepper and Liv. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, we&rsquo;ll just have to as-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I already did one,&rdquo; Olivia said, interrupting Pepper mid-sentence.\n</p><p>&ldquo;You already did a rape kit?&rdquo; Pepper asked as she gently held\nOlivia&rsquo;s hand. </p><p>She gave Pepper a nod, &ldquo;I wanted to make sure I was raped,&rdquo;\nOlivia whispered, &ldquo;the nurse said she&rsquo;ll hold on to it just in case I ever want\nto use it as evidence.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;So, then what are we waiting for? Let&rsquo;s take this bastard\nto court!&rdquo; Tony exclaimed as he walked over to his daughter&rsquo;s hospital bed. </p><p>Olivia shook her head, &ldquo;no,&rdquo; she said softly.</p><p>&ldquo;No? Olivia, sweetie, baby, he hurt you. He raped you! He\ncaused you so many years of trauma and what does he get? To live life perfectly\nfine! We have to do something!&rdquo; Tony explained as he grabbed his daughter&rsquo;s\nother hand, gently giving it a squeeze, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand around watching that kid\nlive life knowing damn well he has done horrible things.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony had a point, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; she whispered.</p><p>&ldquo;So, which nurse was this?&rdquo; Pepper asked</p><p>&ldquo;Her name is Daniela.&rdquo; </p><p><b><br /></b></p><p><b><br /></b></p><p><b><br /></b></p><h2><b>Taglist will close on May 5th!&nbsp;</b></h2><p><b>Taglist:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQCoyB30ZsdXW44DY5vb1mA\" target=\"_blank\">@waves-and-sunflowers</a> \n@<strike>hgacutan</strike> @<strike>opalof</strike> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/moO5ASXsR-8zVvnRKaO4y9w\" target=\"_blank\">@spiderlingsweb</a> \n@a<strike>ppreciating-chase-brod</strike>y <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSc5fplRrbRGo_53GaNFfHw\" target=\"_blank\">@rebellbelle</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMUcNZwqcER8WcUxUkbj1dg\" target=\"_blank\">@emmii4</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myvCOFl7bokocOR314ZYTRA\" target=\"_blank\">@thatweirdblonde</a>&nbsp;

He waited for a second before putting his arms around me as well, pulling me inside the appartement. \u201cIs Steve home?\u201d I asked, still holding him close to me \u201cNo\u201d I pulled back from the hug and looked at him \u201cgood\u201d he pushed my hair out of my face and kept his hands on my cheeks \u201cWanna talk about it?\u201d I stared at him for a second before letting out a deep breath \u201cTell me you wont break my heart\u201d he looked taken back and shook his head \u201cY/N\u2026 I could never\u201d I simply nodded and let my head fall on his chest again. \u201cI love you\u201d he said, kissing my head and I smiled \u201cI love you too\u201d </p><p><br></p><p><i>It\u2019s funny 'cause at times it feels like us against the world</i></p><p><i>They treat you like a criminal but I\u2019ll still be your girl</i></p><p><i>I\u2019d ride or die with you</i></p><p><i>Walk the line if you asked me to</i></p><p><br></p><p>The sun was shining on both of our faces as we enjoyed our cup of coffee in the cafe right outside of Bucky\u2019s building. Today was the hottest day of the year so far and God I was melting. I looked over at Bucky who wore a white t-shirt, his metal arm exposed. \u201cWanna order lunch now?\u201d I asked and he nodded. I looked for a menu and saw one on the table next to us \u201cExcuse me, can I have the menu please\u201d I kindly asked the woman next to me, she turned her head to look at me and her glance fell on Bucky\u2019s arm. I could see the sudden fear in her eyes as she shakingly handed me the menu. I opened it and started scanning the menu \u201cOh babe they have steak t-\u201c I suddenly heard a chair move and looked up to see Bucky leave \u201cBabe?\u201d I questioned and quickly stood up, following him \u201cBucky!\u201d I yelled after him but he just kept walking. As I caught up to him I grabbed his arm and turned him around \u201cHey, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d \u201c3 years. It took the world 3 years to accept me.. or so I thought they did\u201d I looked at him in confusion before it clicked. The woman in the cafe. He must have noticed how she looked at his metal arm \u201cYou know maybe Tony\u2019s right. I\u2019m not good enough for you\u201d he said and I shook my head, placing my hands on his chest \u201cBaby, look at me. I\u2019m your girl. I\u2019ll always be your girl. I dont give a damn about what people think of us. I love you, nothing can change that\u201d he looked at me and smiled, a little taken back by my sudden speech \u201cYour my girl\u201d he smiled and I nodded \u201cI\u2019m your girl\u201d </p><p><br></p><p><i>You don\u2019t know about our love</i></p><p><i>You choose what you see</i></p><p><i>'Cause if you felt the way we love</i></p><p><i>You\u2019d just let it be</i></p><p><br></p><p>It was one of my dad\u2019s fancy parties and everyone was there. And by everyone I mean\u2026 everyone. It seemed as if this time he had invited the whole city of New York to the party and to be honest, I wasn\u2019t totally comfortable with this many people in my home. I looked down to all the people in my living room and couldn\u2019t help but smile as I spotted Bucky and Steve laughing at something that Sam had said. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really not gonna follow my advice are you\u201d I turned around to see my dad \u201cWhen do you ever follow mine?\u201d I shot back and he chuckled \u201cTouch\u00e9\u201d he handed me a glass of expensive champagne and I gladly accepted it, taking a sip \u201cDid you atleast think about what I said?\u201d \u201cDad, have you ever taken a minute of your day to even talk to him? I dont believe you have ever said more than 2 words to him. You don\u2019t know him. You dont know what he\u2019s like, how he treats me, how he loves me. You dont know our love, because you\u2019re not giving it a chance.\u201d My dad looked at to where Bucky was standing and sighed \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll try. But if he hurts you I swear I-\u201c I cut him off as I hugged him \u201cThank you dad\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><i>You don\u2019t know about the times</i></p><p><i>When it\u2019s just him and me</i></p><p><i>'Cause if you felt the way we love</i></p><p><i>You\u2019d just let it be</i></p><p><br></p><p>Walking across the busy room I focused on Bucky and made my way towards him. He saw me coming and a big smile appeared on his face \u201cHey my love\u201d he put his free hand around my shoulder and kissed my cheek before taking a sip from his beer. \u201cYou doing okay?\u201d I asked him and he nodded \u201cLittle too busy for me but I\u2019m good now that you\u2019re here\u201d I smiled at his comment and gently rubbed his cheek  \u201cMy dad said he\u2019d try\u201d the statement obviously surprised him as he choked on his drink \u201cwhat?\u201d He asked and I laughed, wiping away the spilled beer from his lips \u201cI talked to him, he\u2019s gonna try to atleast say \u2018hi\u2019 to you\u201d he put down his beer and grabbed my shoulders \u201cDo you think he\u2019ll finally bless me to ask you to marry me\u201d I laughed and grabbed his cheeks \u201cLet\u2019s first survive our first dinner as a family\u201d \u201cFamily\u2026 that had a nice ring to it\u201d I gently kissed his lips and smiled \u201cWell get used to it, because that\u2019s what we are\u201d.</p><p>Tony was watching from a far as his daughter gently kissed the man of her dreams. His heart ached at the sight. His daughter didn\u2019t need him anymore like she used to. She didn\u2019t need him to protect her anymore. No, that was all Bucky\u2019s job now. He knew a father\u2019s love could never die, but somehow he felt as if she wasn\u2019t daddy\u2019s little girl anymore. Tony stared at Bucky who gave his daughter the most loving look a man could give and that\u2019s when he knew. Thats when he knew he would try, because damn\u2026 Bucky loved Y/N with all his heart. </p></p>",
