You never thought that being an\navenger was so hard, but you are glad to help all those people. But you are\nreally tired and the only thing you want to do is to curl up with your\ngirlfriend that you seriously miss and take all the rest you can get.<br/><br/>\nAfter leaving all of your\nstuff in the avenger\u2019s compound you go straight to the apartment that you share\nwith Carol since 6 months ago. You go to your room and find Carol lying on her\nside, her back towards you. You smile and go directly towards her, not wanting\nto wake her up in case she is already asleep.<br/><br/>\nAs you are about to give her\na kiss on her temple, you see her brown eyes open staring straight ahead.\n\u201cHello beautiful, I thought you were sleeping\u201d<br/><br/>\nCarol didn\u2019t answer you; she\njust hummed to acknowledge your presence.<br/><br/><br/></p><!-- more --><p>You ignored that, probably she was on the verge of falling asleep; after\nall, she is probably the most powerful avenger and has lots of missions daily\ntoo. You miss her a lot, and you haven\u2019t talked properly in all this time. You\nremove your clothes as your start talking with Carol, knowing that she\u2019s\nlistening to you.<br/><br/>\n\u201cThe mission was very\ndelicate, there were lots of hidden bombs inside the building and Sam\naccidentally activated one, pftttt such a mess, but luckily no one got hurt&hellip;\nI\u2019m so glad that we ended the mission well. I feel so tired; at least now I can\nhave a well-deserved rest. And how was your day, baby?\u201d You ask Carol while\nremoving the rest of your clothes.<br/><br/>\n\u201cGood, I guess&hellip; not as\nexciting as yours. But can\u2019t complain\u201d Carol answers so soft that sounds\nforced.</p><p>\u201cMmm I see\u201d You hummed and when you are left only in your\nunderwear you turn to Carol, who hasn\u2019t moved since you arrived. \u201cBaby, I\u2019m\ngoing to take a shower&hellip; wanna join me?\u201d<br/><br/>\nCarol answers with the soft\nvoice again \u201cNo, I\u2019m good.\u201d<br/><br/>\nYou raise your eyebrows,\nsensing that something is wrong. Carol never rejected your invitations to\nshower together. But you were too tired to think much about it. So you just say\na soft \u201cok\u201d before proceeding with your shower.<br/><br/>\n20 minutes later you came\nout of the shower wrapped in a towel around you, droplets of water dripping\nfrom your hair. Carol was now curled up facing you; she looks at you briefly\nbefore putting her gaze away again.<br/><br/>\n\u201cCarol, is there something\nwrong?\u201d You ask while drying your hair with another towel, standing in front of\nher. But instead of answering Carol turns her back again without saying\nanything. \u201cWhat? Are we ignoring each other now?\u201d You are definitely amused by\nher actions. \u201cDid we have a fight that I don\u2019t remember? Was I asleep when we\nwere fighting?\u201d You ask with your lips curling in a smug grin.<br/><br/>\nBut Carol doesn\u2019t answer,\nshe only huffs loudly. So you crawl on the bed towards her, resting your arm on\nhers but she pushes you away. You honestly find Carol cute with this attitude,\nbut you know when no to push her buttons, a mad Carol is definitely scary. So\nremoving all the smugness in your tone you ask again. \u201cBaby, what\u2019s wrong? It\nwas something I did.\u201d<br/><br/>\nYou are totally surprised of\nwhy Carol is acting this way&hellip; you are not always an asshole. But whatever it\nwas this time, has made Carol being mad at you.<br/>\nBut no matter how much you\nthought about it, you can\u2019t think of anything you did to cause her to be this\nway.<br/><br/>\n\u201cBaby come on, please, tell\nme. Did I do something?\u201d You move away from her to put some sleeping clothes\nand returning to bed, you lean on her again and this time she didn\u2019t brush you\naway and she lets you wrap your arm lightly around her.<br/><br/>\n\u201cNo. (Y/N). You didn\u2019t do\nanything.\u201d Carol spoke, annoyed and clearly pissed.<br/><br/>\n\u201cThen what\u2019s wrong? Is it\nsomething I didn\u2019t do?\u201d Carol remains silent and you take that as a\nconfirmation. \u201cOk, I see. It\u2019s something I didn\u2019t do. What did I not do? Omg is\nit our anniversary today? Mmm no that\u2019s not for another two months&hellip;\u201d<br/><br/>\nYou were brainstorming,\nhumming out loud, thinking of what it was that you didn\u2019t do to get Carol so\npissed.<br/><br/>\n\u201c(Y/N), shut up\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cWhat? I\u2019m just trying to\nthink of what it was that I didn\u2019t do that\u2019s causing you to act this way.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cForget about it. Let\u2019s just\ngo to sleep.\u201d Carol has the blanket all over her, and shifts her body so she\ncould turn her back on you again.<br/><br/>\n\u201cNo, we are no sleeping\nuntil we fix this. Did I forget to kiss you goodbye when I left this morning?\nBaby, you have to tell me what I didn\u2019t do?\u201d And then a light bulb lit at the\ntop of your head, suddenly realizing what was wrong. \u201cOh!\u201d You exclaim a little\nproud of yourself getting to the root of all of this. \u201cYou!\u201d You say amused.<br/><br/>\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Carol looks at you,\nstill looking pissed and now confused too.<br/><br/>\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do you!\u201d You\nchuckle and Carol takes the blanket off of her, sits up and glares at you. You\ncan see her fist starting to glow as well as her eyes. Thanks God she loves\nyou, if not you would have been dead by now, right?<br/><br/>\n\u201cSo you find this funny?! I\ncan\u2019t fucking believe you!!\u201d Carol says blasting the wall behind you, throwing\nher legs off the bed about to leave but you grippe her arm; you can control\nfire, so you can handle a little her power. You pull her to sit again while you\nlook briefly at the hole in the wall <i>\u2018Great\nthe landlord is going to kill me if Carol doesn\u2019t\u2019</i></p><p>You know that you should stop smiling like an idiot; Carol was really\npissed, but you couldn\u2019t rid yourself of the traitorous chuckle that escaped\nfrom your lips.

You miss her a lot, and you haven\u2019t talked properly in all this time. You\nremove your clothes as your start talking with Carol, knowing that she\u2019s\nlistening to you.<br><br>\n\u201cThe mission was very\ndelicate, there were lots of hidden bombs inside the building and Sam\naccidentally activated one, pftttt such a mess, but luckily no one got hurt\u2026\nI\u2019m so glad that we ended the mission well. I feel so tired; at least now I can\nhave a well-deserved rest. And how was your day, baby?\u201d You ask Carol while\nremoving the rest of your clothes.<br><br>\n\u201cGood, I guess\u2026 not as\nexciting as yours. But can\u2019t complain\u201d Carol answers so soft that sounds\nforced.</p><p>\u201cMmm I see\u201d You hummed and when you are left only in your\nunderwear you turn to Carol, who hasn\u2019t moved since you arrived. \u201cBaby, I\u2019m\ngoing to take a shower\u2026 wanna join me?\u201d<br><br>\nCarol answers with the soft\nvoice again \u201cNo, I\u2019m good.\u201d<br><br>\nYou raise your eyebrows,\nsensing that something is wrong. Carol never rejected your invitations to\nshower together. But you were too tired to think much about it. So you just say\na soft \u201cok\u201d before proceeding with your shower.<br><br>\n20 minutes later you came\nout of the shower wrapped in a towel around you, droplets of water dripping\nfrom your hair. Carol was now curled up facing you; she looks at you briefly\nbefore putting her gaze away again.<br><br>\n\u201cCarol, is there something\nwrong?\u201d You ask while drying your hair with another towel, standing in front of\nher. But instead of answering Carol turns her back again without saying\nanything. \u201cWhat? Are we ignoring each other now?\u201d You are definitely amused by\nher actions. \u201cDid we have a fight that I don\u2019t remember? Was I asleep when we\nwere fighting?\u201d You ask with your lips curling in a smug grin.<br><br>\nBut Carol doesn\u2019t answer,\nshe only huffs loudly. So you crawl on the bed towards her, resting your arm on\nhers but she pushes you away. You honestly find Carol cute with this attitude,\nbut you know when no to push her buttons, a mad Carol is definitely scary. So\nremoving all the smugness in your tone you ask again. \u201cBaby, what\u2019s wrong? It\nwas something I did.\u201d<br><br>\nYou are totally surprised of\nwhy Carol is acting this way\u2026 you are not always an asshole. But whatever it\nwas this time, has made Carol being mad at you.<br>\nBut no matter how much you\nthought about it, you can\u2019t think of anything you did to cause her to be this\nway.<br><br>\n\u201cBaby come on, please, tell\nme. Did I do something?\u201d You move away from her to put some sleeping clothes\nand returning to bed, you lean on her again and this time she didn\u2019t brush you\naway and she lets you wrap your arm lightly around her.<br><br>\n\u201cNo. (Y/N). You didn\u2019t do\nanything.\u201d Carol spoke, annoyed and clearly pissed.<br><br>\n\u201cThen what\u2019s wrong? Is it\nsomething I didn\u2019t do?\u201d Carol remains silent and you take that as a\nconfirmation. \u201cOk, I see. It\u2019s something I didn\u2019t do. What did I not do? Omg is\nit our anniversary today? Mmm no that\u2019s not for another two months\u2026\u201d<br><br>\nYou were brainstorming,\nhumming out loud, thinking of what it was that you didn\u2019t do to get Carol so\npissed.<br><br>\n\u201c(Y/N), shut up\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cWhat? I\u2019m just trying to\nthink of what it was that I didn\u2019t do that\u2019s causing you to act this way.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cForget about it. Let\u2019s just\ngo to sleep.\u201d Carol has the blanket all over her, and shifts her body so she\ncould turn her back on you again.<br><br>\n\u201cNo, we are no sleeping\nuntil we fix this. Did I forget to kiss you goodbye when I left this morning?\nBaby, you have to tell me what I didn\u2019t do?\u201d And then a light bulb lit at the\ntop of your head, suddenly realizing what was wrong. \u201cOh!\u201d You exclaim a little\nproud of yourself getting to the root of all of this. \u201cYou!\u201d You say amused.<br><br>\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Carol looks at you,\nstill looking pissed and now confused too.<br><br>\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do you!\u201d You\nchuckle and Carol takes the blanket off of her, sits up and glares at you. You\ncan see her fist starting to glow as well as her eyes. Thanks God she loves\nyou, if not you would have been dead by now, right?<br><br>\n\u201cSo you find this funny?! I\ncan\u2019t fucking believe you!!\u201d Carol says blasting the wall behind you, throwing\nher legs off the bed about to leave but you grippe her arm; you can control\nfire, so you can handle a little her power. You pull her to sit again while you\nlook briefly at the hole in the wall <i>\u2018Great\nthe landlord is going to kill me if Carol doesn\u2019t\u2019</i></p><p>You know that you should stop smiling like an idiot; Carol was really\npissed, but you couldn\u2019t rid yourself of the traitorous chuckle that escaped\nfrom your lips.

You never thought that being an\navenger was so hard, but you are glad to help all those people. But you are\nreally tired and the only thing you want to do is to curl up with your\ngirlfriend that you seriously miss and take all the rest you can get.<br><br>\nAfter leaving all of your\nstuff in the avenger\u2019s compound you go straight to the apartment that you share\nwith Carol since 6 months ago. You go to your room and find Carol lying on her\nside, her back towards you. You smile and go directly towards her, not wanting\nto wake her up in case she is already asleep.<br><br>\nAs you are about to give her\na kiss on her temple, you see her brown eyes open staring straight ahead.\n\u201cHello beautiful, I thought you were sleeping\u201d<br><br>\nCarol didn\u2019t answer you; she\njust hummed to acknowledge your presence.<br><br><br></p>[[MORE]]<p>You ignored that, probably she was on the verge of falling asleep; after\nall, she is probably the most powerful avenger and has lots of missions daily\ntoo. You miss her a lot, and you haven\u2019t talked properly in all this time. You\nremove your clothes as your start talking with Carol, knowing that she\u2019s\nlistening to you.<br><br>\n\u201cThe mission was very\ndelicate, there were lots of hidden bombs inside the building and Sam\naccidentally activated one, pftttt such a mess, but luckily no one got hurt\u2026\nI\u2019m so glad that we ended the mission well. I feel so tired; at least now I can\nhave a well-deserved rest. And how was your day, baby?\u201d You ask Carol while\nremoving the rest of your clothes.<br><br>\n\u201cGood, I guess\u2026 not as\nexciting as yours. But can\u2019t complain\u201d Carol answers so soft that sounds\nforced.</p><p>\u201cMmm I see\u201d You hummed and when you are left only in your\nunderwear you turn to Carol, who hasn\u2019t moved since you arrived. \u201cBaby, I\u2019m\ngoing to take a shower\u2026 wanna join me?\u201d<br><br>\nCarol answers with the soft\nvoice again \u201cNo, I\u2019m good.\u201d<br><br>\nYou raise your eyebrows,\nsensing that something is wrong. Carol never rejected your invitations to\nshower together. But you were too tired to think much about it. So you just say\na soft \u201cok\u201d before proceeding with your shower.<br><br>\n20 minutes later you came\nout of the shower wrapped in a towel around you, droplets of water dripping\nfrom your hair. Carol was now curled up facing you; she looks at you briefly\nbefore putting her gaze away again.<br><br>\n\u201cCarol, is there something\nwrong?\u201d You ask while drying your hair with another towel, standing in front of\nher. But instead of answering Carol turns her back again without saying\nanything. \u201cWhat? Are we ignoring each other now?\u201d You are definitely amused by\nher actions. \u201cDid we have a fight that I don\u2019t remember? Was I asleep when we\nwere fighting?\u201d You ask with your lips curling in a smug grin.<br><br>\nBut Carol doesn\u2019t answer,\nshe only huffs loudly. So you crawl on the bed towards her, resting your arm on\nhers but she pushes you away. You honestly find Carol cute with this attitude,\nbut you know when no to push her buttons, a mad Carol is definitely scary. So\nremoving all the smugness in your tone you ask again. \u201cBaby, what\u2019s wrong? It\nwas something I did.\u201d<br><br>\nYou are totally surprised of\nwhy Carol is acting this way\u2026 you are not always an asshole. But whatever it\nwas this time, has made Carol being mad at you.<br>\nBut no matter how much you\nthought about it, you can\u2019t think of anything you did to cause her to be this\nway.<br><br>\n\u201cBaby come on, please, tell\nme. Did I do something?\u201d You move away from her to put some sleeping clothes\nand returning to bed, you lean on her again and this time she didn\u2019t brush you\naway and she lets you wrap your arm lightly around her.<br><br>\n\u201cNo. (Y/N). You didn\u2019t do\nanything.\u201d Carol spoke, annoyed and clearly pissed.<br><br>\n\u201cThen what\u2019s wrong? Is it\nsomething I didn\u2019t do?\u201d Carol remains silent and you take that as a\nconfirmation. \u201cOk, I see. It\u2019s something I didn\u2019t do. What did I not do? Omg is\nit our anniversary today? Mmm no that\u2019s not for another two months\u2026\u201d<br><br>\nYou were brainstorming,\nhumming out loud, thinking of what it was that you didn\u2019t do to get Carol so\npissed.<br><br>\n\u201c(Y/N), shut up\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cWhat? I\u2019m just trying to\nthink of what it was that I didn\u2019t do that\u2019s causing you to act this way.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cForget about it. Let\u2019s just\ngo to sleep.\u201d Carol has the blanket all over her, and shifts her body so she\ncould turn her back on you again.<br><br>\n\u201cNo, we are no sleeping\nuntil we fix this. Did I forget to kiss you goodbye when I left this morning?\nBaby, you have to tell me what I didn\u2019t do?\u201d And then a light bulb lit at the\ntop of your head, suddenly realizing what was wrong. \u201cOh!\u201d You exclaim a little\nproud of yourself getting to the root of all of this. \u201cYou!\u201d You say amused.<br><br>\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Carol looks at you,\nstill looking pissed and now confused too.<br><br>\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do you!\u201d You\nchuckle and Carol takes the blanket off of her, sits up and glares at you. You\ncan see her fist starting to glow as well as her eyes. Thanks God she loves\nyou, if not you would have been dead by now, right?<br><br>\n\u201cSo you find this funny?! I\ncan\u2019t fucking believe you!!\u201d Carol says blasting the wall behind you, throwing\nher legs off the bed about to leave but you grippe her arm; you can control\nfire, so you can handle a little her power. You pull her to sit again while you\nlook briefly at the hole in the wall <i>\u2018Great\nthe landlord is going to kill me if Carol doesn\u2019t\u2019</i></p><p>You know that you should stop smiling like an idiot; Carol was really\npissed, but you couldn\u2019t rid yourself of the traitorous chuckle that escaped\nfrom your lips. Of course Carol would be acting this way. You haven\u2019t had sex\nin almost a month and it\u2019s the longest you have gone without it. </p><p>\u201cBaby, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m gonna stop laughing now, please calm down and\ndon\u2019t leave\u201d You do your best to stifle your laugh that is still threatening to\nbe the cause of your death, biting you bottom lip to keep you from even\nsmiling.</p><p>Carol starts to calm down a little, at least she\u2019s not glowing anymore\nand she lets you hold her as she is sitting on her side of the bed and you\nshuffle your body closer to her. You wrap your arms around her, resting your\nchin on Carol\u2019s shoulder. At the contact, Carol sighs, resting her weight\nagainst you.</p><p>You know that Carol is acting childish, it\u2019s either your fault that you\nboth are gone on missions for too long. She has told you how proud she is for\nyou, but even the strongest avenger needs to cuddle and some love, you guess\nthat her hormones got the best of her.</p><p>Carol cracks her neck to the side to look at you, \u201c(Y/N), we haven\u2019t\nspoken properly in God knows how long. I haven\u2019t seen you. I go to sleep\nwithout you and when I woke up you are gone, and this is how you react?\nLaughing? You kno\u2026\u201d</p><p>You interrupt her smashing your lips on her roughly kissing her, your\ntongue immediately darting insider her mouth to explore its insides\ndeliciously. Carol moans, making you know that she feels good. As soon as you\npull away to look at her eyes you smile and Carol smiles too, you know that you\nare forgiven.</p><p>She shook her head, not being able to smirk \u201cYou are lucky you are damn\ngood at this.\u201d</p><p>You push her on the bed and you straddle her, locking her in place.\nCarol looks straight at your eyes and you can feel the heat emanating from her\nbody. She grabs your neck and pulls you down, crashing her lips on yours. You\nkiss her deeply, exploring each other\u2019s mouths, your hands feeling up her body,\nyou can hear her whimpering trough the kiss. </p><p>\u201cOff\u201d Carol suddenly says, breathing deeply and tugging at your clothes.\n\u201cI need you to take this fucking thing off\u201d You feel obliged, taking your\nclothes and watching Carol doing the same with hers too.</p><p>Both of you naked, you press your body against Carol again and the\nreaction of both is instant as you feel your skin against her. You can feel\nCarol\u2019s arousal between her legs as you press your right thigh, brushing\nCarol\u2019s center with it. And you can help but moan at how wet Carol is for you.</p><p>You connect your lips again and you hand goes straight to Carol\u2019s left\nbreast, kneading it against your palm. Carol moans against your lips, arching\nher body upwards to feel you, you pinch her nipple with your thumb and\nforefinger, rolling them around it, feeling it harden.</p><p>Your leave her lips and kiss her neck, feeling Carol\u2019s body arching with\nher head thrown out, giving you better access to her neck. You bit, suck and\nlick causing exquisite sounds to come out of Carol\u2019s mouth.</p><p><a></a>You make a trail of kisses downward from her throat\nto the middle of her chest, your left hand still playing with her left nipple\nand your right hand entwined with Carol\u2019s finger above your head.</p><p><a></a>Slowly, your lips find her\nother nipple and soon enough you are making circles against it with your\ntongue. Carol is writhing so much that you think she\u2019s about to come only at\nthe feel of your tongue on her nipple.</p><p><a></a>\u201c(Y/N)\u201d Carol\u2019s tone came\nout as a plea, and you know how much she is in need, so you move downwards,\nleaving a trail of kisses toward her abdomen, to the insides of her thighs.</p><p><a></a>You can smell her arousal\nand you feel more turn on at the scent. You grip her thighs, spread them wider\nand you see her center glistening and so wet, you moan and kiss the insides of\nthe thighs and you look at Carol, she\u2019s looking back at you with hooded eyes,\nher hair is disheveled and her mouth slightly open with her chest rising and\nfalling rapidly.</p><p><a></a>She is so beautiful and you\ncan\u2019t help but fall in love with her more.</p><p><a></a>You both smile at the same time\nand not wanting to wait any longer you press your mouth against Carol\u2019s clit\nand her hips involuntarily lift.</p><p><a></a>You swipe your tongue\nagainst her opening towards her clit in one swift motion. Carol\u2019s hand grasps\nyour hair.</p><p><a></a>\u201c(Y/N)\u201d She whispers again,\nwanting to feel more.</p><p><a></a>You comply and you focus on\nher clit, circling it repeatedly, enjoying Carol\u2019s arousal on your chin. You\nsuck on it and Carol\u2019s hips buckle, her hands pulling your hair harshly,\nmumbling \u201cFuck\u201d \u201cOh my God\u201d \u201c(Y/N)\u201d.</p><p><a></a>You repeat that motion until\nyou are sure Carol is close to the edge, but not yet close enough to reach the\npeak of her pleasure. </p><p><a></a>\u201cMmmm (Y/N)\u2026 baby\u201d Carol\nsounds desperate and you know that she needs her release so bad. \u201cPlease\u2026\u201d She\nis breathing heavily and she\u2019s locking you with her legs on your neck,\ndesperate for the contact that you are not giving her. \u201cI need you inside\u2026\nright now\u2026 or I swear to\u2026 OH MY GOD!\u201d Carol screams as you finally slid two\nfingers inside her, so easily because of how wet Carol is.</p><p><a></a>You moan against her center,\nand you feel Carol shaking at the vibrations that sends towards her body. \u201cMmm\ndon\u2019t stop baby\u2026\u201d Carol mutters, as your actions catch pace. \u201cPlease don\u2019t\nstop\u201d Carol was so close to breaking apart.</p><p><a></a>The simultaneous movement\nof your tongue and fingers against her was bringing Carol so close to the point\nof no return and you decide to add another finger at the same time you suck\nCarol\u2019s clit and you feel her shaking and having convulsions, muttering\nnonsense while her eyes are close tightly.</p><p><a></a>You keep moving inside of\nher again, you feel her walls clenching against your fingers again and you see\nher abdomen clenching tightly in anticipation of another earth-shattering\nrelease. </p><p><a></a>\u201cMmmm fuck, fuck, fuck\u2026\n(Y/N)!!!\u201d Carol is biting her hand, trying to prevent that the neighbors hear\nanything.

                "content": "<p>Carol Danvers/Female Reader</p><p>Reader is part of the avengers too, but has been very busy lately.</p><p>Warnings: subCarol, topReader, explicit language and smut.</p><p>This is not mine, a friend of mine wrote but wants to share it.&nbsp;</p><p>Words: 2,744</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt&rsquo;s almost 11 pm and it&rsquo;s the earliest you have\nbeen back for a mission in more than a month. You never thought that being an\navenger was so hard, but you are glad to help all those people. But you are\nreally tired and the only thing you want to do is to curl up with your\ngirlfriend that you seriously miss and take all the rest you can get.<br /><br />\nAfter leaving all of your\nstuff in the avenger&rsquo;s compound you go straight to the apartment that you share\nwith Carol since 6 months ago. You go to your room and find Carol lying on her\nside, her back towards you. You smile and go directly towards her, not wanting\nto wake her up in case she is already asleep.<br /><br />\nAs you are about to give her\na kiss on her temple, you see her brown eyes open staring straight ahead.\n&ldquo;Hello beautiful, I thought you were sleeping&rdquo;<br /><br />\nCarol didn&rsquo;t answer you; she\njust hummed to acknowledge your presence.<br /><br /><br /></p><p>You ignored that, probably she was on the verge of falling asleep; after\nall, she is probably the most powerful avenger and has lots of missions daily\ntoo. You miss her a lot, and you haven&rsquo;t talked properly in all this time. You\nremove your clothes as your start talking with Carol, knowing that she&rsquo;s\nlistening to you.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;The mission was very\ndelicate, there were lots of hidden bombs inside the building and Sam\naccidentally activated one, pftttt such a mess, but luckily no one got hurt&hellip;\nI&rsquo;m so glad that we ended the mission well. I feel so tired; at least now I can\nhave a well-deserved rest. And how was your day, baby?&rdquo; You ask Carol while\nremoving the rest of your clothes.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Good, I guess&hellip; not as\nexciting as yours. But can&rsquo;t complain&rdquo; Carol answers so soft that sounds\nforced.</p><p>&ldquo;Mmm I see&rdquo; You hummed and when you are left only in your\nunderwear you turn to Carol, who hasn&rsquo;t moved since you arrived. &ldquo;Baby, I&rsquo;m\ngoing to take a shower&hellip; wanna join me?&rdquo;<br /><br />\nCarol answers with the soft\nvoice again &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m good.&rdquo;<br /><br />\nYou raise your eyebrows,\nsensing that something is wrong. Carol never rejected your invitations to\nshower together. But you were too tired to think much about it. So you just say\na soft &ldquo;ok&rdquo; before proceeding with your shower.<br /><br />\n20 minutes later you came\nout of the shower wrapped in a towel around you, droplets of water dripping\nfrom your hair. Carol was now curled up facing you; she looks at you briefly\nbefore putting her gaze away again.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Carol, is there something\nwrong?&rdquo; You ask while drying your hair with another towel, standing in front of\nher. But instead of answering Carol turns her back again without saying\nanything. &ldquo;What? Are we ignoring each other now?&rdquo; You are definitely amused by\nher actions. &ldquo;Did we have a fight that I don&rsquo;t remember? Was I asleep when we\nwere fighting?&rdquo; You ask with your lips curling in a smug grin.<br /><br />\nBut Carol doesn&rsquo;t answer,\nshe only huffs loudly. So you crawl on the bed towards her, resting your arm on\nhers but she pushes you away. You honestly find Carol cute with this attitude,\nbut you know when no to push her buttons, a mad Carol is definitely scary. So\nremoving all the smugness in your tone you ask again. &ldquo;Baby, what&rsquo;s wrong? It\nwas something I did.&rdquo;<br /><br />\nYou are totally surprised of\nwhy Carol is acting this way&hellip; you are not always an asshole. But whatever it\nwas this time, has made Carol being mad at you.<br />\nBut no matter how much you\nthought about it, you can&rsquo;t think of anything you did to cause her to be this\nway.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Baby come on, please, tell\nme. Did I do something?&rdquo; You move away from her to put some sleeping clothes\nand returning to bed, you lean on her again and this time she didn&rsquo;t brush you\naway and she lets you wrap your arm lightly around her.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;No. (Y/N). You didn&rsquo;t do\nanything.&rdquo; Carol spoke, annoyed and clearly pissed.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Then what&rsquo;s wrong? Is it\nsomething I didn&rsquo;t do?&rdquo; Carol remains silent and you take that as a\nconfirmation. &ldquo;Ok, I see. It&rsquo;s something I didn&rsquo;t do. What did I not do? Omg is\nit our anniversary today? Mmm no that&rsquo;s not for another two months&hellip;&rdquo;<br /><br />\nYou were brainstorming,\nhumming out loud, thinking of what it was that you didn&rsquo;t do to get Carol so\npissed.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;(Y/N), shut up&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;What? I&rsquo;m just trying to\nthink of what it was that I didn&rsquo;t do that&rsquo;s causing you to act this way.&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Forget about it. Let&rsquo;s just\ngo to sleep.&rdquo; Carol has the blanket all over her, and shifts her body so she\ncould turn her back on you again.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;No, we are no sleeping\nuntil we fix this. Did I forget to kiss you goodbye when I left this morning?\nBaby, you have to tell me what I didn&rsquo;t do?&rdquo; And then a light bulb lit at the\ntop of your head, suddenly realizing what was wrong. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; You exclaim a little\nproud of yourself getting to the root of all of this. &ldquo;You!&rdquo; You say amused.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Carol looks at you,\nstill looking pissed and now confused too.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do you!&rdquo; You\nchuckle and Carol takes the blanket off of her, sits up and glares at you. You\ncan see her fist starting to glow as well as her eyes. Thanks God she loves\nyou, if not you would have been dead by now, right?<br /><br />\n&ldquo;So you find this funny?! I\ncan&rsquo;t fucking believe you!!&rdquo; Carol says blasting the wall behind you, throwing\nher legs off the bed about to leave but you grippe her arm; you can control\nfire, so you can handle a little her power. You pull her to sit again while you\nlook briefly at the hole in the wall <i>&lsquo;Great\nthe landlord is going to kill me if Carol doesn&rsquo;t&rsquo;</i></p><p>You know that you should stop smiling like an idiot; Carol was really\npissed, but you couldn&rsquo;t rid yourself of the traitorous chuckle that escaped\nfrom your lips. Of course Carol would be acting this way. You haven&rsquo;t had sex\nin almost a month and it&rsquo;s the longest you have gone without it. </p><p>&ldquo;Baby, I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m gonna stop laughing now, please calm down and\ndon&rsquo;t leave&rdquo; You do your best to stifle your laugh that is still threatening to\nbe the cause of your death, biting you bottom lip to keep you from even\nsmiling.</p><p>Carol starts to calm down a little, at least she&rsquo;s not glowing anymore\nand she lets you hold her as she is sitting on her side of the bed and you\nshuffle your body closer to her. You wrap your arms around her, resting your\nchin on Carol&rsquo;s shoulder. At the contact, Carol sighs, resting her weight\nagainst you.</p><p>You know that Carol is acting childish, it&rsquo;s either your fault that you\nboth are gone on missions for too long. She has told you how proud she is for\nyou, but even the strongest avenger needs to cuddle and some love, you guess\nthat her hormones got the best of her.</p><p>Carol cracks her neck to the side to look at you, &ldquo;(Y/N), we haven&rsquo;t\nspoken properly in God knows how long. I haven&rsquo;t seen you. I go to sleep\nwithout you and when I woke up you are gone, and this is how you react?\nLaughing? You kno&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>You interrupt her smashing your lips on her roughly kissing her, your\ntongue immediately darting insider her mouth to explore its insides\ndeliciously. Carol moans, making you know that she feels good. As soon as you\npull away to look at her eyes you smile and Carol smiles too, you know that you\nare forgiven.</p><p>She shook her head, not being able to smirk &ldquo;You are lucky you are damn\ngood at this.&rdquo;</p><p>You push her on the bed and you straddle her, locking her in place.\nCarol looks straight at your eyes and you can feel the heat emanating from her\nbody. She grabs your neck and pulls you down, crashing her lips on yours. You\nkiss her deeply, exploring each other&rsquo;s mouths, your hands feeling up her body,\nyou can hear her whimpering trough the kiss. </p><p>&ldquo;Off&rdquo; Carol suddenly says, breathing deeply and tugging at your clothes.\n&ldquo;I need you to take this fucking thing off&rdquo; You feel obliged, taking your\nclothes and watching Carol doing the same with hers too.</p><p>Both of you naked, you press your body against Carol again and the\nreaction of both is instant as you feel your skin against her. You can feel\nCarol&rsquo;s arousal between her legs as you press your right thigh, brushing\nCarol&rsquo;s center with it. And you can help but moan at how wet Carol is for you.</p><p>You connect your lips again and you hand goes straight to Carol&rsquo;s left\nbreast, kneading it against your palm. Carol moans against your lips, arching\nher body upwards to feel you, you pinch her nipple with your thumb and\nforefinger, rolling them around it, feeling it harden.</p><p>Your leave her lips and kiss her neck, feeling Carol&rsquo;s body arching with\nher head thrown out, giving you better access to her neck. You bit, suck and\nlick causing exquisite sounds to come out of Carol&rsquo;s mouth.</p><p><a></a>You make a trail of kisses downward from her throat\nto the middle of her chest, your left hand still playing with her left nipple\nand your right hand entwined with Carol&rsquo;s finger above your head.</p><p><a></a>Slowly, your lips find her\nother nipple and soon enough you are making circles against it with your\ntongue. Carol is writhing so much that you think she&rsquo;s about to come only at\nthe feel of your tongue on her nipple.</p><p><a></a>&ldquo;(Y/N)&rdquo; Carol&rsquo;s tone came\nout as a plea, and you know how much she is in need, so you move downwards,\nleaving a trail of kisses toward her abdomen, to the insides of her thighs.</p><p><a></a>You can smell her arousal\nand you feel more turn on at the scent. You grip her thighs, spread them wider\nand you see her center glistening and so wet, you moan and kiss the insides of\nthe thighs and you look at Carol, she&rsquo;s looking back at you with hooded eyes,\nher hair is disheveled and her mouth slightly open with her chest rising and\nfalling rapidly.</p><p><a></a>She is so beautiful and you\ncan&rsquo;t help but fall in love with her more.</p><p><a></a>You both smile at the same time\nand not wanting to wait any longer you press your mouth against Carol&rsquo;s clit\nand her hips involuntarily lift.</p><p><a></a>You swipe your tongue\nagainst her opening towards her clit in one swift motion. Carol&rsquo;s hand grasps\nyour hair.</p><p><a></a>&ldquo;(Y/N)&rdquo; She whispers again,\nwanting to feel more.</p><p><a></a>You comply and you focus on\nher clit, circling it repeatedly, enjoying Carol&rsquo;s arousal on your chin. You\nsuck on it and Carol&rsquo;s hips buckle, her hands pulling your hair harshly,\nmumbling &ldquo;Fuck&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh my God&rdquo; &ldquo;(Y/N)&rdquo;.</p><p><a></a>You repeat that motion until\nyou are sure Carol is close to the edge, but not yet close enough to reach the\npeak of her pleasure. </p><p><a></a>&ldquo;Mmmm (Y/N)&hellip; baby&rdquo; Carol\nsounds desperate and you know that she needs her release so bad. &ldquo;Please&hellip;&rdquo; She\nis breathing heavily and she&rsquo;s locking you with her legs on your neck,\ndesperate for the contact that you are not giving her. &ldquo;I need you inside&hellip;\nright now&hellip; or I swear to&hellip; OH MY GOD!&rdquo; Carol screams as you finally slid two\nfingers inside her, so easily because of how wet Carol is.</p><p><a></a>You moan against her center,\nand you feel Carol shaking at the vibrations that sends towards her body. &ldquo;Mmm\ndon&rsquo;t stop baby&hellip;&rdquo; Carol mutters, as your actions catch pace. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t\nstop&rdquo; Carol was so close to breaking apart.</p><p><a></a>The simultaneous movement\nof your tongue and fingers against her was bringing Carol so close to the point\nof no return and you decide to add another finger at the same time you suck\nCarol&rsquo;s clit and you feel her shaking and having convulsions, muttering\nnonsense while her eyes are close tightly.</p><p><a></a>You keep moving inside of\nher again, you feel her walls clenching against your fingers again and you see\nher abdomen clenching tightly in anticipation of another earth-shattering\nrelease. </p><p><a></a>&ldquo;Mmmm fuck, fuck, fuck&hellip;\n(Y/N)!!!&rdquo; Carol is biting her hand, trying to prevent that the neighbors hear\nanything. You just smirk, you know that the entire building has already heard\nyou. </p><p><a></a>&ldquo;(Y/N), I&rsquo;m cumming. Oh my\nGod&hellip; I&rsquo;m going to cum&hellip;&rdquo; Carol is now meeting your thrusts with her hips. You\ngive her three more thrusts before she was convulsing again, making this orgasm\nstronger that the previous one.</p><p><a></a>Slowly you make your way\ntoward her and you kiss her softly on the lips, Carol moans feeling herself on\nyour lips. Then you start moving slowly your fingers that remained inside of\nher again until you hear Carol&rsquo;s voice.</p><p><a></a>&ldquo;(Y/N), I can&rsquo;t take\nanymore&rdquo; She shook her head, she looks tired.</p><p><a></a>But you have no plans of\nstopping, so get close to her ear and whisper to her sending shivers down her\nbody, &ldquo;Yes, you can&hellip; you are Captain Marvel.&rdquo; Then you bit her earlobe and you\nkiss her again on the lips, moving again your fingers. Hitting her spot\nrepeatedly, her hips moving with you as she rocks her body against your hand\nmaking you push your fingers deeper inside of her.</p><p><a></a>&ldquo;Fuck&hellip; (Y/N)!!!&rdquo; Carol\nscreams as she wraps her arms on you, pulling you impossible closer to her, her\nnails scratching your back, you feel her fist getting hotter, but you are only\nworry to give her another orgasm so you don&rsquo;t really care, besides you can\nhandle her.</p><p><a></a>Moans and incoherent words\nare coming out Carol&rsquo;s mouth and it&rsquo;s music to your ears, encouraging you to\ngive her another orgasm.</p><p><a></a>You can feel things getting\nhotter &ldquo;Let go baby&hellip; I got you&rdquo; You whisper again on her ear when you feel her\nholding back and as soon as she hears you, she lets a final scream, her walls\ntightening around your fingers and you see her orgasm hitting her as soon as\nshe starts glowing again and you feel a little explosion.</p><p><a></a>You close your eyes and\nwhen you open it again, you can see the sheets are totally burned out as well\nas part of the headset.

You close your eyes\nand kiss her forehead. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for not spending that much time with you&hellip; I\nknow that missions and saving people is important, but you are important too&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p><a></a>&ldquo;Ssshhh&rdquo; Carol stops you\nwith a chase kiss on your lips. Her arms wraps around you too, running her\nfingers up and down your back. &ldquo;I know I was out of control&hellip; I was too horny to\nthink straight and I couldn&rsquo;t wait anymore.&rdquo; She chuckles and you can&rsquo;t help\nbut laugh too.</p><p><a></a>Carol smiles and she looks\nso beautiful.</p><p><a></a>&ldquo;I love you Carol&rdquo; You say,\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here now and I&rsquo;m not going anywhere.&rdquo;</p><p><a></a>&ldquo;I know&hellip; I love you too\n(Y/N)&rdquo; Carol answers. </p><p><a></a>You kiss her one more time;\nCarol turns her back to you to be the little spoon.

        "body": "<h1>My Captain Marvel Review</h1><p>Before I do this, I want to clarify a few things. There are going to be both personal opinions on the character and simple objective observations from a different perspective that what most people are doing in defense of this character. \u00a0I am not sexist. I am not racist. I am not misogynistic. I do not identify with the Alt-Right and consider myself a centrist. I believe that modern Feminism (Contrary to Classical Egalitarian-Feminism) is a toxin in society and now it has translated into the MCU through her movie.\u00a0</p><p>I just wanted to put this out there first because any time I make any sort of evaluation of her movie or her as a character I get bombarded with hate, personal attacks, and people telling me why I hated the movie or something when they don&rsquo;t personally know me and aren&rsquo;t me. (You just hate strong female characters! Bitch, go look at my profile. I fucking LOVED Rescue, SCARLET FUCKING WITCH, and Nebula is literally one of my most favorite characters in the MCU&hellip; They were ALL badass in End Game)</p><p>So if you like her as a character and if you like her movie, please do not think that my observations of her or her movie are a personal attack against you. I&rsquo;ve had so many people take my viewpoint personally for some reason and it no longer is a debate as they close their minds off to anything I say and start becoming immediately dismissive. I mean no disrespect in any of my viewpoints. I just feel like I needed to put this out there because&hellip; again&hellip; more often then not I&rsquo;m dealing with some radical feminist that will foam at the mouth and protect her beloved character from any opposing viewpoint irrationally.</p><p>Lastly&hellip;</p><p>PLEASE. DO. NOT. REBLOG. WITH. A. REBUTTAL. AND. BLOCK. ME. LIKE. A. COWARD.\u00a0</p><p>FUCKING. @. ME.\u00a0</p><p>I\u2019M JUST LOOKING FOR SOMEONE WITH A BRAIN TO GIVE ME A GOOD COUNTER ARGUMENT TO THIS.</p><p><b>Okay, so, I personally believe that Captain Marvel and her movie were a toxic addition to the franchise.</b> This is going to be a little long, obviously, but I would appreciate it of you read through. Clearly you don&rsquo;t have to because it is a huge ass wall of text but taking in viewpoints that aren\u2019t constantly validating your own is HEALTHY&hellip; So please read?</p><p><b>Firstly, they retconned the Skrull</b>, that are one of the most recognizable villainous races in all of fiction like Klingons and Orcs, to be refugees of a war that they&rsquo;d lost. In the comics they have 100% control of the Andromeda Galaxy as one massive Empire and the Kree were definitely not in the position to eradicate the Skrulls. They could put up a good fight, but I feel that the Skrulls were too well fortified in Andromeda to really be defeated by the Kree. That&rsquo;s the first, shortest, issue I disliked about the movie. They nerfed the hell out of the Skrulls to being simple refugees&hellip; and innocent. I&rsquo;m sorry, but no&hellip; This is like going into the Star Trek Universe and retconning the Klingons to be some peace loving hippies. They were also some of the most human characters in the entire movie besides Nick and the Black Best friend. (I can&rsquo;t remember her name&hellip; she didn&rsquo;t stand out to me.) They were DEFINITELY more human than Carol Danvers herself. The moment when Talos goes to his family on Mar-Vells ship and hugs them was definitely the most human part of the entire film and it cemented my thoughts on the character. My favorite character in the entire movie was Talos. A lot more likable, interesting, and funny than Carol Danvers was&hellip; I wish the movie had entirely about him at this point because it would have been a better film by FAR. </p><p><b>Secondly, the themes.</b> There was a clear message that this movie was trying to sell long before it even hit theaters, and that was Modern Feminism. The Air Force advertisements featuring female pilots, the girl-power advertisements, and so on. The movie was clearly trying have a target audience of young women or young girls and there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that. However, I started to feel a bit off put by the movie when it showed literally ever male human character that wasn&rsquo;t Nick, Coulson, or the Skrull Leader, Talos, was a sexist prick. LITERALLY every single one of them were sexist. Even her Father. I understand in the comics her and her father never got along or something of that nature, but I personally feel that if they wanted to push the whole sexism narrative that they should have lead it with her father and kept it with her father. Instead they extended the narrative to every male in the entire movie and in her flashbacks. </p><p>I feel there needs to be a specific section on the flashbacks alone. Okay, so, in her flashbacks quite literally every single bad thing that happened to her was because of a man. </p><p>Carol was riding in that Go Kart and the boy told her she was going too fast. Of course in a feminist movie we can&rsquo;t have a girl listen to what a boy has to say, even if he may know more about what she was doing than she did, and so she goes and crashes horrifically. I thought it was a brutal crash. </p><p>A second later and her Dad appears looking down at his busted up and bleeding daughter, that I&rsquo;d be taking to a hospital in a heartbeat, saying that she didn&rsquo;t belong there. </p><p>Okay, that alone is unrealistic to me to begin with. There are a VERY few fathers out there that would have the first words coming out of their mouth being that she didn&rsquo;t belong to be out there. It would be about her health, asking if she was okay, and they would be looking her over as best as possible. However, I will agree with the Father&rsquo;s initial comment that she didn&rsquo;t belong out there on the track. Why? Well I wouldn&rsquo;t want my daughter, who was too stubborn to listen to a boy that was giving good advice when she was doing something dangerous, to do anything dangerous again. Damn right she doesn&rsquo;t belong in dangerous, male, situations and jobs if she&rsquo;s going to act that way. The girl is going to get herself killed. </p><p>Then there&rsquo;s the whole, &lsquo;You know what it&rsquo;s called a cockpit, right?&rsquo; scene and that alone, while not improbable, was unneeded at this point. We already had two male characters expressing their inherent, evil, sexism. Oh, but they went even further than that and got the motorcycle guy in there as well telling her to smile and everything. (Woulda been the first smile in that movie so far at that point for Brie.) While that does happen they\u2019re continuing to beat a dead horse\u2026 Then later on it shows her being bullied on a beach when she\u2019s REALLY little by BOYS he knock her down. </p><p>Then in Basic Training they\u2019re all yelling out to her that she\u2019s gonna die or and things of that nature are more or less unrealistic as well. My father was in the military and was going through basic around the same time that she was and he went into the same branch. The Air Force. When you go into the military they tell you that you are to be colorblind. That you are to be ONE force. ONE unit. You are a team and NOTHING should stand in the way of that. The means that racism, sexism, or any sort of predisposed idealism that puts on person down while raising another up is to be crushed and blown away like dust in the wind. It has no place in the Military as it reduces its effectiveness. So in that training scene where they\u2019re yelling at Carol that she\u2019s going to die and that she\u2019s going to fail is NOT a proper representation of what happens in basic training. Maybe the Drill Instructors to stress you out or drill it into you that what your doing is dangerous and the military itself is dangerous, but not by your fellow team members. If anything your fellow team members are supportive because there are group punishments for your weakest link in your unit\u2026 If they fail, you all fail. If one person is stupid, you ALL get punished for their stupidity. So for her fellow trainees to be putting her down like that makes next to no sense and it is CLEARLY intimating the issue of women in the workplace not being able to do what a man can do or women simply being put down in the workplace for simply being women. </p><p>So, I don&rsquo;t necessarily agree with the route in which they went about the topic of sexism. The execution and presentation were not done well in my opinion. While you may have felt it resonated with you, what about the boys and the men? </p><p>Marvel Movies have always been oriented towards everyone. They&rsquo;ve been family movies. Not one Marvel Movie has been solely and strictly for men. Why? Because movies with male leads don&rsquo;t focus on the fact that they are MALE leads&hellip; There&rsquo;s nothing special about a male lead or male actor in a film. They don&rsquo;t feel the need to point it out or make the male actor into a champion for men and masculinity. </p><p>So, again, what does this film tell you about men? It tells you what I&rsquo;ve described. That men are sexist oppressors that want nothing more than to see women fail, smile, and do what they say. That men think women can&rsquo;t do the same job that a man can and that women aren&rsquo;t as strong as men. That&rsquo;s a message that is being conveyed here&hellip; and that&rsquo;s the ONLY message you get on the subject. That&rsquo;s the bottom line. There&rsquo;s no, 'but not all men-&rsquo; in this film. There&rsquo;s no redemption act, representation (I know a lot of you love that word so here you go&hellip; You won\u2019t like it cause I\u2019m using it in a way you disagree with it.), or presentation of the fact that men will stand for women in face of true sexism. There isn&rsquo;t any sort of male role model to learn from in the film. Nick is there for comedic relief, Coulson is barely in the film, and the Skrull isn&rsquo;t even human. There&rsquo;s no outreach to TEACH boys and young men that sexism is bad. It simply states that men are sexist. That&rsquo;s literally it. This movie was for girls and girls alone, which is a failure in and of itself on the side of Marvel, and it is simply teaching them that men will do this. That boys will do this. There&rsquo;s nothing there to teach boys to not do that or any sort of redeeming quality for men in the film at all. Is this wrong?</p><p>So, yes, if you think it presented the female experience realistically, which I felt it did not in certain scenes, than I am not one to try and change your mind. I&rsquo;ve never been in a woman&rsquo;s shoes and I&rsquo;ve never experienced sexism from men like that. I&rsquo;ll let my opinions stand for themselves. </p><p>While I agree that sexism is truly a problem in society and still lingers, I simply feel that it wasn&rsquo;t presented well enough. That&rsquo;s my main issue with sexism in this film.</p><p>On a personal level I felt that if you\u2019re a guy going to see this movie that you should prepare to feel like an asshole. The entire film is intimating that men are oppressing women, that men see women as objects that need to smile more, that women aren\u2019t as strong as a guy or can\u2019t do what a guy can do. It puts men in a bad light and sort of validates the Modern Feminist talking points and agendas that all men are evil, shallow, vile creatures that want to oppress women because they think that they are objects and aren\u2019t as tough, strong, or brave as men. </p><p>(If Marvel had made a Movie about a Man that acted arrogant, cold, emotionless, and super super super strong and made all the female characters in his past trying to put him down, were annoying, were emotionally manipulative and controlling, were emotionally abusive, were using men for their wealth or income, and were lying cheaters with no sort of redemption character for women to prove things differently I think that this movie would have tanked.)</p><p><b>Thirdly, a shallow Carol Danvers.</b> With all that being said up above, I feel like that all that made her character VERY shallow. The ONLY reason she\u2019s a pilot, the ONLY reason she\u2019s \u2018strong independent woman\u2019, the ONLY reason why she\u2019s a hero is because she\u2019s a woman that\u2019s been put down by men her entire life. To prove that she can be a strong independent woman, and that men can\u2019t keep her down anymore. It\u2019s a consistent attitude of hers to challenge men regardless of who they are or to act arrogant towards them as when first seen by Nick Fury. Immediately upon seeing him she acts a bit sassy, or arrogant, because Nick isn\u2019t knowledgeable about the alien conflicts that exists or doesn\u2019t believe her about the shapeshifting Skrulls. This entire issue sort of cheapens the character as well because if you created the character with the sole purpose to be a conduit or avatar for feminism and feminist talking points\u2026 where do you go from there? All of her personality traits, all of her history, and everything that made Carol Danvers who she is about the oppressive nature of men. Once that is solved, which it is in her movie after she gains the full scale of her powers, where do you go from there? </p><p>For example in the Amazing Spider Man movies with Andrew Garfield his story was that his parents had died a long time ago and he knew nothing about them. After discovering some papers belonging to his father it becomes a story about self-discovery. To learn about his parents and what happened to them. To understand and connect with them in the only way he could which was through Dr. Conners. Later, since he is on this journey of discovery about his father and mother\u2019s demise, he forgets to walk Aunt May home and Uncle Ben is mad at him for not remembering to do this and that he needs to start being responsible. Peter gets frustrated because this relates to his own past and current journey of understanding. To his father. Why did his father die? Why was he sent to his Aunt and Uncle&rsquo;s house when he had a responsibility to Peter and to be a father? Peter leaves out of this anger and selfishness and Ben attempts to follow. Peter had made his way to a convenience store and was trying to buy some milk but is a few cents short and lets a thief rob the place due to the cashier being somewhat of an asshole about it. While on his search for Peter, Uncle Ben encounters the thief and tries to stop him and that gets him shot. Uncle Ben dies and Peter realizes that it&rsquo;s his fault. That he had the power and strength to do the right thing but simply stood there and did nothing. That is what begins his quest as a Superhero. If a good person has the power to do something to save someone\u2019s life, but doesn\u2019t, are they really a good person? Are they just as bad as the man that pulled the trigger by letting someone die? So that becomes who Peter is. Peter isn\u2019t a hero because he\u2019s a strong white kid who got bit by a weird spider. Peter isn\u2019t a strong hero because he\u2019s a man or because women or men were keeping him down. Peter is a strong hero because he learned the HARD way that if you have the power to stop someone from doing something that could cost an innocent person their life, and do nothing, you\u2019re just as bad as the guy that pulled that trigger\u2026 </p><p>Hell, Shazam\u2019s is, \u2018If you can\u2019t save your family, what kind of Hero are you?\u2019 I\u2019m not sure if I got the wording perfect, but even the REAL Captain Marvel here stands for something that has deeper meaning and truth. Shazam is ALL about family and fighting for them&hellip; </p><p>That is a much deeper, much BETTER, character traits than the simple feminist argument that Brie Larson\u2019s Captain Marvel stands for. That she\u2019s a strong because she\u2019s a woman. That she\u2019s strong because she won\u2019t let men keep her down anymore. That she can do whatever a man can do and do it even better. I simply feel like that cheapens the character and is a very boring, shallow, and limited origin story because throughout a Hero\u2019s career they will be challenged on their morals and the reasoning behind what they do. \u00a0(And GIRL POWER is already something that has been established in Cinema for well over 50 years&hellip;) Batman\u2019s is vengeance versus justice. That is a HUGE topic for the hero and he has been struggling with that issue for decades. An argument could be made towards Shazam that his reason for being a hero and doing good, to protect his family, isn\u2019t FOR his family or BECAUSE his family\u2026 it\u2019s because he\u2019s scared to be alone again. That could be a good inner struggle for Shazam. So what sort of personal beliefs are going to be challenged when it comes to Captain Marvel? What sort of personal dilemma or inner struggle can she possibly go through? Why is she a hero? Cause even if you extend her origin story away from her childhood and to the Kree Empire where she was being trained to be used as a weapon against the Skrull that goes back to the issue of oppression and ties in with the rest of her history. Carol has been oppressed by men, told what to do by men, and has been controlled and used by men (Yon-Rogg is the face of this issue, and once again he\u2019s a man.) for their personal gain and desires. </p><p>I\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s just weak and shallow. There are no further storylines that you can have that sort of validate her reasoning of being a hero without making it some gigantic feminist issue. If the issue isn\u2019t about feminism then she\u2019s simply trying to do the right thing to do the right thing\u2026 and ANYONE can do that. It doesn\u2019t make her special. In fact, there\u2019s nothing really special or ultimately heroic about her. All she is a woman that achieved powers and saved a couple of refugees and declared war on a corrupt Empire. It\u2019s\u2026 weak. Steve Rogers fights for Freedom and fights against Tyranny and was forced to reevaluate America and Shield during Winter Soldier and Civil War. These CHALLENGED his very meaning of being a Hero and what he stood for&hellip; The Hulk and Bruce Banner fight because they\u2019re constantly being hunted to be exploited for their power, and not just by people who want to use him for evil, but also by people that want to his power for good\u2026 the bottom line is Bruce and Hulk fight to escape being used as a chess piece. They just want to be left alone. In this sense they aren\u2019t even a hero, and that makes it even better for them as a character because it makes their choices and issues interesting to say the least\u2026 Black Widow fights because she\u2019s trying to make up for the evils of her past. Tony fights because he wants to protect who he loves most and that he feels he has an obligation to Earth and to protect innocent people from being killed like the ones that were being killed by the weapons he designed to protect them in Iron Man 1. </p><p>I\u2019ll leave that there though. I think the last thing I want to talk about is the Mary Sue aspect of captain Marvel. Just so people don\u2019t immediately hate me for calling her a Mary Sue I\u2019m going to copy and paste the definition. </p><p><b>Mar\u00b7y Sue</b></p><p><i>noun</i></p><p><i>noun</i>: Mary Sue; plural noun: Mary Sues</p><ol><li>(originally in fan fiction) a type of female character who is depicted as unrealistically lacking in flaws or weaknesses.</li></ol><p><i>&ldquo;she was not a \u2018strong woman\u2019 so much as an insufferable Mary Sue&rdquo;</i></p><p>So Captain Marvel is a Superhero and Superheros, in order to make them appealing and relatable, are ALWAYS shown to have flaws, weaknesses, and things about them that make them more human to the target audience. That\u2019s what makes them lovable and likable. That you can relate to them and understand where they are coming from and sympathize with them. That you can watch them grow as a character and enjoy their Hero\u2019s Journey. In this movie Captain Marvel has no character growth. Carol Danvers is literally the same as she was in the beginning as she was in the end except she has all her powers and now she hates the Kree. Carol Danvers has no personality flaws whatsoever except, maybe, arrogance and trust issues, and those aren\u2019t exactly traits you want to share with her. They aren\u2019t healthy character flaws. Besides that she barely has a personality to begin with for there to be any sort of flaws. \u2018She\u2019s spent six years learning to control her emotions,\u2019 I\u2019m sorry, but no. That argument is weak. Just because you learn how to CONTROL your emotions doesn\u2019t mean that you sacrifice your personality in the process. </p><p>So with that being said she has no sort of personality flaw about herself and it is shown in the movie that she has no physical or emotional weaknesses either. In the entire movie the only time she was beaten was because of a surprise attack by Talon. From then on out she has consistently kicked ass, NEVER lost a fight, and NEVER physically struggled against any enemy. Carol was super strong and could NOT be stopped. It sucked any sort of drama or any sort of tension out of the movie. You knew she was going to win and be the hero because at that point nothing could stop her. Carol is a badass woman that could not be stopped. Yay Girl Power! </p><p>The best opportunity for her to have been given a weakness and a struggle was when she unlocked her full potential and had access to ALL of her power. To make her struggle to control it for the entirety of the battle except towards the end when she takes out those nukes sent down from Ronan. Even Peter Quill had issues controlling his powers and was CONSTANTLY being beaten by Ego until Yandu finally told him that he doesn\u2019t control his inner strength and power with his head\u2026 he uses his heart\u2026 and that Power Up that he gets after that, after struggling and losing the ENTIRE movie, is extraordinarily satisfying. You LOVE it when he gets that power up. It\u2019s like how in Wonder Woman she gets that power up after losing Steve and she goes ape shit\u2026 There\u2019s a huge emotional lead up and tipping point in those scenes, but Captain Marvel doesn\u2019t even do that. Instead she simply closes her eyes, and opens them and has complete control of her powers. It was ridiculous too because she hadn\u2019t trained with even a decent percentage of her powers at her disposal before! For six years she just trained with a small itty bitty bit of her powers and then suddenly she has full control over ALL of her power as soon as unlocking it? <b>That\u2019s like a Fireman being trained to put out fires with a garden hose for six years only then to be dragged out to use a full on fire-hose at full power that usually requires more than one person to control and expected to do just fine\u2026. Like, I\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s not how that should have worked. </b>After that point she\u2019s basically Superman and cannot be stopped. There\u2019s no fun to it anymore\u2026 it\u2019s just a boring overpowered character being overpowered simply because she\u2019s a woman\u2026 and this is only going to lead her up to being the hero that fans want to see lose. A LOT of people don\u2019t like Superman because he\u2019s a sort of Gary Stu in a sense and they ALWAYS love seeing him get his ass beat. By Batman, Shazam, Wonder Woman. Everyone enjoys seeing the most powerful man of all get taken down\u2026 Especially if they\u2019re on their high horse like Captain Marvel is with her arrogant ass. </p><p>Oh yeah, the last thing I wanna add\u2026 <b>They had to sex change Mar-Vell, the ORIGINAL Captain Marvel, because, of course, we can\u2019t have a feminist movie with a feminist character that we\u2019re trying to make into a feminist icon look up to a man after all. They had to have her looking up to a female Amelia Earhart sort of character instead of a Red Baron or Wright Brother sort of figure\u2026 That kinda peeved me as well. </b></p><p>So with ALL that being said, I simply think that she\u2019s toxic because her entire character is based off of feminism. Modern Feminism at that. (I draw a line between Classical Egalitarian Feminism that I actually agree with, and Modern Feminism.) The issue is that not everyone agrees with the agenda of Modern Feminism and since she\u2019s now the face of it, they\u2019re just going to see an agenda they hate rather than a character they dislike. They\u2019re going to see the Feminist Icon that they despise and won\u2019t pay attention to her as a character. It\u2019s going to cause a rift in the fan base, as it already has, and if she\u2019s going to be made the face of Marvel like they want her to I can bet you that people are going to be finished with Marvel. Real, TRUE, fans of the MCU, not blue haired normie feminists as I\u2019ve heard them described, are going to feel ostracised for not agreeing with Captain Marvels Politics and the fact that she\u2019s so powerful simply because of girl power. I feel that with the introduction of her as a Feminist Icon that any movie she\u2019s in is going to allude to that and buy into her Girl Power - Ex Machina stuff\u2026 Into the Mary Sue in her and it is going to cheapen every movie forward that she\u2019s in. I mean, people are already talking about not seeing End Game because she\u2019s in it and that they\u2019re afraid she\u2019s going to be the sole reason why the Avengers win\u2026 and frankly I\u2019m afraid that she may be the reason why the Avengers win too and that would bother me a LOT. Not because she\u2019s a woman, not because I hate women, but because she\u2019s a terribly written character with no personality and is beyond arrogant. Especially in the, \u2018Lets get Thanos.\u2019 End Game clip that Marvel Released\u2026 It bothers me a lot\u2026 </p><p>EDIT: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/6byj_uqzGh8\">https://youtu.be/6byj_uqzGh8</a> Here&rsquo;s more proof that she&rsquo;s a Mary Sue in the MCU films&hellip; They buffed the fuck out of her over the MCU Thor who has been nerfed to hell&hellip;. &ldquo;Captain Marvel is MUCH WEAKER than Thor.&rdquo;</p>",

            "comment": "<p><h1>My Captain Marvel Review</h1><p>Before I do this, I want to clarify a few things. There are going to be both personal opinions on the character and simple objective observations from a different perspective that what most people are doing in defense of this character. \u00a0I am not sexist. I am not racist. I am not misogynistic. I do not identify with the Alt-Right and consider myself a centrist. I believe that modern Feminism (Contrary to Classical Egalitarian-Feminism) is a toxin in society and now it has translated into the MCU through her movie.\u00a0</p><p>I just wanted to put this out there first because any time I make any sort of evaluation of her movie or her as a character I get bombarded with hate, personal attacks, and people telling me why I hated the movie or something when they don\u2019t personally know me and aren\u2019t me. (You just hate strong female characters! Bitch, go look at my profile. I fucking LOVED Rescue, SCARLET FUCKING WITCH, and Nebula is literally one of my most favorite characters in the MCU\u2026 They were ALL badass in End Game)</p><p>So if you like her as a character and if you like her movie, please do not think that my observations of her or her movie are a personal attack against you. I\u2019ve had so many people take my viewpoint personally for some reason and it no longer is a debate as they close their minds off to anything I say and start becoming immediately dismissive. I mean no disrespect in any of my viewpoints. I just feel like I needed to put this out there because\u2026 again\u2026 more often then not I\u2019m dealing with some radical feminist that will foam at the mouth and protect her beloved character from any opposing viewpoint irrationally.</p><p>Lastly\u2026</p><p>PLEASE. DO. NOT. REBLOG. WITH. A. REBUTTAL. AND. BLOCK. ME. LIKE. A. COWARD.\u00a0</p><p>FUCKING. @. ME.\u00a0</p><p>I\u2019M JUST LOOKING FOR SOMEONE WITH A BRAIN TO GIVE ME A GOOD COUNTER ARGUMENT TO THIS.</p><p><b>Okay, so, I personally believe that Captain Marvel and her movie were a toxic addition to the franchise.</b> This is going to be a little long, obviously, but I would appreciate it of you read through. Clearly you don\u2019t have to because it is a huge ass wall of text but taking in viewpoints that aren\u2019t constantly validating your own is HEALTHY\u2026 So please read?</p><p><b>Firstly, they retconned the Skrull</b>, that are one of the most recognizable villainous races in all of fiction like Klingons and Orcs, to be refugees of a war that they\u2019d lost. In the comics they have 100% control of the Andromeda Galaxy as one massive Empire and the Kree were definitely not in the position to eradicate the Skrulls. They could put up a good fight, but I feel that the Skrulls were too well fortified in Andromeda to really be defeated by the Kree. That\u2019s the first, shortest, issue I disliked about the movie. They nerfed the hell out of the Skrulls to being simple refugees\u2026 and innocent. I\u2019m sorry, but no\u2026 This is like going into the Star Trek Universe and retconning the Klingons to be some peace loving hippies. They were also some of the most human characters in the entire movie besides Nick and the Black Best friend. (I can\u2019t remember her name\u2026 she didn\u2019t stand out to me.) They were DEFINITELY more human than Carol Danvers herself. The moment when Talos goes to his family on Mar-Vells ship and hugs them was definitely the most human part of the entire film and it cemented my thoughts on the character. My favorite character in the entire movie was Talos. A lot more likable, interesting, and funny than Carol Danvers was\u2026 I wish the movie had entirely about him at this point because it would have been a better film by FAR. </p><p><b>Secondly, the themes.</b> There was a clear message that this movie was trying to sell long before it even hit theaters, and that was Modern Feminism. The Air Force advertisements featuring female pilots, the girl-power advertisements, and so on. The movie was clearly trying have a target audience of young women or young girls and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. However, I started to feel a bit off put by the movie when it showed literally ever male human character that wasn\u2019t Nick, Coulson, or the Skrull Leader, Talos, was a sexist prick. LITERALLY every single one of them were sexist. Even her Father. I understand in the comics her and her father never got along or something of that nature, but I personally feel that if they wanted to push the whole sexism narrative that they should have lead it with her father and kept it with her father. Instead they extended the narrative to every male in the entire movie and in her flashbacks. </p><p>I feel there needs to be a specific section on the flashbacks alone. Okay, so, in her flashbacks quite literally every single bad thing that happened to her was because of a man. </p><p>Carol was riding in that Go Kart and the boy told her she was going too fast. Of course in a feminist movie we can\u2019t have a girl listen to what a boy has to say, even if he may know more about what she was doing than she did, and so she goes and crashes horrifically. I thought it was a brutal crash. </p><p>A second later and her Dad appears looking down at his busted up and bleeding daughter, that I\u2019d be taking to a hospital in a heartbeat, saying that she didn\u2019t belong there. </p><p>Okay, that alone is unrealistic to me to begin with. There are a VERY few fathers out there that would have the first words coming out of their mouth being that she didn\u2019t belong to be out there. It would be about her health, asking if she was okay, and they would be looking her over as best as possible. However, I will agree with the Father\u2019s initial comment that she didn\u2019t belong out there on the track. Why? Well I wouldn\u2019t want my daughter, who was too stubborn to listen to a boy that was giving good advice when she was doing something dangerous, to do anything dangerous again. Damn right she doesn\u2019t belong in dangerous, male, situations and jobs if she\u2019s going to act that way. The girl is going to get herself killed. </p><p>Then there\u2019s the whole, \u2018You know what it\u2019s called a cockpit, right?\u2019 scene and that alone, while not improbable, was unneeded at this point. We already had two male characters expressing their inherent, evil, sexism. Oh, but they went even further than that and got the motorcycle guy in there as well telling her to smile and everything. (Woulda been the first smile in that movie so far at that point for Brie.) While that does happen they\u2019re continuing to beat a dead horse\u2026 Then later on it shows her being bullied on a beach when she\u2019s REALLY little by BOYS he knock her down. </p><p>Then in Basic Training they\u2019re all yelling out to her that she\u2019s gonna die or and things of that nature are more or less unrealistic as well. My father was in the military and was going through basic around the same time that she was and he went into the same branch. The Air Force. When you go into the military they tell you that you are to be colorblind. That you are to be ONE force. ONE unit. You are a team and NOTHING should stand in the way of that. The means that racism, sexism, or any sort of predisposed idealism that puts on person down while raising another up is to be crushed and blown away like dust in the wind. It has no place in the Military as it reduces its effectiveness. So in that training scene where they\u2019re yelling at Carol that she\u2019s going to die and that she\u2019s going to fail is NOT a proper representation of what happens in basic training. Maybe the Drill Instructors to stress you out or drill it into you that what your doing is dangerous and the military itself is dangerous, but not by your fellow team members. If anything your fellow team members are supportive because there are group punishments for your weakest link in your unit\u2026 If they fail, you all fail. If one person is stupid, you ALL get punished for their stupidity. So for her fellow trainees to be putting her down like that makes next to no sense and it is CLEARLY intimating the issue of women in the workplace not being able to do what a man can do or women simply being put down in the workplace for simply being women. </p><p>So, I don\u2019t necessarily agree with the route in which they went about the topic of sexism. The execution and presentation were not done well in my opinion. While you may have felt it resonated with you, what about the boys and the men? </p><p>Marvel Movies have always been oriented towards everyone. They\u2019ve been family movies. Not one Marvel Movie has been solely and strictly for men. Why? Because movies with male leads don\u2019t focus on the fact that they are MALE leads\u2026 There\u2019s nothing special about a male lead or male actor in a film. They don\u2019t feel the need to point it out or make the male actor into a champion for men and masculinity. </p><p>So, again, what does this film tell you about men? It tells you what I\u2019ve described. That men are sexist oppressors that want nothing more than to see women fail, smile, and do what they say. That men think women can\u2019t do the same job that a man can and that women aren\u2019t as strong as men. That\u2019s a message that is being conveyed here\u2026 and that\u2019s the ONLY message you get on the subject. That\u2019s the bottom line. There\u2019s no, 'but not all men-\u2019 in this film. There\u2019s no redemption act, representation (I know a lot of you love that word so here you go\u2026 You won\u2019t like it cause I\u2019m using it in a way you disagree with it.), or presentation of the fact that men will stand for women in face of true sexism. There isn\u2019t any sort of male role model to learn from in the film. Nick is there for comedic relief, Coulson is barely in the film, and the Skrull isn\u2019t even human. There\u2019s no outreach to TEACH boys and young men that sexism is bad. It simply states that men are sexist. That\u2019s literally it. This movie was for girls and girls alone, which is a failure in and of itself on the side of Marvel, and it is simply teaching them that men will do this. That boys will do this. There\u2019s nothing there to teach boys to not do that or any sort of redeeming quality for men in the film at all. Is this wrong?</p><p>So, yes, if you think it presented the female experience realistically, which I felt it did not in certain scenes, than I am not one to try and change your mind. I\u2019ve never been in a woman\u2019s shoes and I\u2019ve never experienced sexism from men like that. I\u2019ll let my opinions stand for themselves. </p><p>While I agree that sexism is truly a problem in society and still lingers, I simply feel that it wasn\u2019t presented well enough. That\u2019s my main issue with sexism in this film.</p><p>On a personal level I felt that if you\u2019re a guy going to see this movie that you should prepare to feel like an asshole. The entire film is intimating that men are oppressing women, that men see women as objects that need to smile more, that women aren\u2019t as strong as a guy or can\u2019t do what a guy can do. It puts men in a bad light and sort of validates the Modern Feminist talking points and agendas that all men are evil, shallow, vile creatures that want to oppress women because they think that they are objects and aren\u2019t as tough, strong, or brave as men. </p><p>(If Marvel had made a Movie about a Man that acted arrogant, cold, emotionless, and super super super strong and made all the female characters in his past trying to put him down, were annoying, were emotionally manipulative and controlling, were emotionally abusive, were using men for their wealth or income, and were lying cheaters with no sort of redemption character for women to prove things differently I think that this movie would have tanked.)</p><p><b>Thirdly, a shallow Carol Danvers.</b> With all that being said up above, I feel like that all that made her character VERY shallow. The ONLY reason she\u2019s a pilot, the ONLY reason she\u2019s \u2018strong independent woman\u2019, the ONLY reason why she\u2019s a hero is because she\u2019s a woman that\u2019s been put down by men her entire life. To prove that she can be a strong independent woman, and that men can\u2019t keep her down anymore. It\u2019s a consistent attitude of hers to challenge men regardless of who they are or to act arrogant towards them as when first seen by Nick Fury. Immediately upon seeing him she acts a bit sassy, or arrogant, because Nick isn\u2019t knowledgeable about the alien conflicts that exists or doesn\u2019t believe her about the shapeshifting Skrulls. This entire issue sort of cheapens the character as well because if you created the character with the sole purpose to be a conduit or avatar for feminism and feminist talking points\u2026 where do you go from there? All of her personality traits, all of her history, and everything that made Carol Danvers who she is about the oppressive nature of men. Once that is solved, which it is in her movie after she gains the full scale of her powers, where do you go from there? </p><p>For example in the Amazing Spider Man movies with Andrew Garfield his story was that his parents had died a long time ago and he knew nothing about them. After discovering some papers belonging to his father it becomes a story about self-discovery. To learn about his parents and what happened to them. To understand and connect with them in the only way he could which was through Dr. Conners. Later, since he is on this journey of discovery about his father and mother\u2019s demise, he forgets to walk Aunt May home and Uncle Ben is mad at him for not remembering to do this and that he needs to start being responsible. Peter gets frustrated because this relates to his own past and current journey of understanding. To his father. Why did his father die? Why was he sent to his Aunt and Uncle\u2019s house when he had a responsibility to Peter and to be a father? Peter leaves out of this anger and selfishness and Ben attempts to follow. Peter had made his way to a convenience store and was trying to buy some milk but is a few cents short and lets a thief rob the place due to the cashier being somewhat of an asshole about it. While on his search for Peter, Uncle Ben encounters the thief and tries to stop him and that gets him shot. Uncle Ben dies and Peter realizes that it\u2019s his fault. That he had the power and strength to do the right thing but simply stood there and did nothing. That is what begins his quest as a Superhero. If a good person has the power to do something to save someone\u2019s life, but doesn\u2019t, are they really a good person? Are they just as bad as the man that pulled the trigger by letting someone die? So that becomes who Peter is. Peter isn\u2019t a hero because he\u2019s a strong white kid who got bit by a weird spider. Peter isn\u2019t a strong hero because he\u2019s a man or because women or men were keeping him down. Peter is a strong hero because he learned the HARD way that if you have the power to stop someone from doing something that could cost an innocent person their life, and do nothing, you\u2019re just as bad as the guy that pulled that trigger\u2026 </p><p>Hell, Shazam\u2019s is, \u2018If you can\u2019t save your family, what kind of Hero are you?\u2019 I\u2019m not sure if I got the wording perfect, but even the REAL Captain Marvel here stands for something that has deeper meaning and truth. Shazam is ALL about family and fighting for them\u2026 </p><p>That is a much deeper, much BETTER, character traits than the simple feminist argument that Brie Larson\u2019s Captain Marvel stands for. That she\u2019s a strong because she\u2019s a woman. That she\u2019s strong because she won\u2019t let men keep her down anymore. That she can do whatever a man can do and do it even better. I simply feel like that cheapens the character and is a very boring, shallow, and limited origin story because throughout a Hero\u2019s career they will be challenged on their morals and the reasoning behind what they do. \u00a0(And GIRL POWER is already something that has been established in Cinema for well over 50 years\u2026) Batman\u2019s is vengeance versus justice. That is a HUGE topic for the hero and he has been struggling with that issue for decades. An argument could be made towards Shazam that his reason for being a hero and doing good, to protect his family, isn\u2019t FOR his family or BECAUSE his family\u2026 it\u2019s because he\u2019s scared to be alone again. That could be a good inner struggle for Shazam. So what sort of personal beliefs are going to be challenged when it comes to Captain Marvel? What sort of personal dilemma or inner struggle can she possibly go through? Why is she a hero? Cause even if you extend her origin story away from her childhood and to the Kree Empire where she was being trained to be used as a weapon against the Skrull that goes back to the issue of oppression and ties in with the rest of her history. Carol has been oppressed by men, told what to do by men, and has been controlled and used by men (Yon-Rogg is the face of this issue, and once again he\u2019s a man.) for their personal gain and desires. </p><p>I\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s just weak and shallow. There are no further storylines that you can have that sort of validate her reasoning of being a hero without making it some gigantic feminist issue. If the issue isn\u2019t about feminism then she\u2019s simply trying to do the right thing to do the right thing\u2026 and ANYONE can do that. It doesn\u2019t make her special. In fact, there\u2019s nothing really special or ultimately heroic about her. All she is a woman that achieved powers and saved a couple of refugees and declared war on a corrupt Empire. It\u2019s\u2026 weak. Steve Rogers fights for Freedom and fights against Tyranny and was forced to reevaluate America and Shield during Winter Soldier and Civil War. These CHALLENGED his very meaning of being a Hero and what he stood for\u2026 The Hulk and Bruce Banner fight because they\u2019re constantly being hunted to be exploited for their power, and not just by people who want to use him for evil, but also by people that want to his power for good\u2026 the bottom line is Bruce and Hulk fight to escape being used as a chess piece. They just want to be left alone. In this sense they aren\u2019t even a hero, and that makes it even better for them as a character because it makes their choices and issues interesting to say the least\u2026 Black Widow fights because she\u2019s trying to make up for the evils of her past. Tony fights because he wants to protect who he loves most and that he feels he has an obligation to Earth and to protect innocent people from being killed like the ones that were being killed by the weapons he designed to protect them in Iron Man 1. </p><p>I\u2019ll leave that there though. I think the last thing I want to talk about is the Mary Sue aspect of captain Marvel. Just so people don\u2019t immediately hate me for calling her a Mary Sue I\u2019m going to copy and paste the definition. </p><p><b>Mar\u00b7y Sue</b></p><p><i>noun</i></p><p><i>noun</i>: Mary Sue; plural noun: Mary Sues</p><ol><li>(originally in fan fiction) a type of female character who is depicted as unrealistically lacking in flaws or weaknesses.</li></ol><p><i>\u201cshe was not a \u2018strong woman\u2019 so much as an insufferable Mary Sue\u201d</i></p><p>So Captain Marvel is a Superhero and Superheros, in order to make them appealing and relatable, are ALWAYS shown to have flaws, weaknesses, and things about them that make them more human to the target audience. That\u2019s what makes them lovable and likable. That you can relate to them and understand where they are coming from and sympathize with them. That you can watch them grow as a character and enjoy their Hero\u2019s Journey. In this movie Captain Marvel has no character growth. Carol Danvers is literally the same as she was in the beginning as she was in the end except she has all her powers and now she hates the Kree. Carol Danvers has no personality flaws whatsoever except, maybe, arrogance and trust issues, and those aren\u2019t exactly traits you want to share with her. They aren\u2019t healthy character flaws. Besides that she barely has a personality to begin with for there to be any sort of flaws. \u2018She\u2019s spent six years learning to control her emotions,\u2019 I\u2019m sorry, but no. That argument is weak. Just because you learn how to CONTROL your emotions doesn\u2019t mean that you sacrifice your personality in the process. </p><p>So with that being said she has no sort of personality flaw about herself and it is shown in the movie that she has no physical or emotional weaknesses either. In the entire movie the only time she was beaten was because of a surprise attack by Talon. From then on out she has consistently kicked ass, NEVER lost a fight, and NEVER physically struggled against any enemy. Carol was super strong and could NOT be stopped. It sucked any sort of drama or any sort of tension out of the movie. You knew she was going to win and be the hero because at that point nothing could stop her. Carol is a badass woman that could not be stopped. Yay Girl Power! </p><p>The best opportunity for her to have been given a weakness and a struggle was when she unlocked her full potential and had access to ALL of her power. To make her struggle to control it for the entirety of the battle except towards the end when she takes out those nukes sent down from Ronan. Even Peter Quill had issues controlling his powers and was CONSTANTLY being beaten by Ego until Yandu finally told him that he doesn\u2019t control his inner strength and power with his head\u2026 he uses his heart\u2026 and that Power Up that he gets after that, after struggling and losing the ENTIRE movie, is extraordinarily satisfying. You LOVE it when he gets that power up. It\u2019s like how in Wonder Woman she gets that power up after losing Steve and she goes ape shit\u2026 There\u2019s a huge emotional lead up and tipping point in those scenes, but Captain Marvel doesn\u2019t even do that. Instead she simply closes her eyes, and opens them and has complete control of her powers. It was ridiculous too because she hadn\u2019t trained with even a decent percentage of her powers at her disposal before! For six years she just trained with a small itty bitty bit of her powers and then suddenly she has full control over ALL of her power as soon as unlocking it? <b>That\u2019s like a Fireman being trained to put out fires with a garden hose for six years only then to be dragged out to use a full on fire-hose at full power that usually requires more than one person to control and expected to do just fine\u2026. Like, I\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s not how that should have worked. </b>After that point she\u2019s basically Superman and cannot be stopped. There\u2019s no fun to it anymore\u2026 it\u2019s just a boring overpowered character being overpowered simply because she\u2019s a woman\u2026 and this is only going to lead her up to being the hero that fans want to see lose. A LOT of people don\u2019t like Superman because he\u2019s a sort of Gary Stu in a sense and they ALWAYS love seeing him get his ass beat. By Batman, Shazam, Wonder Woman. Everyone enjoys seeing the most powerful man of all get taken down\u2026 Especially if they\u2019re on their high horse like Captain Marvel is with her arrogant ass. </p><p>Oh yeah, the last thing I wanna add\u2026 <b>They had to sex change Mar-Vell, the ORIGINAL Captain Marvel, because, of course, we can\u2019t have a feminist movie with a feminist character that we\u2019re trying to make into a feminist icon look up to a man after all. They had to have her looking up to a female Amelia Earhart sort of character instead of a Red Baron or Wright Brother sort of figure\u2026 That kinda peeved me as well. </b></p><p>So with ALL that being said, I simply think that she\u2019s toxic because her entire character is based off of feminism. Modern Feminism at that. (I draw a line between Classical Egalitarian Feminism that I actually agree with, and Modern Feminism.) The issue is that not everyone agrees with the agenda of Modern Feminism and since she\u2019s now the face of it, they\u2019re just going to see an agenda they hate rather than a character they dislike. They\u2019re going to see the Feminist Icon that they despise and won\u2019t pay attention to her as a character. It\u2019s going to cause a rift in the fan base, as it already has, and if she\u2019s going to be made the face of Marvel like they want her to I can bet you that people are going to be finished with Marvel. Real, TRUE, fans of the MCU, not blue haired normie feminists as I\u2019ve heard them described, are going to feel ostracised for not agreeing with Captain Marvels Politics and the fact that she\u2019s so powerful simply because of girl power. I feel that with the introduction of her as a Feminist Icon that any movie she\u2019s in is going to allude to that and buy into her Girl Power - Ex Machina stuff\u2026 Into the Mary Sue in her and it is going to cheapen every movie forward that she\u2019s in. I mean, people are already talking about not seeing End Game because she\u2019s in it and that they\u2019re afraid she\u2019s going to be the sole reason why the Avengers win\u2026 and frankly I\u2019m afraid that she may be the reason why the Avengers win too and that would bother me a LOT. Not because she\u2019s a woman, not because I hate women, but because she\u2019s a terribly written character with no personality and is beyond arrogant. Especially in the, \u2018Lets get Thanos.\u2019 End Game clip that Marvel Released\u2026 It bothers me a lot\u2026 </p><p>EDIT: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/6byj_uqzGh8\">https://youtu.be/6byj_uqzGh8</a> Here\u2019s more proof that she\u2019s a Mary Sue in the MCU films\u2026 They buffed the fuck out of her over the MCU Thor who has been nerfed to hell\u2026. \u201cCaptain Marvel is MUCH WEAKER than Thor.\u201d</p></p>",

                "content_raw": "<p><h1>My Captain Marvel Review</h1><p>Before I do this, I want to clarify a few things. There are going to be both personal opinions on the character and simple objective observations from a different perspective that what most people are doing in defense of this character. \u00a0I am not sexist. I am not racist. I am not misogynistic. I do not identify with the Alt-Right and consider myself a centrist. I believe that modern Feminism (Contrary to Classical Egalitarian-Feminism) is a toxin in society and now it has translated into the MCU through her movie.\u00a0</p><p>I just wanted to put this out there first because any time I make any sort of evaluation of her movie or her as a character I get bombarded with hate, personal attacks, and people telling me why I hated the movie or something when they don\u2019t personally know me and aren\u2019t me. (You just hate strong female characters! Bitch, go look at my profile. I fucking LOVED Rescue, SCARLET FUCKING WITCH, and Nebula is literally one of my most favorite characters in the MCU\u2026 They were ALL badass in End Game)</p><p>So if you like her as a character and if you like her movie, please do not think that my observations of her or her movie are a personal attack against you. I\u2019ve had so many people take my viewpoint personally for some reason and it no longer is a debate as they close their minds off to anything I say and start becoming immediately dismissive. I mean no disrespect in any of my viewpoints. I just feel like I needed to put this out there because\u2026 again\u2026 more often then not I\u2019m dealing with some radical feminist that will foam at the mouth and protect her beloved character from any opposing viewpoint irrationally.</p><p>Lastly\u2026</p><p>PLEASE. DO. NOT. REBLOG. WITH. A. REBUTTAL. AND. BLOCK. ME. LIKE. A. COWARD.\u00a0</p><p>FUCKING. @. ME.\u00a0</p><p>I\u2019M JUST LOOKING FOR SOMEONE WITH A BRAIN TO GIVE ME A GOOD COUNTER ARGUMENT TO THIS.</p><p><b>Okay, so, I personally believe that Captain Marvel and her movie were a toxic addition to the franchise.</b> This is going to be a little long, obviously, but I would appreciate it of you read through. Clearly you don\u2019t have to because it is a huge ass wall of text but taking in viewpoints that aren\u2019t constantly validating your own is HEALTHY\u2026 So please read?</p><p><b>Firstly, they retconned the Skrull</b>, that are one of the most recognizable villainous races in all of fiction like Klingons and Orcs, to be refugees of a war that they\u2019d lost. In the comics they have 100% control of the Andromeda Galaxy as one massive Empire and the Kree were definitely not in the position to eradicate the Skrulls. They could put up a good fight, but I feel that the Skrulls were too well fortified in Andromeda to really be defeated by the Kree. That\u2019s the first, shortest, issue I disliked about the movie. They nerfed the hell out of the Skrulls to being simple refugees\u2026 and innocent. I\u2019m sorry, but no\u2026 This is like going into the Star Trek Universe and retconning the Klingons to be some peace loving hippies. They were also some of the most human characters in the entire movie besides Nick and the Black Best friend. (I can\u2019t remember her name\u2026 she didn\u2019t stand out to me.) They were DEFINITELY more human than Carol Danvers herself. The moment when Talos goes to his family on Mar-Vells ship and hugs them was definitely the most human part of the entire film and it cemented my thoughts on the character. My favorite character in the entire movie was Talos. A lot more likable, interesting, and funny than Carol Danvers was\u2026 I wish the movie had entirely about him at this point because it would have been a better film by FAR. </p><p><b>Secondly, the themes.</b> There was a clear message that this movie was trying to sell long before it even hit theaters, and that was Modern Feminism. The Air Force advertisements featuring female pilots, the girl-power advertisements, and so on. The movie was clearly trying have a target audience of young women or young girls and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. However, I started to feel a bit off put by the movie when it showed literally ever male human character that wasn\u2019t Nick, Coulson, or the Skrull Leader, Talos, was a sexist prick. LITERALLY every single one of them were sexist. Even her Father. I understand in the comics her and her father never got along or something of that nature, but I personally feel that if they wanted to push the whole sexism narrative that they should have lead it with her father and kept it with her father. Instead they extended the narrative to every male in the entire movie and in her flashbacks. </p><p>I feel there needs to be a specific section on the flashbacks alone. Okay, so, in her flashbacks quite literally every single bad thing that happened to her was because of a man. </p><p>Carol was riding in that Go Kart and the boy told her she was going too fast. Of course in a feminist movie we can\u2019t have a girl listen to what a boy has to say, even if he may know more about what she was doing than she did, and so she goes and crashes horrifically. I thought it was a brutal crash. </p><p>A second later and her Dad appears looking down at his busted up and bleeding daughter, that I\u2019d be taking to a hospital in a heartbeat, saying that she didn\u2019t belong there. </p><p>Okay, that alone is unrealistic to me to begin with. There are a VERY few fathers out there that would have the first words coming out of their mouth being that she didn\u2019t belong to be out there. It would be about her health, asking if she was okay, and they would be looking her over as best as possible. However, I will agree with the Father\u2019s initial comment that she didn\u2019t belong out there on the track. Why? Well I wouldn\u2019t want my daughter, who was too stubborn to listen to a boy that was giving good advice when she was doing something dangerous, to do anything dangerous again. Damn right she doesn\u2019t belong in dangerous, male, situations and jobs if she\u2019s going to act that way. The girl is going to get herself killed. </p><p>Then there\u2019s the whole, \u2018You know what it\u2019s called a cockpit, right?\u2019 scene and that alone, while not improbable, was unneeded at this point. We already had two male characters expressing their inherent, evil, sexism. Oh, but they went even further than that and got the motorcycle guy in there as well telling her to smile and everything. (Woulda been the first smile in that movie so far at that point for Brie.) While that does happen they\u2019re continuing to beat a dead horse\u2026 Then later on it shows her being bullied on a beach when she\u2019s REALLY little by BOYS he knock her down. </p><p>Then in Basic Training they\u2019re all yelling out to her that she\u2019s gonna die or and things of that nature are more or less unrealistic as well. My father was in the military and was going through basic around the same time that she was and he went into the same branch. The Air Force. When you go into the military they tell you that you are to be colorblind. That you are to be ONE force. ONE unit. You are a team and NOTHING should stand in the way of that. The means that racism, sexism, or any sort of predisposed idealism that puts on person down while raising another up is to be crushed and blown away like dust in the wind. It has no place in the Military as it reduces its effectiveness. So in that training scene where they\u2019re yelling at Carol that she\u2019s going to die and that she\u2019s going to fail is NOT a proper representation of what happens in basic training. Maybe the Drill Instructors to stress you out or drill it into you that what your doing is dangerous and the military itself is dangerous, but not by your fellow team members. If anything your fellow team members are supportive because there are group punishments for your weakest link in your unit\u2026 If they fail, you all fail. If one person is stupid, you ALL get punished for their stupidity. So for her fellow trainees to be putting her down like that makes next to no sense and it is CLEARLY intimating the issue of women in the workplace not being able to do what a man can do or women simply being put down in the workplace for simply being women. </p><p>So, I don\u2019t necessarily agree with the route in which they went about the topic of sexism. The execution and presentation were not done well in my opinion. While you may have felt it resonated with you, what about the boys and the men? </p><p>Marvel Movies have always been oriented towards everyone. They\u2019ve been family movies. Not one Marvel Movie has been solely and strictly for men. Why? Because movies with male leads don\u2019t focus on the fact that they are MALE leads\u2026 There\u2019s nothing special about a male lead or male actor in a film. They don\u2019t feel the need to point it out or make the male actor into a champion for men and masculinity. </p><p>So, again, what does this film tell you about men? It tells you what I\u2019ve described. That men are sexist oppressors that want nothing more than to see women fail, smile, and do what they say. That men think women can\u2019t do the same job that a man can and that women aren\u2019t as strong as men. That\u2019s a message that is being conveyed here\u2026 and that\u2019s the ONLY message you get on the subject. That\u2019s the bottom line. There\u2019s no, 'but not all men-\u2019 in this film. There\u2019s no redemption act, representation (I know a lot of you love that word so here you go\u2026 You won\u2019t like it cause I\u2019m using it in a way you disagree with it.), or presentation of the fact that men will stand for women in face of true sexism. There isn\u2019t any sort of male role model to learn from in the film. Nick is there for comedic relief, Coulson is barely in the film, and the Skrull isn\u2019t even human. There\u2019s no outreach to TEACH boys and young men that sexism is bad. It simply states that men are sexist. That\u2019s literally it. This movie was for girls and girls alone, which is a failure in and of itself on the side of Marvel, and it is simply teaching them that men will do this. That boys will do this. There\u2019s nothing there to teach boys to not do that or any sort of redeeming quality for men in the film at all. Is this wrong?</p><p>So, yes, if you think it presented the female experience realistically, which I felt it did not in certain scenes, than I am not one to try and change your mind. I\u2019ve never been in a woman\u2019s shoes and I\u2019ve never experienced sexism from men like that. I\u2019ll let my opinions stand for themselves. </p><p>While I agree that sexism is truly a problem in society and still lingers, I simply feel that it wasn\u2019t presented well enough. That\u2019s my main issue with sexism in this film.</p><p>On a personal level I felt that if you\u2019re a guy going to see this movie that you should prepare to feel like an asshole. The entire film is intimating that men are oppressing women, that men see women as objects that need to smile more, that women aren\u2019t as strong as a guy or can\u2019t do what a guy can do. It puts men in a bad light and sort of validates the Modern Feminist talking points and agendas that all men are evil, shallow, vile creatures that want to oppress women because they think that they are objects and aren\u2019t as tough, strong, or brave as men. </p><p>(If Marvel had made a Movie about a Man that acted arrogant, cold, emotionless, and super super super strong and made all the female characters in his past trying to put him down, were annoying, were emotionally manipulative and controlling, were emotionally abusive, were using men for their wealth or income, and were lying cheaters with no sort of redemption character for women to prove things differently I think that this movie would have tanked.)</p><p><b>Thirdly, a shallow Carol Danvers.</b> With all that being said up above, I feel like that all that made her character VERY shallow. The ONLY reason she\u2019s a pilot, the ONLY reason she\u2019s \u2018strong independent woman\u2019, the ONLY reason why she\u2019s a hero is because she\u2019s a woman that\u2019s been put down by men her entire life. To prove that she can be a strong independent woman, and that men can\u2019t keep her down anymore. It\u2019s a consistent attitude of hers to challenge men regardless of who they are or to act arrogant towards them as when first seen by Nick Fury. Immediately upon seeing him she acts a bit sassy, or arrogant, because Nick isn\u2019t knowledgeable about the alien conflicts that exists or doesn\u2019t believe her about the shapeshifting Skrulls. This entire issue sort of cheapens the character as well because if you created the character with the sole purpose to be a conduit or avatar for feminism and feminist talking points\u2026 where do you go from there? All of her personality traits, all of her history, and everything that made Carol Danvers who she is about the oppressive nature of men. Once that is solved, which it is in her movie after she gains the full scale of her powers, where do you go from there? </p><p>For example in the Amazing Spider Man movies with Andrew Garfield his story was that his parents had died a long time ago and he knew nothing about them. After discovering some papers belonging to his father it becomes a story about self-discovery. To learn about his parents and what happened to them. To understand and connect with them in the only way he could which was through Dr. Conners. Later, since he is on this journey of discovery about his father and mother\u2019s demise, he forgets to walk Aunt May home and Uncle Ben is mad at him for not remembering to do this and that he needs to start being responsible. Peter gets frustrated because this relates to his own past and current journey of understanding. To his father. Why did his father die? Why was he sent to his Aunt and Uncle\u2019s house when he had a responsibility to Peter and to be a father? Peter leaves out of this anger and selfishness and Ben attempts to follow. Peter had made his way to a convenience store and was trying to buy some milk but is a few cents short and lets a thief rob the place due to the cashier being somewhat of an asshole about it. While on his search for Peter, Uncle Ben encounters the thief and tries to stop him and that gets him shot. Uncle Ben dies and Peter realizes that it\u2019s his fault. That he had the power and strength to do the right thing but simply stood there and did nothing. That is what begins his quest as a Superhero. If a good person has the power to do something to save someone\u2019s life, but doesn\u2019t, are they really a good person? Are they just as bad as the man that pulled the trigger by letting someone die? So that becomes who Peter is. Peter isn\u2019t a hero because he\u2019s a strong white kid who got bit by a weird spider. Peter isn\u2019t a strong hero because he\u2019s a man or because women or men were keeping him down. Peter is a strong hero because he learned the HARD way that if you have the power to stop someone from doing something that could cost an innocent person their life, and do nothing, you\u2019re just as bad as the guy that pulled that trigger\u2026 </p><p>Hell, Shazam\u2019s is, \u2018If you can\u2019t save your family, what kind of Hero are you?\u2019 I\u2019m not sure if I got the wording perfect, but even the REAL Captain Marvel here stands for something that has deeper meaning and truth. Shazam is ALL about family and fighting for them\u2026 </p><p>That is a much deeper, much BETTER, character traits than the simple feminist argument that Brie Larson\u2019s Captain Marvel stands for. That she\u2019s a strong because she\u2019s a woman. That she\u2019s strong because she won\u2019t let men keep her down anymore. That she can do whatever a man can do and do it even better. I simply feel like that cheapens the character and is a very boring, shallow, and limited origin story because throughout a Hero\u2019s career they will be challenged on their morals and the reasoning behind what they do. \u00a0(And GIRL POWER is already something that has been established in Cinema for well over 50 years\u2026) Batman\u2019s is vengeance versus justice. That is a HUGE topic for the hero and he has been struggling with that issue for decades. An argument could be made towards Shazam that his reason for being a hero and doing good, to protect his family, isn\u2019t FOR his family or BECAUSE his family\u2026 it\u2019s because he\u2019s scared to be alone again. That could be a good inner struggle for Shazam. So what sort of personal beliefs are going to be challenged when it comes to Captain Marvel? What sort of personal dilemma or inner struggle can she possibly go through? Why is she a hero? Cause even if you extend her origin story away from her childhood and to the Kree Empire where she was being trained to be used as a weapon against the Skrull that goes back to the issue of oppression and ties in with the rest of her history. Carol has been oppressed by men, told what to do by men, and has been controlled and used by men (Yon-Rogg is the face of this issue, and once again he\u2019s a man.) for their personal gain and desires. </p><p>I\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s just weak and shallow. There are no further storylines that you can have that sort of validate her reasoning of being a hero without making it some gigantic feminist issue. If the issue isn\u2019t about feminism then she\u2019s simply trying to do the right thing to do the right thing\u2026 and ANYONE can do that. It doesn\u2019t make her special. In fact, there\u2019s nothing really special or ultimately heroic about her. All she is a woman that achieved powers and saved a couple of refugees and declared war on a corrupt Empire. It\u2019s\u2026 weak. Steve Rogers fights for Freedom and fights against Tyranny and was forced to reevaluate America and Shield during Winter Soldier and Civil War. These CHALLENGED his very meaning of being a Hero and what he stood for\u2026 The Hulk and Bruce Banner fight because they\u2019re constantly being hunted to be exploited for their power, and not just by people who want to use him for evil, but also by people that want to his power for good\u2026 the bottom line is Bruce and Hulk fight to escape being used as a chess piece. They just want to be left alone. In this sense they aren\u2019t even a hero, and that makes it even better for them as a character because it makes their choices and issues interesting to say the least\u2026 Black Widow fights because she\u2019s trying to make up for the evils of her past. Tony fights because he wants to protect who he loves most and that he feels he has an obligation to Earth and to protect innocent people from being killed like the ones that were being killed by the weapons he designed to protect them in Iron Man 1. </p><p>I\u2019ll leave that there though. I think the last thing I want to talk about is the Mary Sue aspect of captain Marvel. Just so people don\u2019t immediately hate me for calling her a Mary Sue I\u2019m going to copy and paste the definition. </p><p><b>Mar\u00b7y Sue</b></p><p><i>noun</i></p><p><i>noun</i>: Mary Sue; plural noun: Mary Sues</p><ol><li>(originally in fan fiction) a type of female character who is depicted as unrealistically lacking in flaws or weaknesses.</li></ol><p><i>\u201cshe was not a \u2018strong woman\u2019 so much as an insufferable Mary Sue\u201d</i></p><p>So Captain Marvel is a Superhero and Superheros, in order to make them appealing and relatable, are ALWAYS shown to have flaws, weaknesses, and things about them that make them more human to the target audience. That\u2019s what makes them lovable and likable. That you can relate to them and understand where they are coming from and sympathize with them. That you can watch them grow as a character and enjoy their Hero\u2019s Journey. In this movie Captain Marvel has no character growth. Carol Danvers is literally the same as she was in the beginning as she was in the end except she has all her powers and now she hates the Kree. Carol Danvers has no personality flaws whatsoever except, maybe, arrogance and trust issues, and those aren\u2019t exactly traits you want to share with her. They aren\u2019t healthy character flaws. Besides that she barely has a personality to begin with for there to be any sort of flaws. \u2018She\u2019s spent six years learning to control her emotions,\u2019 I\u2019m sorry, but no. That argument is weak. Just because you learn how to CONTROL your emotions doesn\u2019t mean that you sacrifice your personality in the process. </p><p>So with that being said she has no sort of personality flaw about herself and it is shown in the movie that she has no physical or emotional weaknesses either. In the entire movie the only time she was beaten was because of a surprise attack by Talon. From then on out she has consistently kicked ass, NEVER lost a fight, and NEVER physically struggled against any enemy. Carol was super strong and could NOT be stopped. It sucked any sort of drama or any sort of tension out of the movie. You knew she was going to win and be the hero because at that point nothing could stop her. Carol is a badass woman that could not be stopped. Yay Girl Power! </p><p>The best opportunity for her to have been given a weakness and a struggle was when she unlocked her full potential and had access to ALL of her power. To make her struggle to control it for the entirety of the battle except towards the end when she takes out those nukes sent down from Ronan. Even Peter Quill had issues controlling his powers and was CONSTANTLY being beaten by Ego until Yandu finally told him that he doesn\u2019t control his inner strength and power with his head\u2026 he uses his heart\u2026 and that Power Up that he gets after that, after struggling and losing the ENTIRE movie, is extraordinarily satisfying. You LOVE it when he gets that power up. It\u2019s like how in Wonder Woman she gets that power up after losing Steve and she goes ape shit\u2026 There\u2019s a huge emotional lead up and tipping point in those scenes, but Captain Marvel doesn\u2019t even do that. Instead she simply closes her eyes, and opens them and has complete control of her powers. It was ridiculous too because she hadn\u2019t trained with even a decent percentage of her powers at her disposal before! For six years she just trained with a small itty bitty bit of her powers and then suddenly she has full control over ALL of her power as soon as unlocking it? <b>That\u2019s like a Fireman being trained to put out fires with a garden hose for six years only then to be dragged out to use a full on fire-hose at full power that usually requires more than one person to control and expected to do just fine\u2026. Like, I\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s not how that should have worked. </b>After that point she\u2019s basically Superman and cannot be stopped. There\u2019s no fun to it anymore\u2026 it\u2019s just a boring overpowered character being overpowered simply because she\u2019s a woman\u2026 and this is only going to lead her up to being the hero that fans want to see lose. A LOT of people don\u2019t like Superman because he\u2019s a sort of Gary Stu in a sense and they ALWAYS love seeing him get his ass beat. By Batman, Shazam, Wonder Woman. Everyone enjoys seeing the most powerful man of all get taken down\u2026 Especially if they\u2019re on their high horse like Captain Marvel is with her arrogant ass. </p><p>Oh yeah, the last thing I wanna add\u2026 <b>They had to sex change Mar-Vell, the ORIGINAL Captain Marvel, because, of course, we can\u2019t have a feminist movie with a feminist character that we\u2019re trying to make into a feminist icon look up to a man after all. They had to have her looking up to a female Amelia Earhart sort of character instead of a Red Baron or Wright Brother sort of figure\u2026 That kinda peeved me as well. </b></p><p>So with ALL that being said, I simply think that she\u2019s toxic because her entire character is based off of feminism. Modern Feminism at that. (I draw a line between Classical Egalitarian Feminism that I actually agree with, and Modern Feminism.) The issue is that not everyone agrees with the agenda of Modern Feminism and since she\u2019s now the face of it, they\u2019re just going to see an agenda they hate rather than a character they dislike. They\u2019re going to see the Feminist Icon that they despise and won\u2019t pay attention to her as a character. It\u2019s going to cause a rift in the fan base, as it already has, and if she\u2019s going to be made the face of Marvel like they want her to I can bet you that people are going to be finished with Marvel. Real, TRUE, fans of the MCU, not blue haired normie feminists as I\u2019ve heard them described, are going to feel ostracised for not agreeing with Captain Marvels Politics and the fact that she\u2019s so powerful simply because of girl power. I feel that with the introduction of her as a Feminist Icon that any movie she\u2019s in is going to allude to that and buy into her Girl Power - Ex Machina stuff\u2026 Into the Mary Sue in her and it is going to cheapen every movie forward that she\u2019s in. I mean, people are already talking about not seeing End Game because she\u2019s in it and that they\u2019re afraid she\u2019s going to be the sole reason why the Avengers win\u2026 and frankly I\u2019m afraid that she may be the reason why the Avengers win too and that would bother me a LOT. Not because she\u2019s a woman, not because I hate women, but because she\u2019s a terribly written character with no personality and is beyond arrogant. Especially in the, \u2018Lets get Thanos.\u2019 End Game clip that Marvel Released\u2026 It bothers me a lot\u2026 </p><p>EDIT: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/6byj_uqzGh8\">https://youtu.be/6byj_uqzGh8</a> Here\u2019s more proof that she\u2019s a Mary Sue in the MCU films\u2026 They buffed the fuck out of her over the MCU Thor who has been nerfed to hell\u2026. \u201cCaptain Marvel is MUCH WEAKER than Thor.\u201d</p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h1>My Captain Marvel Review</h1><p>Before I do this, I want to clarify a few things. There are going to be both personal opinions on the character and simple objective observations from a different perspective that what most people are doing in defense of this character. &nbsp;I am not sexist. I am not racist. I am not misogynistic. I do not identify with the Alt-Right and consider myself a centrist. I believe that modern Feminism (Contrary to Classical Egalitarian-Feminism) is a toxin in society and now it has translated into the MCU through her movie.&nbsp;</p><p>I just wanted to put this out there first because any time I make any sort of evaluation of her movie or her as a character I get bombarded with hate, personal attacks, and people telling me why I hated the movie or something when they don&rsquo;t personally know me and aren&rsquo;t me. (You just hate strong female characters! Bitch, go look at my profile. I fucking LOVED Rescue, SCARLET FUCKING WITCH, and Nebula is literally one of my most favorite characters in the MCU&hellip; They were ALL badass in End Game)</p><p>So if you like her as a character and if you like her movie, please do not think that my observations of her or her movie are a personal attack against you. I&rsquo;ve had so many people take my viewpoint personally for some reason and it no longer is a debate as they close their minds off to anything I say and start becoming immediately dismissive. I mean no disrespect in any of my viewpoints. I just feel like I needed to put this out there because&hellip; again&hellip; more often then not I&rsquo;m dealing with some radical feminist that will foam at the mouth and protect her beloved character from any opposing viewpoint irrationally.</p><p>Lastly&hellip;</p><p>PLEASE. DO. NOT. REBLOG. WITH. A. REBUTTAL. AND. BLOCK. ME. LIKE. A. COWARD.&nbsp;</p><p>FUCKING. @. ME.&nbsp;</p><p>I&rsquo;M JUST LOOKING FOR SOMEONE WITH A BRAIN TO GIVE ME A GOOD COUNTER ARGUMENT TO THIS.</p><p><b>Okay, so, I personally believe that Captain Marvel and her movie were a toxic addition to the franchise.</b> This is going to be a little long, obviously, but I would appreciate it of you read through. Clearly you don&rsquo;t have to because it is a huge ass wall of text but taking in viewpoints that aren&rsquo;t constantly validating your own is HEALTHY&hellip; So please read?</p><p><b>Firstly, they retconned the Skrull</b>, that are one of the most recognizable villainous races in all of fiction like Klingons and Orcs, to be refugees of a war that they&rsquo;d lost. In the comics they have 100% control of the Andromeda Galaxy as one massive Empire and the Kree were definitely not in the position to eradicate the Skrulls. They could put up a good fight, but I feel that the Skrulls were too well fortified in Andromeda to really be defeated by the Kree. That&rsquo;s the first, shortest, issue I disliked about the movie. They nerfed the hell out of the Skrulls to being simple refugees&hellip; and innocent. I&rsquo;m sorry, but no&hellip; This is like going into the Star Trek Universe and retconning the Klingons to be some peace loving hippies. They were also some of the most human characters in the entire movie besides Nick and the Black Best friend. (I can&rsquo;t remember her name&hellip; she didn&rsquo;t stand out to me.) They were DEFINITELY more human than Carol Danvers herself. The moment when Talos goes to his family on Mar-Vells ship and hugs them was definitely the most human part of the entire film and it cemented my thoughts on the character. My favorite character in the entire movie was Talos. A lot more likable, interesting, and funny than Carol Danvers was&hellip; I wish the movie had entirely about him at this point because it would have been a better film by FAR. </p><p><b>Secondly, the themes.</b> There was a clear message that this movie was trying to sell long before it even hit theaters, and that was Modern Feminism. The Air Force advertisements featuring female pilots, the girl-power advertisements, and so on. The movie was clearly trying have a target audience of young women or young girls and there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that. However, I started to feel a bit off put by the movie when it showed literally ever male human character that wasn&rsquo;t Nick, Coulson, or the Skrull Leader, Talos, was a sexist prick. LITERALLY every single one of them were sexist. Even her Father. I understand in the comics her and her father never got along or something of that nature, but I personally feel that if they wanted to push the whole sexism narrative that they should have lead it with her father and kept it with her father. Instead they extended the narrative to every male in the entire movie and in her flashbacks. </p><p>I feel there needs to be a specific section on the flashbacks alone. Okay, so, in her flashbacks quite literally every single bad thing that happened to her was because of a man. </p><p>Carol was riding in that Go Kart and the boy told her she was going too fast. Of course in a feminist movie we can&rsquo;t have a girl listen to what a boy has to say, even if he may know more about what she was doing than she did, and so she goes and crashes horrifically. I thought it was a brutal crash. </p><p>A second later and her Dad appears looking down at his busted up and bleeding daughter, that I&rsquo;d be taking to a hospital in a heartbeat, saying that she didn&rsquo;t belong there. </p><p>Okay, that alone is unrealistic to me to begin with. There are a VERY few fathers out there that would have the first words coming out of their mouth being that she didn&rsquo;t belong to be out there. It would be about her health, asking if she was okay, and they would be looking her over as best as possible. However, I will agree with the Father&rsquo;s initial comment that she didn&rsquo;t belong out there on the track. Why? Well I wouldn&rsquo;t want my daughter, who was too stubborn to listen to a boy that was giving good advice when she was doing something dangerous, to do anything dangerous again. Damn right she doesn&rsquo;t belong in dangerous, male, situations and jobs if she&rsquo;s going to act that way. The girl is going to get herself killed. </p><p>Then there&rsquo;s the whole, &lsquo;You know what it&rsquo;s called a cockpit, right?&rsquo; scene and that alone, while not improbable, was unneeded at this point. We already had two male characters expressing their inherent, evil, sexism. Oh, but they went even further than that and got the motorcycle guy in there as well telling her to smile and everything. (Woulda been the first smile in that movie so far at that point for Brie.) While that does happen they&rsquo;re continuing to beat a dead horse&hellip; Then later on it shows her being bullied on a beach when she&rsquo;s REALLY little by BOYS he knock her down. </p><p>Then in Basic Training they&rsquo;re all yelling out to her that she&rsquo;s gonna die or and things of that nature are more or less unrealistic as well. My father was in the military and was going through basic around the same time that she was and he went into the same branch. The Air Force. When you go into the military they tell you that you are to be colorblind. That you are to be ONE force. ONE unit. You are a team and NOTHING should stand in the way of that. The means that racism, sexism, or any sort of predisposed idealism that puts on person down while raising another up is to be crushed and blown away like dust in the wind. It has no place in the Military as it reduces its effectiveness. So in that training scene where they&rsquo;re yelling at Carol that she&rsquo;s going to die and that she&rsquo;s going to fail is NOT a proper representation of what happens in basic training. Maybe the Drill Instructors to stress you out or drill it into you that what your doing is dangerous and the military itself is dangerous, but not by your fellow team members. If anything your fellow team members are supportive because there are group punishments for your weakest link in your unit&hellip; If they fail, you all fail. If one person is stupid, you ALL get punished for their stupidity. So for her fellow trainees to be putting her down like that makes next to no sense and it is CLEARLY intimating the issue of women in the workplace not being able to do what a man can do or women simply being put down in the workplace for simply being women. </p><p>So, I don&rsquo;t necessarily agree with the route in which they went about the topic of sexism. The execution and presentation were not done well in my opinion. While you may have felt it resonated with you, what about the boys and the men? </p><p>Marvel Movies have always been oriented towards everyone. They&rsquo;ve been family movies. Not one Marvel Movie has been solely and strictly for men. Why? Because movies with male leads don&rsquo;t focus on the fact that they are MALE leads&hellip; There&rsquo;s nothing special about a male lead or male actor in a film. They don&rsquo;t feel the need to point it out or make the male actor into a champion for men and masculinity. </p><p>So, again, what does this film tell you about men? It tells you what I&rsquo;ve described. That men are sexist oppressors that want nothing more than to see women fail, smile, and do what they say. That men think women can&rsquo;t do the same job that a man can and that women aren&rsquo;t as strong as men. That&rsquo;s a message that is being conveyed here&hellip; and that&rsquo;s the ONLY message you get on the subject. That&rsquo;s the bottom line. There&rsquo;s no, 'but not all men-&rsquo; in this film. There&rsquo;s no redemption act, representation (I know a lot of you love that word so here you go&hellip; You won&rsquo;t like it cause I&rsquo;m using it in a way you disagree with it.), or presentation of the fact that men will stand for women in face of true sexism. There isn&rsquo;t any sort of male role model to learn from in the film. Nick is there for comedic relief, Coulson is barely in the film, and the Skrull isn&rsquo;t even human. There&rsquo;s no outreach to TEACH boys and young men that sexism is bad. It simply states that men are sexist. That&rsquo;s literally it. This movie was for girls and girls alone, which is a failure in and of itself on the side of Marvel, and it is simply teaching them that men will do this. That boys will do this. There&rsquo;s nothing there to teach boys to not do that or any sort of redeeming quality for men in the film at all. Is this wrong?</p><p>So, yes, if you think it presented the female experience realistically, which I felt it did not in certain scenes, than I am not one to try and change your mind. I&rsquo;ve never been in a woman&rsquo;s shoes and I&rsquo;ve never experienced sexism from men like that. I&rsquo;ll let my opinions stand for themselves. </p><p>While I agree that sexism is truly a problem in society and still lingers, I simply feel that it wasn&rsquo;t presented well enough. That&rsquo;s my main issue with sexism in this film.</p><p>On a personal level I felt that if you&rsquo;re a guy going to see this movie that you should prepare to feel like an asshole. The entire film is intimating that men are oppressing women, that men see women as objects that need to smile more, that women aren&rsquo;t as strong as a guy or can&rsquo;t do what a guy can do. It puts men in a bad light and sort of validates the Modern Feminist talking points and agendas that all men are evil, shallow, vile creatures that want to oppress women because they think that they are objects and aren&rsquo;t as tough, strong, or brave as men. </p><p>(If Marvel had made a Movie about a Man that acted arrogant, cold, emotionless, and super super super strong and made all the female characters in his past trying to put him down, were annoying, were emotionally manipulative and controlling, were emotionally abusive, were using men for their wealth or income, and were lying cheaters with no sort of redemption character for women to prove things differently I think that this movie would have tanked.)</p><p><b>Thirdly, a shallow Carol Danvers.</b> With all that being said up above, I feel like that all that made her character VERY shallow. The ONLY reason she&rsquo;s a pilot, the ONLY reason she&rsquo;s &lsquo;strong independent woman&rsquo;, the ONLY reason why she&rsquo;s a hero is because she&rsquo;s a woman that&rsquo;s been put down by men her entire life. To prove that she can be a strong independent woman, and that men can&rsquo;t keep her down anymore. It&rsquo;s a consistent attitude of hers to challenge men regardless of who they are or to act arrogant towards them as when first seen by Nick Fury. Immediately upon seeing him she acts a bit sassy, or arrogant, because Nick isn&rsquo;t knowledgeable about the alien conflicts that exists or doesn&rsquo;t believe her about the shapeshifting Skrulls. This entire issue sort of cheapens the character as well because if you created the character with the sole purpose to be a conduit or avatar for feminism and feminist talking points&hellip; where do you go from there? All of her personality traits, all of her history, and everything that made Carol Danvers who she is about the oppressive nature of men. Once that is solved, which it is in her movie after she gains the full scale of her powers, where do you go from there? </p><p>For example in the Amazing Spider Man movies with Andrew Garfield his story was that his parents had died a long time ago and he knew nothing about them. After discovering some papers belonging to his father it becomes a story about self-discovery. To learn about his parents and what happened to them. To understand and connect with them in the only way he could which was through Dr. Conners. Later, since he is on this journey of discovery about his father and mother&rsquo;s demise, he forgets to walk Aunt May home and Uncle Ben is mad at him for not remembering to do this and that he needs to start being responsible. Peter gets frustrated because this relates to his own past and current journey of understanding. To his father. Why did his father die? Why was he sent to his Aunt and Uncle&rsquo;s house when he had a responsibility to Peter and to be a father? Peter leaves out of this anger and selfishness and Ben attempts to follow. Peter had made his way to a convenience store and was trying to buy some milk but is a few cents short and lets a thief rob the place due to the cashier being somewhat of an asshole about it. While on his search for Peter, Uncle Ben encounters the thief and tries to stop him and that gets him shot. Uncle Ben dies and Peter realizes that it&rsquo;s his fault. That he had the power and strength to do the right thing but simply stood there and did nothing. That is what begins his quest as a Superhero. If a good person has the power to do something to save someone&rsquo;s life, but doesn&rsquo;t, are they really a good person? Are they just as bad as the man that pulled the trigger by letting someone die? So that becomes who Peter is. Peter isn&rsquo;t a hero because he&rsquo;s a strong white kid who got bit by a weird spider. Peter isn&rsquo;t a strong hero because he&rsquo;s a man or because women or men were keeping him down. Peter is a strong hero because he learned the HARD way that if you have the power to stop someone from doing something that could cost an innocent person their life, and do nothing, you&rsquo;re just as bad as the guy that pulled that trigger&hellip; </p><p>Hell, Shazam&rsquo;s is, &lsquo;If you can&rsquo;t save your family, what kind of Hero are you?&rsquo; I&rsquo;m not sure if I got the wording perfect, but even the REAL Captain Marvel here stands for something that has deeper meaning and truth. Shazam is ALL about family and fighting for them&hellip; </p><p>That is a much deeper, much BETTER, character traits than the simple feminist argument that Brie Larson&rsquo;s Captain Marvel stands for. That she&rsquo;s a strong because she&rsquo;s a woman. That she&rsquo;s strong because she won&rsquo;t let men keep her down anymore. That she can do whatever a man can do and do it even better. I simply feel like that cheapens the character and is a very boring, shallow, and limited origin story because throughout a Hero&rsquo;s career they will be challenged on their morals and the reasoning behind what they do. &nbsp;(And GIRL POWER is already something that has been established in Cinema for well over 50 years&hellip;) Batman&rsquo;s is vengeance versus justice. That is a HUGE topic for the hero and he has been struggling with that issue for decades. An argument could be made towards Shazam that his reason for being a hero and doing good, to protect his family, isn&rsquo;t FOR his family or BECAUSE his family&hellip; it&rsquo;s because he&rsquo;s scared to be alone again. That could be a good inner struggle for Shazam. So what sort of personal beliefs are going to be challenged when it comes to Captain Marvel? What sort of personal dilemma or inner struggle can she possibly go through? Why is she a hero? Cause even if you extend her origin story away from her childhood and to the Kree Empire where she was being trained to be used as a weapon against the Skrull that goes back to the issue of oppression and ties in with the rest of her history. Carol has been oppressed by men, told what to do by men, and has been controlled and used by men (Yon-Rogg is the face of this issue, and once again he&rsquo;s a man.) for their personal gain and desires. </p><p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but it&rsquo;s just weak and shallow. There are no further storylines that you can have that sort of validate her reasoning of being a hero without making it some gigantic feminist issue. If the issue isn&rsquo;t about feminism then she&rsquo;s simply trying to do the right thing to do the right thing&hellip; and ANYONE can do that. It doesn&rsquo;t make her special. In fact, there&rsquo;s nothing really special or ultimately heroic about her. All she is a woman that achieved powers and saved a couple of refugees and declared war on a corrupt Empire. It&rsquo;s&hellip; weak. Steve Rogers fights for Freedom and fights against Tyranny and was forced to reevaluate America and Shield during Winter Soldier and Civil War. These CHALLENGED his very meaning of being a Hero and what he stood for&hellip; The Hulk and Bruce Banner fight because they&rsquo;re constantly being hunted to be exploited for their power, and not just by people who want to use him for evil, but also by people that want to his power for good&hellip; the bottom line is Bruce and Hulk fight to escape being used as a chess piece. They just want to be left alone. In this sense they aren&rsquo;t even a hero, and that makes it even better for them as a character because it makes their choices and issues interesting to say the least&hellip; Black Widow fights because she&rsquo;s trying to make up for the evils of her past. Tony fights because he wants to protect who he loves most and that he feels he has an obligation to Earth and to protect innocent people from being killed like the ones that were being killed by the weapons he designed to protect them in Iron Man 1. </p><p>I&rsquo;ll leave that there though. I think the last thing I want to talk about is the Mary Sue aspect of captain Marvel. Just so people don&rsquo;t immediately hate me for calling her a Mary Sue I&rsquo;m going to copy and paste the definition. </p><p><b>Mar&middot;y Sue</b></p><p><i>noun</i></p><p><i>noun</i>: Mary Sue; plural noun: Mary Sues</p><ol><li>(originally in fan fiction) a type of female character who is depicted as unrealistically lacking in flaws or weaknesses.</li></ol><p><i>&ldquo;she was not a &lsquo;strong woman&rsquo; so much as an insufferable Mary Sue&rdquo;</i></p><p>So Captain Marvel is a Superhero and Superheros, in order to make them appealing and relatable, are ALWAYS shown to have flaws, weaknesses, and things about them that make them more human to the target audience. That&rsquo;s what makes them lovable and likable. That you can relate to them and understand where they are coming from and sympathize with them. That you can watch them grow as a character and enjoy their Hero&rsquo;s Journey. In this movie Captain Marvel has no character growth. Carol Danvers is literally the same as she was in the beginning as she was in the end except she has all her powers and now she hates the Kree. Carol Danvers has no personality flaws whatsoever except, maybe, arrogance and trust issues, and those aren&rsquo;t exactly traits you want to share with her. They aren&rsquo;t healthy character flaws. Besides that she barely has a personality to begin with for there to be any sort of flaws. &lsquo;She&rsquo;s spent six years learning to control her emotions,&rsquo; I&rsquo;m sorry, but no. That argument is weak. Just because you learn how to CONTROL your emotions doesn&rsquo;t mean that you sacrifice your personality in the process. </p><p>So with that being said she has no sort of personality flaw about herself and it is shown in the movie that she has no physical or emotional weaknesses either. In the entire movie the only time she was beaten was because of a surprise attack by Talon. From then on out she has consistently kicked ass, NEVER lost a fight, and NEVER physically struggled against any enemy. Carol was super strong and could NOT be stopped. It sucked any sort of drama or any sort of tension out of the movie. You knew she was going to win and be the hero because at that point nothing could stop her. Carol is a badass woman that could not be stopped. Yay Girl Power! </p><p>The best opportunity for her to have been given a weakness and a struggle was when she unlocked her full potential and had access to ALL of her power. To make her struggle to control it for the entirety of the battle except towards the end when she takes out those nukes sent down from Ronan. Even Peter Quill had issues controlling his powers and was CONSTANTLY being beaten by Ego until Yandu finally told him that he doesn&rsquo;t control his inner strength and power with his head&hellip; he uses his heart&hellip; and that Power Up that he gets after that, after struggling and losing the ENTIRE movie, is extraordinarily satisfying. You LOVE it when he gets that power up. It&rsquo;s like how in Wonder Woman she gets that power up after losing Steve and she goes ape shit&hellip; There&rsquo;s a huge emotional lead up and tipping point in those scenes, but Captain Marvel doesn&rsquo;t even do that. Instead she simply closes her eyes, and opens them and has complete control of her powers. It was ridiculous too because she hadn&rsquo;t trained with even a decent percentage of her powers at her disposal before! For six years she just trained with a small itty bitty bit of her powers and then suddenly she has full control over ALL of her power as soon as unlocking it? <b>That&rsquo;s like a Fireman being trained to put out fires with a garden hose for six years only then to be dragged out to use a full on fire-hose at full power that usually requires more than one person to control and expected to do just fine&hellip;. Like, I&rsquo;m sorry, but that&rsquo;s not how that should have worked. </b>After that point she&rsquo;s basically Superman and cannot be stopped. There&rsquo;s no fun to it anymore&hellip; it&rsquo;s just a boring overpowered character being overpowered simply because she&rsquo;s a woman&hellip; and this is only going to lead her up to being the hero that fans want to see lose. A LOT of people don&rsquo;t like Superman because he&rsquo;s a sort of Gary Stu in a sense and they ALWAYS love seeing him get his ass beat. By Batman, Shazam, Wonder Woman. Everyone enjoys seeing the most powerful man of all get taken down&hellip; Especially if they&rsquo;re on their high horse like Captain Marvel is with her arrogant ass. </p><p>Oh yeah, the last thing I wanna add&hellip; <b>They had to sex change Mar-Vell, the ORIGINAL Captain Marvel, because, of course, we can&rsquo;t have a feminist movie with a feminist character that we&rsquo;re trying to make into a feminist icon look up to a man after all. They had to have her looking up to a female Amelia Earhart sort of character instead of a Red Baron or Wright Brother sort of figure&hellip; That kinda peeved me as well. </b></p><p>So with ALL that being said, I simply think that she&rsquo;s toxic because her entire character is based off of feminism. Modern Feminism at that. (I draw a line between Classical Egalitarian Feminism that I actually agree with, and Modern Feminism.) The issue is that not everyone agrees with the agenda of Modern Feminism and since she&rsquo;s now the face of it, they&rsquo;re just going to see an agenda they hate rather than a character they dislike. They&rsquo;re going to see the Feminist Icon that they despise and won&rsquo;t pay attention to her as a character. It&rsquo;s going to cause a rift in the fan base, as it already has, and if she&rsquo;s going to be made the face of Marvel like they want her to I can bet you that people are going to be finished with Marvel. Real, TRUE, fans of the MCU, not blue haired normie feminists as I&rsquo;ve heard them described, are going to feel ostracised for not agreeing with Captain Marvels Politics and the fact that she&rsquo;s so powerful simply because of girl power. I feel that with the introduction of her as a Feminist Icon that any movie she&rsquo;s in is going to allude to that and buy into her Girl Power - Ex Machina stuff&hellip; Into the Mary Sue in her and it is going to cheapen every movie forward that she&rsquo;s in. I mean, people are already talking about not seeing End Game because she&rsquo;s in it and that they&rsquo;re afraid she&rsquo;s going to be the sole reason why the Avengers win&hellip; and frankly I&rsquo;m afraid that she may be the reason why the Avengers win too and that would bother me a LOT. Not because she&rsquo;s a woman, not because I hate women, but because she&rsquo;s a terribly written character with no personality and is beyond arrogant. Especially in the, &lsquo;Lets get Thanos.&rsquo; End Game clip that Marvel Released&hellip; It bothers me a lot&hellip; </p><p>EDIT: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/6byj_uqzGh8\">https://youtu.be/6byj_uqzGh8</a> Here&rsquo;s more proof that she&rsquo;s a Mary Sue in the MCU films&hellip; They buffed the fuck out of her over the MCU Thor who has been nerfed to hell&hellip;. &ldquo;Captain Marvel is MUCH WEAKER than Thor.&rdquo;</p></p>",
