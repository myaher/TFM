But this \nman had been crookbacked and hideous, and he looked as though he might \nhave lice. If this was what the Night\u2019s Watch was truly like, <b>she felt \nsorry for her bastard half brother, Jon. \n\n</b></small><br/></p></blockquote><blockquote><p> <small>She sang for mercy, for the living and the dead alike, for Bran and Rickon and Robb, for her sister Arya and <b>her bastard brother Jon Snow, away off on the Wall. \n\n</b></small></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\n<small>Sansa could never understand how two sisters, born only two years apart,\n could be so different. <b>It would have been easier if Arya had been a \nbastard, like their half brother Jon</b>. She even looked like\n Jon, with the long face and brown hair of the Starks, and nothing of \ntheir lady mother in her face or her coloring. And Jon\u2019s mother had been\n common, or so people whispered. Once, when she was littler, Sansa had \neven asked Mother if perhaps there hadn\u2019t been some mistake. Perhaps the\n grumkins had stolen her real sister. But Mother had only laughed and \nsaid no, Arya was her daughter and Sansa\u2019s trueborn sister, blood of \ntheir blood.

It implies that there is a difference in proximity between a trueborn sibling and a bastard sibling. Sansa goes on to think that it would be easier if Arya was a bastrad like Jon because of that exact sentiment since it is expected for there to be a distance between trueborn and bastard siblings.<br/></p><p>\nAlso, Sansa does not know that Jon is her cousin so that has no bearing on how she refers to him, hence the half <i>brother</i> part. That does not mean that I think that Sansa hates Jon or any such nonsense, only that she sees him in a different way from how she sees the rest of her siblings, specifically because he is a bastard.<br/></p><p>In short, please do reread the books before you go off in people\u2019s inbox about their so-called lies. Or, if you\u2019re a show-only watcher, perhaps rewatch the scene where Sansa says that she was horrible to Jon as a child and asks him to forgive her.<br/></p>",
