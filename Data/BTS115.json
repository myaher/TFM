You had not spoken to one another since you had let each other go, silence on either side, both hoping that the other would take the first step and reach out, but neither of you had. Gi was nearing nine months old, she was standing up, crawling, even trying to walk unaided, she made you proud every day. It had been awful for the both of you, it felt as though you were walking around with a limb missing. You missed his voice, his caring and loving nature and the way he was always looking out for you. He missed your laugh and the way your face lit up the minute you talked about Gi, the way that you updated him on her progress and how fast she was growing. The silence was killing you both, destroying your souls. </p><p>Tae was crouched to the ground, unpacking his clothes from various suitcases, sorting through the piles of clothes, deciding what needed to be washed first. He stood up from his crouched position, stretching his cramped body. Rubbing his chest, a photograph caught the corner of his eye, it was the photo of you both on your 21<sup>st</sup> birthday. One arm was around his neck pulling him into your side, the other hand place onto his chest, laughing joyfully into him. Both his arms were wrapped around your body, forehead pressed against your temple, him too laughing. Glancing down at his watch, the time was 2pm, would you be home? He knew you hadn\u2019t spoken, it killed him not knowing what the pair of you were getting up to or how the both of you were doing. Deciding to be the bigger person, he picked up his coat, heading out of his bedroom towards the front door. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d shouted Jimin from the sofa, peering over to his friend by the door who was curious to know where he was heading in such a rush. \u201cJust for a walk\u201d Taehyung lied, not wanting him to know what he was up to, he didn\u2019t want to get his hopes up. </p><p>He was right to not get his hopes up. Arriving at your familiar front door, he knocked onto the wood, signalling his presence. He waited a few moments, biting his gum nervously, hoping that you would answer his call and welcome him with open arms, however, this was not the case. A man that Tae did not recognise answered the door, who was now looking at him with confusion. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d asked the man, who began to look him up and down, trying to suss where he knew him from. \u201cOh, I was just wondering if y/n is home? This was her apartment last time I checked\u201d he admitted, still biting his gum. \u201cOh y/n, yeah she doesn\u2019t live here anymore, she moved out about three months ago, sorry\u201d apologised the man, who was beginning to close the door. Taehyung gave him a kind smile, turning back towards the lifts, his soul felt as though it had been sucked out of him. He leant against the mirror of the lift, rubbing his forehead out of frustration, why had he let you slip through his fingers so easily? It was then that he remembered what you had said that night\u2026 \u201c<i>I think it\u2019ll be best for me to move in with my parents for a while</i>\u201d. Your parents, that\u2019s where you were. He hadn\u2019t seen them since the night of your 21<sup>st </sup>birthday, why was that night always haunting the both of you? </p><p>Suddenly regretting not bringing his car, he managed to grab a taxi, telling the driver the address of your parents\u2019 home. The journey was half an hour, he had 30 minutes to think of what he\u2019d say to you, 30 minutes to keep his tears at bay. The taxi arrived at the destination, he took a deep breath before leaving the car, not knowing what to do next. He walked up to the door, coughing into his fist before he knocked, hoping that you weren\u2019t the one to answer. Moments later, your mother opened the door, she hadn\u2019t changed, you were exactly like her, such beautiful women. \u201cTaehyung? Is that you?\u201d said your mother, cocking her head to the side. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you again\u201d he replied, trying to reduce his chin from wobbling. \u201cCome on in love, y/n is just showering\u201d she stated, ushering him into the house as though she had saw him the previous. He began to take off his coat, to which your mother immediately took from his grasp, hanging it onto the coat hook in the hallway. \u201cCome into the kitchen\u201d she suggested, hoping that he would follow, \u201cTell me what you\u2019ve been up to\u201d. You hadn\u2019t told your mum about how things had ended with Taehyung, she would only scold you, she had always hinted how the two of you were perfect for one another. Tae loved the way your mother treat him, it was always with such respect and kindness. </p><p>He was leant against the kitchen worktop, now holding a mug of tea beginning to take a sip, he was talking to your mother about their busy schedule when he was interrupted by your presence. \u201cGi is finally napping-\u201d you paused, looking over at your friend, \u201cTae\u201d, the ever so familiar nickname making his heart sink. \u201cHi sweetheart\u201d he mumbled, biting his gum. You didn\u2019t know how to react, didn\u2019t know what to say or even think. \u201cMum, can you give us a minute please?\u201d you asked, hoping she would take the hint, to which she did. She turned her pans on a low heat, beginning to head out of the kitchen to find your father. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d you questioned him, walking over to him slowly. \u201cI could say the same for you\u201d he replied, crossing his foot over the other. \u201cDon\u2019t do this Tae, not now\u201d you hissed, standing in front of him, \u201cHow dare you just turn up here, thinking that you can just arrive home after five months, acting as though everything is okay\u201d. He shook his head, tongue prodding the inside of his mouth with frustration. \u201cOh yes, how dare I y/n, I think you\u2019ve forgotten you were the one that ended things before they had even started\u201d he snapped back, as though he wanted you to know that he didn\u2019t want to let you go. \u201cYeah well, I guess we\u2019re even aren\u2019t we. You ended it first and I\u2019ll end it a second\u201d you answered, turning your head away from him. \u201cThere was nothing to end the first time\u201d he whispered, not wanting your parents to hear you argue. \u201cYou really believe that?\u201d you interrogated, your head close to his, \u201cThat night meant nothing to you, is that what you\u2019re saying?\u201d, you could feel him breathing against your face. He shook his head once more, nudging your nose with his own, before leading his head towards your jaw, his lips brushing the rim of your ear. \u201cYou know that night meant everything to me\u201d he whispered, his breath tickling your ear, the words making your breath shake. He nudged you once more, his hands cupping either side of your face, lips pressing delicately to your own, however, was interrupted by your mother coming into the kitchen. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t change anything\u201d you mumbled, walking away from his embrace. \u201cTaehyung, are you staying for dinner?\u201d your mother asked as she was taking the pans off the hobs, before you could answer for him he interjected. \u201cYes, that\u2019d be lovely thank you\u201d he replied, glaring over at you with a smirk across his face. </p><p>You had all finished dinner, casually talking sat around the dining room table, your parents catching up with Taehyung, praising him for his achievements. Mid conversation you heard Gi crying from upstairs, alerting you that she was awake from her nap. \u201cI won\u2019t be long, sorry\u201d you said as you stood up from your chair, heading upstairs. Opening the door, you could see your frustrated daughter in her crib, kicking her legs frantically. \u201cHey, what\u2019s wrong gorgeous girl?\u201d you whispered as you picked her out of the cot, kissing her head softly. She cuddled immediately into your neck, finding comfort in your scent. You swayed from side to side, rubbing her back soothingly, her cries had stopped now that she was safe in your arms. You heard a subtle knock to the bedroom door, turning towards it you could see Tae stood against the door frame, hands tucked into his pockets. \u201cShe\u2019s beautiful\u201d he mumbled, looking down at his feet, heart breaking into two, \u201cShe\u2019s so big now\u201d. You had to swallow the lump forming in your throat, you knew how much she meant to him. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go and see Tae, hmm?\u201d you suggested to your daughter, walking over to the door frame. He was shocked when her arms reached towards him, as though she could remember him. Taking her from your grasp he wrapped his arms around her tiny frame, placing a kiss to her head, a thankful smile spreading across his face. \u201cHi baby\u201d he whispered, rubbing his cheek against her head, \u201cI\u2019ve missed you\u201d. You watched him hold her lovingly for a few moments, the feelings rushing back to you, the memories replaying in your head. You shook them away, knowing all too well that it wasn\u2019t a good idea to be thinking this way, you knew it would never work, he never had time for the both of you. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go and see grandma and grandad?\u201d you suggested, walking out of the bedroom towards the stairs, hoping Tae and your daughter would follow. </p><p>The night was relaxed, Gi didn\u2019t leave Taehyung\u2019s side all night. She was constantly crawling over to him, passing him her favourite toys, laughing at every funny face he pulled. You were sat next to him, your head naturally resting against his shoulder out of habit, his arm draped around your shoulders. He bounced Gi up and down on his knees, the motion making her chuckle, her laugh echoing throughout the room. Your mother observed the three of you in awe, noticing how effortlessly you all interacted with one another, noticing how perfect you fit together. \u201cWe\u2019ll leave you kids in peace, we\u2019re going to head to bed, I\u2019ll make breakfast for us all in the morning, sleep well\u201d your mother informed, kissing yours and Gi\u2019s heads. She cupped Tae\u2019s cheek with her hand, smiling endearingly at him, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have you home Kim Taehyung\u201d, the comment making your heart sink. Tae didn\u2019t know what to do but smile as a response, scared that if he opened his mouth he\u2019d begin to cry. </p><p>It was an hour later and Gi had fallen asleep on Tae\u2019s chest, her hand randomly clutching his ear. \u201cI\u2019ll get her up to bed\u201d you announced, standing up from the sofa, \u201cThink I\u2019ll head to bed myself\u201d. Tae nodded, knowing how tired you must be, trying to earn a living and look after your daughter. \u201cI\u2019ll just sleep on the sofa\u201d he stated, rubbing his thighs. \u201cYou can share my bed it\u2019s fine\u201d you told him as you exited the living room. He watched you gently put Gi down in her crib, watching you both adoringly. You tiptoed away from the sleeping child, closing the door to her room slightly, leaving it ajar so you could hear her during the night. You both wandered to your room, suddenly feeling like teenagers once more. The last time he was in your old bedroom was the night of your 21<sup>st</sup> birthday, a night that he\u2019d never forget. He began to take off his clothes, both of you stood in the darkness. You held the hem of your t-shirt in your hands, ready to take it off. \u201cI\u2019ll give you some privacy\u201d Taehyung stated, heading towards the bedroom door. \u201cPlease Taehyung, it\u2019s not something you haven\u2019t seen before\u201d. He nodded to himself, still stood by the door. Lights from the street lamps outside were producing a glow into the room, creating a silhouette of your body. You slipped the top over your head, your frame somehow looking smaller than usual. Your eyes caught Tae\u2019s, both looking at each other with lust. \u201cY/N\u201d he whispered, his breath shaking, now walking towards you. His hands trailed around your waist slowly, his fingertips dancing delicately over your skin, a single finger tracing the outline of your spine, his movements making your head fall back slightly. Bending his head towards you, his nose nudged your ear, pressing a kiss underneath it. \u201cI know we can\u2019t be together, but please let me be in your life, her life, I need you both\u201d he admitted, kissing your neck tenderly. \u201cWe need you too\u201d you replied, your hand clutching around the back of his neck. He nudged your nose, lips brushing yours slightly as he brought your body closer to his, feeling each other\u2019s flesh against one another. \u201cHave me one last time, just for tonight\u201d you suggested, your fingertips trailing down his chest and stomach. He didn\u2019t answer you, instead he kissed you, his tongue parting your lips, both of you moaning into each other\u2019s mouths, it was obvious how much you had missed each other, it was obvious how much you still loved one another, the thoughts pushed into the corner of the room, scared to admit it. </p><p>The sex between you both was slow and intimate, as though you were savouring each touch, knowing that it would be the last time. His forearms were either side of your head, his mouth open against yours, both panting into each other\u2019s mouths. One of your hands pulled the hair at the back of his head, the action making him moan into your mouth as he pressed a kiss to your lips. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you\u201d he moaned, his head nuzzling into your neck, trying to mute his moans against your skin, not wanting to wake the others, \u201cI\u2019ve missed you too\u201d you groaned back, your other hand gripping to his bum cheek. You could feel his thrusts becoming sloppy, indicating that he was close. You began to thrust your own hips upwards, your hips bones meeting his skin with every plunge. \u201cKeep doing that\u201d he moaned, nudging your nose with his before kissing you lovingly, his tongue caressing yours. One of his arms moved from the side of your head, hooking underneath your thigh, creating a deeper thrust, the feeling making you both groan out in pleasure. \u201cThere\u201d you moaned, squeezing his bicep, you could see the concentration on his face, he wanted you to feel good. \u201cTae\u201d you whined, your head going back into the pillow, he took this moment to pepper your neck with kisses, \u201cCum for me sweetheart\u201d he whispered in your ear, taking the lobe between your teeth. It was as though his words had spurred your climax, you took his chin with your finger, pressing a kiss to his lips, \u201cCum with me\u201d you gasped against his mouth. There you both were, climaxing in unison, both of moaning into one another\u2019s mouths. He laid in-between your legs for a few moments, still inside of you, looking down at your endearingly. You brushed his sweat ridden hair out of his face, your thumb stroking his cheek. He leant down, pressing a soft kiss against your lips before removing himself and heading towards the bathroom to clean himself up. </p><p>He returned to the bedroom, slipping back under the covers, your back now facing his direction, his foot discreetly brushing your own once he was immersed into the covers. \u201cTae?\u201d you spoke, glancing over your shoulder. \u201cHmm?\u201d he responded, his foot still stroking yours soothingly. \u201cEven though it\u2019s not going to work between us, you won\u2019t lose us, I promise\u201d you told him, turning your head back to its original position, rubbing your cheek against the pillow in attempts to get comfortable. Silence took over the room for a moment, the sound of each other breathing was all that could be heard. The covers began to rustle, suddenly feeling Tae\u2019s arm wrap around your waist, pulling your back into his chest. Your hand clasped around his hand that was pressed against your stomach, his thumb brushing the skin below your belly button comfortingly. The silence was broken by your daughter crying in the next room. You went to lift yourself out of the covers when the hand that was pressed to your stomach held you back down, realising that Tae wasn\u2019t letting you leave the bed. \u201cI\u2019ll go, get some rest\u201d he assured, giving your stomach a slight squeeze before leaving you alone in the sheets. He put his boxers and a t-shirt on before leaving the bedroom, heading towards your daughter\u2019s bedroom. \u201cOh, sweetheart what\u2019s wrong?\u201d was what you heard him say, his words bringing a smile to your face, but it was his next sentence that made you feel the most secure and content for the first time in many months.</p><p> \u201cIt\u2019s okay baby, Tae\u2019s got you, I\u2019m not going anywhere I promise\u201d. </p><figure data-orig-width=\"268\" data-orig-height=\"338\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"sin-taehyung:MyKOonkp6-xbTMWv8G3iYQ:ZKv_cb2fr3HQA\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/576ff7d51696e4c9e9ccfaa758fc3ccf/tumblr_plum053QXu1wmc7sfo1_400.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"268\" data-orig-height=\"338\"/></figure>",

You had not spoken to one another since you had let each other go, silence on either side, both hoping that the other would take the first step and reach out, but neither of you had. Gi was nearing nine months old, she was standing up, crawling, even trying to walk unaided, she made you proud every day. It had been awful for the both of you, it felt as though you were walking around with a limb missing. You missed his voice, his caring and loving nature and the way he was always looking out for you. He missed your laugh and the way your face lit up the minute you talked about Gi, the way that you updated him on her progress and how fast she was growing. The silence was killing you both, destroying your souls. </p><p>Tae was crouched to the ground, unpacking his clothes from various suitcases, sorting through the piles of clothes, deciding what needed to be washed first. He stood up from his crouched position, stretching his cramped body. Rubbing his chest, a photograph caught the corner of his eye, it was the photo of you both on your 21<sup>st</sup> birthday. One arm was around his neck pulling him into your side, the other hand place onto his chest, laughing joyfully into him. Both his arms were wrapped around your body, forehead pressed against your temple, him too laughing. Glancing down at his watch, the time was 2pm, would you be home? He knew you hadn\u2019t spoken, it killed him not knowing what the pair of you were getting up to or how the both of you were doing. Deciding to be the bigger person, he picked up his coat, heading out of his bedroom towards the front door. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d shouted Jimin from the sofa, peering over to his friend by the door who was curious to know where he was heading in such a rush. \u201cJust for a walk\u201d Taehyung lied, not wanting him to know what he was up to, he didn\u2019t want to get his hopes up. </p><p>He was right to not get his hopes up. Arriving at your familiar front door, he knocked onto the wood, signalling his presence. He waited a few moments, biting his gum nervously, hoping that you would answer his call and welcome him with open arms, however, this was not the case. A man that Tae did not recognise answered the door, who was now looking at him with confusion. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d asked the man, who began to look him up and down, trying to suss where he knew him from. \u201cOh, I was just wondering if y/n is home? This was her apartment last time I checked\u201d he admitted, still biting his gum. \u201cOh y/n, yeah she doesn\u2019t live here anymore, she moved out about three months ago, sorry\u201d apologised the man, who was beginning to close the door. Taehyung gave him a kind smile, turning back towards the lifts, his soul felt as though it had been sucked out of him. He leant against the mirror of the lift, rubbing his forehead out of frustration, why had he let you slip through his fingers so easily? It was then that he remembered what you had said that night\u2026 \u201c<i>I think it\u2019ll be best for me to move in with my parents for a while</i>\u201d. Your parents, that\u2019s where you were. He hadn\u2019t seen them since the night of your 21<sup>st </sup>birthday, why was that night always haunting the both of you? </p><p>Suddenly regretting not bringing his car, he managed to grab a taxi, telling the driver the address of your parents\u2019 home. The journey was half an hour, he had 30 minutes to think of what he\u2019d say to you, 30 minutes to keep his tears at bay. The taxi arrived at the destination, he took a deep breath before leaving the car, not knowing what to do next. He walked up to the door, coughing into his fist before he knocked, hoping that you weren\u2019t the one to answer. Moments later, your mother opened the door, she hadn\u2019t changed, you were exactly like her, such beautiful women. \u201cTaehyung? Is that you?\u201d said your mother, cocking her head to the side. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you again\u201d he replied, trying to reduce his chin from wobbling. \u201cCome on in love, y/n is just showering\u201d she stated, ushering him into the house as though she had saw him the previous. He began to take off his coat, to which your mother immediately took from his grasp, hanging it onto the coat hook in the hallway. \u201cCome into the kitchen\u201d she suggested, hoping that he would follow, \u201cTell me what you\u2019ve been up to\u201d. You hadn\u2019t told your mum about how things had ended with Taehyung, she would only scold you, she had always hinted how the two of you were perfect for one another. Tae loved the way your mother treat him, it was always with such respect and kindness. </p><p>He was leant against the kitchen worktop, now holding a mug of tea beginning to take a sip, he was talking to your mother about their busy schedule when he was interrupted by your presence. \u201cGi is finally napping-\u201d you paused, looking over at your friend, \u201cTae\u201d, the ever so familiar nickname making his heart sink. \u201cHi sweetheart\u201d he mumbled, biting his gum. You didn\u2019t know how to react, didn\u2019t know what to say or even think. \u201cMum, can you give us a minute please?\u201d you asked, hoping she would take the hint, to which she did. She turned her pans on a low heat, beginning to head out of the kitchen to find your father. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d you questioned him, walking over to him slowly. \u201cI could say the same for you\u201d he replied, crossing his foot over the other. \u201cDon\u2019t do this Tae, not now\u201d you hissed, standing in front of him, \u201cHow dare you just turn up here, thinking that you can just arrive home after five months, acting as though everything is okay\u201d. He shook his head, tongue prodding the inside of his mouth with frustration. \u201cOh yes, how dare I y/n, I think you\u2019ve forgotten you were the one that ended things before they had even started\u201d he snapped back, as though he wanted you to know that he didn\u2019t want to let you go. \u201cYeah well, I guess we\u2019re even aren\u2019t we. You ended it first and I\u2019ll end it a second\u201d you answered, turning your head away from him. \u201cThere was nothing to end the first time\u201d he whispered, not wanting your parents to hear you argue. \u201cYou really believe that?\u201d you interrogated, your head close to his, \u201cThat night meant nothing to you, is that what you\u2019re saying?\u201d, you could feel him breathing against your face. He shook his head once more, nudging your nose with his own, before leading his head towards your jaw, his lips brushing the rim of your ear. \u201cYou know that night meant everything to me\u201d he whispered, his breath tickling your ear, the words making your breath shake. He nudged you once more, his hands cupping either side of your face, lips pressing delicately to your own, however, was interrupted by your mother coming into the kitchen. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t change anything\u201d you mumbled, walking away from his embrace. \u201cTaehyung, are you staying for dinner?\u201d your mother asked as she was taking the pans off the hobs, before you could answer for him he interjected. \u201cYes, that\u2019d be lovely thank you\u201d he replied, glaring over at you with a smirk across his face. </p><p>You had all finished dinner, casually talking sat around the dining room table, your parents catching up with Taehyung, praising him for his achievements. Mid conversation you heard Gi crying from upstairs, alerting you that she was awake from her nap. \u201cI won\u2019t be long, sorry\u201d you said as you stood up from your chair, heading upstairs. Opening the door, you could see your frustrated daughter in her crib, kicking her legs frantically. \u201cHey, what\u2019s wrong gorgeous girl?\u201d you whispered as you picked her out of the cot, kissing her head softly. She cuddled immediately into your neck, finding comfort in your scent. You swayed from side to side, rubbing her back soothingly, her cries had stopped now that she was safe in your arms. You heard a subtle knock to the bedroom door, turning towards it you could see Tae stood against the door frame, hands tucked into his pockets. \u201cShe\u2019s beautiful\u201d he mumbled, looking down at his feet, heart breaking into two, \u201cShe\u2019s so big now\u201d. You had to swallow the lump forming in your throat, you knew how much she meant to him. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go and see Tae, hmm?\u201d you suggested to your daughter, walking over to the door frame. He was shocked when her arms reached towards him, as though she could remember him. Taking her from your grasp he wrapped his arms around her tiny frame, placing a kiss to her head, a thankful smile spreading across his face. \u201cHi baby\u201d he whispered, rubbing his cheek against her head, \u201cI\u2019ve missed you\u201d. You watched him hold her lovingly for a few moments, the feelings rushing back to you, the memories replaying in your head. You shook them away, knowing all too well that it wasn\u2019t a good idea to be thinking this way, you knew it would never work, he never had time for the both of you. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go and see grandma and grandad?\u201d you suggested, walking out of the bedroom towards the stairs, hoping Tae and your daughter would follow. </p><p>The night was relaxed, Gi didn\u2019t leave Taehyung\u2019s side all night.

She cupped Tae\u2019s cheek with her hand, smiling endearingly at him, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have you home Kim Taehyung\u201d, the comment making your heart sink. Tae didn\u2019t know what to do but smile as a response, scared that if he opened his mouth he\u2019d begin to cry. </p><p>It was an hour later and Gi had fallen asleep on Tae\u2019s chest, her hand randomly clutching his ear. \u201cI\u2019ll get her up to bed\u201d you announced, standing up from the sofa, \u201cThink I\u2019ll head to bed myself\u201d.

You had not spoken to one another since you had let each other go, silence on either side, both hoping that the other would take the first step and reach out, but neither of you had. Gi was nearing nine months old, she was standing up, crawling, even trying to walk unaided, she made you proud every day. It had been awful for the both of you, it felt as though you were walking around with a limb missing. You missed his voice, his caring and loving nature and the way he was always looking out for you. He missed your laugh and the way your face lit up the minute you talked about Gi, the way that you updated him on her progress and how fast she was growing. The silence was killing you both, destroying your souls. </p><p>Tae was crouched to the ground, unpacking his clothes from various suitcases, sorting through the piles of clothes, deciding what needed to be washed first. He stood up from his crouched position, stretching his cramped body. Rubbing his chest, a photograph caught the corner of his eye, it was the photo of you both on your 21<sup>st</sup> birthday. One arm was around his neck pulling him into your side, the other hand place onto his chest, laughing joyfully into him. Both his arms were wrapped around your body, forehead pressed against your temple, him too laughing. Glancing down at his watch, the time was 2pm, would you be home? He knew you hadn\u2019t spoken, it killed him not knowing what the pair of you were getting up to or how the both of you were doing. Deciding to be the bigger person, he picked up his coat, heading out of his bedroom towards the front door. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d shouted Jimin from the sofa, peering over to his friend by the door who was curious to know where he was heading in such a rush. \u201cJust for a walk\u201d Taehyung lied, not wanting him to know what he was up to, he didn\u2019t want to get his hopes up. </p><p>He was right to not get his hopes up. Arriving at your familiar front door, he knocked onto the wood, signalling his presence. He waited a few moments, biting his gum nervously, hoping that you would answer his call and welcome him with open arms, however, this was not the case. A man that Tae did not recognise answered the door, who was now looking at him with confusion. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d asked the man, who began to look him up and down, trying to suss where he knew him from. \u201cOh, I was just wondering if y/n is home? This was her apartment last time I checked\u201d he admitted, still biting his gum. \u201cOh y/n, yeah she doesn\u2019t live here anymore, she moved out about three months ago, sorry\u201d apologised the man, who was beginning to close the door. Taehyung gave him a kind smile, turning back towards the lifts, his soul felt as though it had been sucked out of him. He leant against the mirror of the lift, rubbing his forehead out of frustration, why had he let you slip through his fingers so easily? It was then that he remembered what you had said that night\u2026 \u201c<i>I think it\u2019ll be best for me to move in with my parents for a while</i>\u201d. Your parents, that\u2019s where you were. He hadn\u2019t seen them since the night of your 21<sup>st </sup>birthday, why was that night always haunting the both of you? </p><p>Suddenly regretting not bringing his car, he managed to grab a taxi, telling the driver the address of your parents\u2019 home. The journey was half an hour, he had 30 minutes to think of what he\u2019d say to you, 30 minutes to keep his tears at bay. The taxi arrived at the destination, he took a deep breath before leaving the car, not knowing what to do next. He walked up to the door, coughing into his fist before he knocked, hoping that you weren\u2019t the one to answer. Moments later, your mother opened the door, she hadn\u2019t changed, you were exactly like her, such beautiful women. \u201cTaehyung? Is that you?\u201d said your mother, cocking her head to the side. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you again\u201d he replied, trying to reduce his chin from wobbling. \u201cCome on in love, y/n is just showering\u201d she stated, ushering him into the house as though she had saw him the previous. He began to take off his coat, to which your mother immediately took from his grasp, hanging it onto the coat hook in the hallway. \u201cCome into the kitchen\u201d she suggested, hoping that he would follow, \u201cTell me what you\u2019ve been up to\u201d. You hadn\u2019t told your mum about how things had ended with Taehyung, she would only scold you, she had always hinted how the two of you were perfect for one another. Tae loved the way your mother treat him, it was always with such respect and kindness. </p><p>He was leant against the kitchen worktop, now holding a mug of tea beginning to take a sip, he was talking to your mother about their busy schedule when he was interrupted by your presence. \u201cGi is finally napping-\u201d you paused, looking over at your friend, \u201cTae\u201d, the ever so familiar nickname making his heart sink. \u201cHi sweetheart\u201d he mumbled, biting his gum. You didn\u2019t know how to react, didn\u2019t know what to say or even think. \u201cMum, can you give us a minute please?\u201d you asked, hoping she would take the hint, to which she did. She turned her pans on a low heat, beginning to head out of the kitchen to find your father. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d you questioned him, walking over to him slowly. \u201cI could say the same for you\u201d he replied, crossing his foot over the other. \u201cDon\u2019t do this Tae, not now\u201d you hissed, standing in front of him, \u201cHow dare you just turn up here, thinking that you can just arrive home after five months, acting as though everything is okay\u201d. He shook his head, tongue prodding the inside of his mouth with frustration. \u201cOh yes, how dare I y/n, I think you\u2019ve forgotten you were the one that ended things before they had even started\u201d he snapped back, as though he wanted you to know that he didn\u2019t want to let you go. \u201cYeah well, I guess we\u2019re even aren\u2019t we. You ended it first and I\u2019ll end it a second\u201d you answered, turning your head away from him. \u201cThere was nothing to end the first time\u201d he whispered, not wanting your parents to hear you argue. \u201cYou really believe that?\u201d you interrogated, your head close to his, \u201cThat night meant nothing to you, is that what you\u2019re saying?\u201d, you could feel him breathing against your face. He shook his head once more, nudging your nose with his own, before leading his head towards your jaw, his lips brushing the rim of your ear. \u201cYou know that night meant everything to me\u201d he whispered, his breath tickling your ear, the words making your breath shake. He nudged you once more, his hands cupping either side of your face, lips pressing delicately to your own, however, was interrupted by your mother coming into the kitchen. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t change anything\u201d you mumbled, walking away from his embrace. \u201cTaehyung, are you staying for dinner?\u201d your mother asked as she was taking the pans off the hobs, before you could answer for him he interjected. \u201cYes, that\u2019d be lovely thank you\u201d he replied, glaring over at you with a smirk across his face. </p><p>You had all finished dinner, casually talking sat around the dining room table, your parents catching up with Taehyung, praising him for his achievements. Mid conversation you heard Gi crying from upstairs, alerting you that she was awake from her nap. \u201cI won\u2019t be long, sorry\u201d you said as you stood up from your chair, heading upstairs. Opening the door, you could see your frustrated daughter in her crib, kicking her legs frantically. \u201cHey, what\u2019s wrong gorgeous girl?\u201d you whispered as you picked her out of the cot, kissing her head softly. She cuddled immediately into your neck, finding comfort in your scent. You swayed from side to side, rubbing her back soothingly, her cries had stopped now that she was safe in your arms. You heard a subtle knock to the bedroom door, turning towards it you could see Tae stood against the door frame, hands tucked into his pockets. \u201cShe\u2019s beautiful\u201d he mumbled, looking down at his feet, heart breaking into two, \u201cShe\u2019s so big now\u201d. You had to swallow the lump forming in your throat, you knew how much she meant to him. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go and see Tae, hmm?\u201d you suggested to your daughter, walking over to the door frame. He was shocked when her arms reached towards him, as though she could remember him. Taking her from your grasp he wrapped his arms around her tiny frame, placing a kiss to her head, a thankful smile spreading across his face. \u201cHi baby\u201d he whispered, rubbing his cheek against her head, \u201cI\u2019ve missed you\u201d. You watched him hold her lovingly for a few moments, the feelings rushing back to you, the memories replaying in your head. You shook them away, knowing all too well that it wasn\u2019t a good idea to be thinking this way, you knew it would never work, he never had time for the both of you. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go and see grandma and grandad?\u201d you suggested, walking out of the bedroom towards the stairs, hoping Tae and your daughter would follow. </p><p>The night was relaxed, Gi didn\u2019t leave Taehyung\u2019s side all night. She was constantly crawling over to him, passing him her favourite toys, laughing at every funny face he pulled. You were sat next to him, your head naturally resting against his shoulder out of habit, his arm draped around your shoulders. He bounced Gi up and down on his knees, the motion making her chuckle, her laugh echoing throughout the room. Your mother observed the three of you in awe, noticing how effortlessly you all interacted with one another, noticing how perfect you fit together. \u201cWe\u2019ll leave you kids in peace, we\u2019re going to head to bed, I\u2019ll make breakfast for us all in the morning, sleep well\u201d your mother informed, kissing yours and Gi\u2019s heads. She cupped Tae\u2019s cheek with her hand, smiling endearingly at him, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have you home Kim Taehyung\u201d, the comment making your heart sink. Tae didn\u2019t know what to do but smile as a response, scared that if he opened his mouth he\u2019d begin to cry. </p><p>It was an hour later and Gi had fallen asleep on Tae\u2019s chest, her hand randomly clutching his ear. \u201cI\u2019ll get her up to bed\u201d you announced, standing up from the sofa, \u201cThink I\u2019ll head to bed myself\u201d. Tae nodded, knowing how tired you must be, trying to earn a living and look after your daughter. \u201cI\u2019ll just sleep on the sofa\u201d he stated, rubbing his thighs. \u201cYou can share my bed it\u2019s fine\u201d you told him as you exited the living room. He watched you gently put Gi down in her crib, watching you both adoringly. You tiptoed away from the sleeping child, closing the door to her room slightly, leaving it ajar so you could hear her during the night. You both wandered to your room, suddenly feeling like teenagers once more. The last time he was in your old bedroom was the night of your 21<sup>st</sup> birthday, a night that he\u2019d never forget. He began to take off his clothes, both of you stood in the darkness. You held the hem of your t-shirt in your hands, ready to take it off. \u201cI\u2019ll give you some privacy\u201d Taehyung stated, heading towards the bedroom door. \u201cPlease Taehyung, it\u2019s not something you haven\u2019t seen before\u201d. He nodded to himself, still stood by the door. Lights from the street lamps outside were producing a glow into the room, creating a silhouette of your body. You slipped the top over your head, your frame somehow looking smaller than usual. Your eyes caught Tae\u2019s, both looking at each other with lust. \u201cY/N\u201d he whispered, his breath shaking, now walking towards you. His hands trailed around your waist slowly, his fingertips dancing delicately over your skin, a single finger tracing the outline of your spine, his movements making your head fall back slightly. Bending his head towards you, his nose nudged your ear, pressing a kiss underneath it. \u201cI know we can\u2019t be together, but please let me be in your life, her life, I need you both\u201d he admitted, kissing your neck tenderly. \u201cWe need you too\u201d you replied, your hand clutching around the back of his neck. He nudged your nose, lips brushing yours slightly as he brought your body closer to his, feeling each other\u2019s flesh against one another. \u201cHave me one last time, just for tonight\u201d you suggested, your fingertips trailing down his chest and stomach. He didn\u2019t answer you, instead he kissed you, his tongue parting your lips, both of you moaning into each other\u2019s mouths, it was obvious how much you had missed each other, it was obvious how much you still loved one another, the thoughts pushed into the corner of the room, scared to admit it. </p><p>The sex between you both was slow and intimate, as though you were savouring each touch, knowing that it would be the last time. His forearms were either side of your head, his mouth open against yours, both panting into each other\u2019s mouths. One of your hands pulled the hair at the back of his head, the action making him moan into your mouth as he pressed a kiss to your lips. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you\u201d he moaned, his head nuzzling into your neck, trying to mute his moans against your skin, not wanting to wake the others, \u201cI\u2019ve missed you too\u201d you groaned back, your other hand gripping to his bum cheek. You could feel his thrusts becoming sloppy, indicating that he was close. You began to thrust your own hips upwards, your hips bones meeting his skin with every plunge. \u201cKeep doing that\u201d he moaned, nudging your nose with his before kissing you lovingly, his tongue caressing yours. One of his arms moved from the side of your head, hooking underneath your thigh, creating a deeper thrust, the feeling making you both groan out in pleasure. \u201cThere\u201d you moaned, squeezing his bicep, you could see the concentration on his face, he wanted you to feel good. \u201cTae\u201d you whined, your head going back into the pillow, he took this moment to pepper your neck with kisses, \u201cCum for me sweetheart\u201d he whispered in your ear, taking the lobe between your teeth. It was as though his words had spurred your climax, you took his chin with your finger, pressing a kiss to his lips, \u201cCum with me\u201d you gasped against his mouth. There you both were, climaxing in unison, both of moaning into one another\u2019s mouths. He laid in-between your legs for a few moments, still inside of you, looking down at your endearingly. You brushed his sweat ridden hair out of his face, your thumb stroking his cheek. He leant down, pressing a soft kiss against your lips before removing himself and heading towards the bathroom to clean himself up. </p><p>He returned to the bedroom, slipping back under the covers, your back now facing his direction, his foot discreetly brushing your own once he was immersed into the covers. \u201cTae?\u201d you spoke, glancing over your shoulder. \u201cHmm?\u201d he responded, his foot still stroking yours soothingly. \u201cEven though it\u2019s not going to work between us, you won\u2019t lose us, I promise\u201d you told him, turning your head back to its original position, rubbing your cheek against the pillow in attempts to get comfortable. Silence took over the room for a moment, the sound of each other breathing was all that could be heard. The covers began to rustle, suddenly feeling Tae\u2019s arm wrap around your waist, pulling your back into his chest. Your hand clasped around his hand that was pressed against your stomach, his thumb brushing the skin below your belly button comfortingly. The silence was broken by your daughter crying in the next room. You went to lift yourself out of the covers when the hand that was pressed to your stomach held you back down, realising that Tae wasn\u2019t letting you leave the bed. \u201cI\u2019ll go, get some rest\u201d he assured, giving your stomach a slight squeeze before leaving you alone in the sheets. He put his boxers and a t-shirt on before leaving the bedroom, heading towards your daughter\u2019s bedroom. \u201cOh, sweetheart what\u2019s wrong?\u201d was what you heard him say, his words bringing a smile to your face, but it was his next sentence that made you feel the most secure and content for the first time in many months.</p><p> \u201cIt\u2019s okay baby, Tae\u2019s got you, I\u2019m not going anywhere I promise\u201d. </p><figure data-orig-width=\"268\" data-orig-height=\"338\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"sin-taehyung:MyKOonkp6-xbTMWv8G3iYQ:ZKv_cb2fr3HQA\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/576ff7d51696e4c9e9ccfaa758fc3ccf/tumblr_plum053QXu1wmc7sfo1_400.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"268\" data-orig-height=\"338\"></figure></p>",

Tae loved the way your mother treat him, it was always with such respect and kindness. </p><p>He was leant against the kitchen worktop, now holding a mug of tea beginning to take a sip, he was talking to your mother about their busy schedule when he was interrupted by your presence. &ldquo;Gi is finally napping-&rdquo; you paused, looking over at your friend, &ldquo;Tae&rdquo;, the ever so familiar nickname making his heart sink. &ldquo;Hi sweetheart&rdquo; he mumbled, biting his gum. You didn&rsquo;t know how to react, didn&rsquo;t know what to say or even think. &ldquo;Mum, can you give us a minute please?&rdquo; you asked, hoping she would take the hint, to which she did. She turned her pans on a low heat, beginning to head out of the kitchen to find your father. &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; you questioned him, walking over to him slowly. &ldquo;I could say the same for you&rdquo; he replied, crossing his foot over the other. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do this Tae, not now&rdquo; you hissed, standing in front of him, &ldquo;How dare you just turn up here, thinking that you can just arrive home after five months, acting as though everything is okay&rdquo;. He shook his head, tongue prodding the inside of his mouth with frustration. &ldquo;Oh yes, how dare I y/n, I think you&rsquo;ve forgotten you were the one that ended things before they had even started&rdquo; he snapped back, as though he wanted you to know that he didn&rsquo;t want to let you go. &ldquo;Yeah well, I guess we&rsquo;re even aren&rsquo;t we. You ended it first and I&rsquo;ll end it a second&rdquo; you answered, turning your head away from him. &ldquo;There was nothing to end the first time&rdquo; he whispered, not wanting your parents to hear you argue. &ldquo;You really believe that?&rdquo; you interrogated, your head close to his, &ldquo;That night meant nothing to you, is that what you&rsquo;re saying?&rdquo;, you could feel him breathing against your face. He shook his head once more, nudging your nose with his own, before leading his head towards your jaw, his lips brushing the rim of your ear. &ldquo;You know that night meant everything to me&rdquo; he whispered, his breath tickling your ear, the words making your breath shake. He nudged you once more, his hands cupping either side of your face, lips pressing delicately to your own, however, was interrupted by your mother coming into the kitchen. &ldquo;This doesn&rsquo;t change anything&rdquo; you mumbled, walking away from his embrace. &ldquo;Taehyung, are you staying for dinner?&rdquo; your mother asked as she was taking the pans off the hobs, before you could answer for him he interjected. &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;d be lovely thank you&rdquo; he replied, glaring over at you with a smirk across his face. </p><p>You had all finished dinner, casually talking sat around the dining room table, your parents catching up with Taehyung, praising him for his achievements. Mid conversation you heard Gi crying from upstairs, alerting you that she was awake from her nap. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be long, sorry&rdquo; you said as you stood up from your chair, heading upstairs. Opening the door, you could see your frustrated daughter in her crib, kicking her legs frantically. &ldquo;Hey, what&rsquo;s wrong gorgeous girl?&rdquo; you whispered as you picked her out of the cot, kissing her head softly. She cuddled immediately into your neck, finding comfort in your scent. You swayed from side to side, rubbing her back soothingly, her cries had stopped now that she was safe in your arms. You heard a subtle knock to the bedroom door, turning towards it you could see Tae stood against the door frame, hands tucked into his pockets. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s beautiful&rdquo; he mumbled, looking down at his feet, heart breaking into two, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s so big now&rdquo;. You had to swallow the lump forming in your throat, you knew how much she meant to him. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go and see Tae, hmm?&rdquo; you suggested to your daughter, walking over to the door frame. He was shocked when her arms reached towards him, as though she could remember him. Taking her from your grasp he wrapped his arms around her tiny frame, placing a kiss to her head, a thankful smile spreading across his face. &ldquo;Hi baby&rdquo; he whispered, rubbing his cheek against her head, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve missed you&rdquo;. You watched him hold her lovingly for a few moments, the feelings rushing back to you, the memories replaying in your head. You shook them away, knowing all too well that it wasn&rsquo;t a good idea to be thinking this way, you knew it would never work, he never had time for the both of you. &ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s go and see grandma and grandad?&rdquo; you suggested, walking out of the bedroom towards the stairs, hoping Tae and your daughter would follow. </p><p>The night was relaxed, Gi didn&rsquo;t leave Taehyung&rsquo;s side all night. She was constantly crawling over to him, passing him her favourite toys, laughing at every funny face he pulled. You were sat next to him, your head naturally resting against his shoulder out of habit, his arm draped around your shoulders. He bounced Gi up and down on his knees, the motion making her chuckle, her laugh echoing throughout the room. Your mother observed the three of you in awe, noticing how effortlessly you all interacted with one another, noticing how perfect you fit together. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll leave you kids in peace, we&rsquo;re going to head to bed, I&rsquo;ll make breakfast for us all in the morning, sleep well&rdquo; your mother informed, kissing yours and Gi&rsquo;s heads. She cupped Tae&rsquo;s cheek with her hand, smiling endearingly at him, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to have you home Kim Taehyung&rdquo;, the comment making your heart sink. Tae didn&rsquo;t know what to do but smile as a response, scared that if he opened his mouth he&rsquo;d begin to cry. </p><p>It was an hour later and Gi had fallen asleep on Tae&rsquo;s chest, her hand randomly clutching his ear. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get her up to bed&rdquo; you announced, standing up from the sofa, &ldquo;Think I&rsquo;ll head to bed myself&rdquo;. Tae nodded, knowing how tired you must be, trying to earn a living and look after your daughter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just sleep on the sofa&rdquo; he stated, rubbing his thighs. &ldquo;You can share my bed it&rsquo;s fine&rdquo; you told him as you exited the living room. He watched you gently put Gi down in her crib, watching you both adoringly. You tiptoed away from the sleeping child, closing the door to her room slightly, leaving it ajar so you could hear her during the night. You both wandered to your room, suddenly feeling like teenagers once more. The last time he was in your old bedroom was the night of your 21<sup>st</sup> birthday, a night that he&rsquo;d never forget. He began to take off his clothes, both of you stood in the darkness. You held the hem of your t-shirt in your hands, ready to take it off. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you some privacy&rdquo; Taehyung stated, heading towards the bedroom door. &ldquo;Please Taehyung, it&rsquo;s not something you haven&rsquo;t seen before&rdquo;. He nodded to himself, still stood by the door. Lights from the street lamps outside were producing a glow into the room, creating a silhouette of your body. You slipped the top over your head, your frame somehow looking smaller than usual. Your eyes caught Tae&rsquo;s, both looking at each other with lust. &ldquo;Y/N&rdquo; he whispered, his breath shaking, now walking towards you. His hands trailed around your waist slowly, his fingertips dancing delicately over your skin, a single finger tracing the outline of your spine, his movements making your head fall back slightly. Bending his head towards you, his nose nudged your ear, pressing a kiss underneath it. &ldquo;I know we can&rsquo;t be together, but please let me be in your life, her life, I need you both&rdquo; he admitted, kissing your neck tenderly. &ldquo;We need you too&rdquo; you replied, your hand clutching around the back of his neck. He nudged your nose, lips brushing yours slightly as he brought your body closer to his, feeling each other&rsquo;s flesh against one another. &ldquo;Have me one last time, just for tonight&rdquo; you suggested, your fingertips trailing down his chest and stomach. He didn&rsquo;t answer you, instead he kissed you, his tongue parting your lips, both of you moaning into each other&rsquo;s mouths, it was obvious how much you had missed each other, it was obvious how much you still loved one another, the thoughts pushed into the corner of the room, scared to admit it. </p><p>The sex between you both was slow and intimate, as though you were savouring each touch, knowing that it would be the last time. His forearms were either side of your head, his mouth open against yours, both panting into each other&rsquo;s mouths. One of your hands pulled the hair at the back of his head, the action making him moan into your mouth as he pressed a kiss to your lips. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve missed you&rdquo; he moaned, his head nuzzling into your neck, trying to mute his moans against your skin, not wanting to wake the others, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve missed you too&rdquo; you groaned back, your other hand gripping to his bum cheek. You could feel his thrusts becoming sloppy, indicating that he was close. You began to thrust your own hips upwards, your hips bones meeting his skin with every plunge. &ldquo;Keep doing that&rdquo; he moaned, nudging your nose with his before kissing you lovingly, his tongue caressing yours. One of his arms moved from the side of your head, hooking underneath your thigh, creating a deeper thrust, the feeling making you both groan out in pleasure. &ldquo;There&rdquo; you moaned, squeezing his bicep, you could see the concentration on his face, he wanted you to feel good. &ldquo;Tae&rdquo; you whined, your head going back into the pillow, he took this moment to pepper your neck with kisses, &ldquo;Cum for me sweetheart&rdquo; he whispered in your ear, taking the lobe between your teeth. It was as though his words had spurred your climax, you took his chin with your finger, pressing a kiss to his lips, &ldquo;Cum with me&rdquo; you gasped against his mouth. There you both were, climaxing in unison, both of moaning into one another&rsquo;s mouths. He laid in-between your legs for a few moments, still inside of you, looking down at your endearingly. You brushed his sweat ridden hair out of his face, your thumb stroking his cheek. He leant down, pressing a soft kiss against your lips before removing himself and heading towards the bathroom to clean himself up. </p><p>He returned to the bedroom, slipping back under the covers, your back now facing his direction, his foot discreetly brushing your own once he was immersed into the covers. &ldquo;Tae?&rdquo; you spoke, glancing over your shoulder. &ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo; he responded, his foot still stroking yours soothingly. &ldquo;Even though it&rsquo;s not going to work between us, you won&rsquo;t lose us, I promise&rdquo; you told him, turning your head back to its original position, rubbing your cheek against the pillow in attempts to get comfortable. Silence took over the room for a moment, the sound of each other breathing was all that could be heard. The covers began to rustle, suddenly feeling Tae&rsquo;s arm wrap around your waist, pulling your back into his chest. Your hand clasped around his hand that was pressed against your stomach, his thumb brushing the skin below your belly button comfortingly. The silence was broken by your daughter crying in the next room. You went to lift yourself out of the covers when the hand that was pressed to your stomach held you back down, realising that Tae wasn&rsquo;t letting you leave the bed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go, get some rest&rdquo; he assured, giving your stomach a slight squeeze before leaving you alone in the sheets. He put his boxers and a t-shirt on before leaving the bedroom, heading towards your daughter&rsquo;s bedroom. &ldquo;Oh, sweetheart what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; was what you heard him say, his words bringing a smile to your face, but it was his next sentence that made you feel the most secure and content for the first time in many months.</p><p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay baby, Tae&rsquo;s got you, I&rsquo;m not going anywhere I promise&rdquo;. </p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure></p>",

Have you two ever broken up?</i></b></b><br/></b></b></p><p>\u201cFour years,\u201d Jimin giggled. \u201cWeird to think that it\u2019s been that long.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cIt really is because so much has happened,\u201d you nodded in agreement as you motioned down at Noah. \u201cAs for break ups, we broke up like twice when we were still just dating.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cBoth of those times, we broke up over not being able to see each other much and spend time together,\u201d Jimin mumbled. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t want to lose her so I did what I had to do, in terms of making time for her, and now here we are.\u201d</p><p><b><i>Pregnancy sex?</i></b></p><p>\u201cOh yeah,\u201d Jimin smirked and you blushed harshly.<br/></p><p>\u201cIt was my pregnancy hormones,\u201d you lamely said.<br/></p><p><b><i>What was your weirdest pregnancy craving?</i></b></p><p>\u201cThe stereotypical\u00a0pickles,\u201d you laughed.\u00a0\u201cWe always had to have a jar of them in the house.\u201d<br/></p><p><b><i>Describe Noah, personality and looks wise.\u00a0Does Noah crave affection like Jimin?</i></b></p><p>\u201cJimin doesn\u2019t call Noah \u2018mini-me\u2019 for no reason,\u201d you state. \u201cLooks just like him and acts just like him too.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cHe can be a little shy sometimes and he tends to need a lot of reassurance to try new things, but he\u2019s a sweet kid,\u201d Jimin added. <br/></p><p>\u201cHe does crave affection like Jimin, which I love because I get lots of baby cuddles,\u201d you laughed.<br/></p><p>\u201cWe both do,\u201d Jimin corrected.</p><p><b><i>\n\nWhat was it like to going back to work after the baby was born?\n\n<br/></i></b></p><p>\u201cIt was hard because Noah didn\u2019t adjust well to daycare at first,\u201d you revealed. \u201cBecause he\u2019s shy, he has a hard time being around new people.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThankfully, he got used to it after about two weeks and he loves it now,\u201d Jimin said. \u201cAs for me personally, I didn\u2019t like going back to work after he was born.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t?\u201d You looked over at Jimin with a raised eyebrow and he shook his head. \u201cYou never told me that.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cBecause I knew that I had to just get used to it,\u201d Jimin confessed. \u201cI couldn\u2019t just drop my commitments to the group but anytime I went to work after Noah was born, I just wanted to be back here at home with him and you.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAw Jimin-ssi,\u201d you cooed, reaching over and patting his cheek with your hand. \u201cFor me, it was reliving to go back to work because I missed it. I also loved the feeling of getting to come home after a long but good day at work and getting to see not only Jimin, but this beautiful little face too,\u201d you grinned as you pressed a kiss to Noah\u2019s chubby cheek, making him squeal.</p><p><b><i>How do you manage when he\u2019s on tour?</i></b></p><p>\u201cI hate it when he has to leave,\u201d you blurt out, making Jimin look over at you with a frown on his face. \u201cEven though Noah is still young, he definitely notices when Jimin is gone and that makes him sad. In turn, I become even more upset because not only is Jimin gone, but now Noah\u2019s sad,\u201d you explain. <br/></p><p>\u201cJagiya,\u201d Jimin murmurs as he moves closer to you. He wraps an arm around your shoulder, pulling you into his side. \u201cI know, I hate having to leave you guys too.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI usually just try to keep myself, and Noah, occupied until he gets back. Things like taking Noah to the park, play dates with the boys\u2019 other kids, anything really,\u201d you listed. \u201cThat usually helps the time pass faster.\u201d</p><p><b><i>Has Noah been to the BigHit building? If so, how do you keep him occupied?</i></b></p><p>\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been a few times, the rare days where we don\u2019t want to send him to daycare but Y/N-ah has to go into work for a few hours so he comes with me,\u201d Jimin nods. \u201cNoah loves watching us perform so I never really struggle to keep his attention. Plus, he loves the members and our staff as well so there\u2019s always someone to keep him occupied if need be.\u201d\n\n<br/></p><p><b><i>Do you guys post lots of photos of Noah, or do you prefer to maintain some privacy when it comes to him?</i></b></p><p>\u201cWe love posting photos of Noah,\u201d you answered. \u201cEspecially these cute little photo collages comparing him to old photos of Jimin, since they look so much alike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile Y/N was still pregnant, we discussed how much we\u2019d post him and we decided that we wouldn\u2019t let any potential trolls stop us from posting things about our child, who we love very much and are insanely proud of,\u201d Jimin explained. </p><p><b><i>How do you deal with tantrums?</i></b></p><p>\u201cJimin doesn\u2019t,\u201d you answered immediately, making him look over at you.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? I do deal with his tantrums,\u201d Jimin refuted.<br/></p><p>\u201cGiving him what he wants is not\u00a0\u2018dealing with it\u2019,\u201d you chuckled.<br/></p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not my fault I have a soft spot for him,\u201d Jimin murmured and you rolled your eyes playfully.<br/></p><p>\u201cSince Noah is so sweet, he doesn&rsquo;t like being yelled at so if I just gently scold him, that does the trick,\u201d you said.<br/></p><p><b><i>How often do you and Jimin get to spend time together? Sexually too? Favorite sex position?</i></b></p><p>\u201cWe make it a point to spend at least an hour together every night, if we can,\u201d you articulated. \u201cAfter having Noah, we made an agreement to make sure that our relationship doesn\u2019t get lost in the busyness that is our everyday lives.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cBetween her job, my job, and taking care of Noah, it would be way too easy to let our relationship fall to the wayside,\u201d Jimin elaborated. \u201cWe love and value each other way too much to let that happen.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAs for sex, we still haven\u2019t perfected that yet,\u201d you blushed. \u201cSometimes, we\u2019ll go three weeks without more than a kiss; other times, we\u2019ll have sex every night so it really just depends.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cFor favorite sex position, I\u2019d say cowgirl for me,\u201d Jimin smirked. \u201cI love being able to look at her.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou say that as if I don\u2019t catch you staring at me all the time anyways,\u201d you teased, making him blush and bury his face in your neck. \u201cIt\u2019d be cowgirl or doggy for me.\u201d</p><p><b><i>What\u2019s something that he does that gets on your nerves? And vice versa?</i></b></p><p>\u201cSometimes, I don\u2019t like the fact that he has such a soft spot for Noah,\u201d you mutter. \u201cThat soft spot makes it damn near impossible for Jimin to reprimand him or scold him effectively, which leads to me having to do it and I feel like it makes me look like the bad guy all the time.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ve apologized for that and it\u2019s something I\u2019m working on,\u201d Jimin chimed in and you nodded in confirmation. \u201cFor me, I don\u2019t like how she has a tendency to not tell me when she\u2019s struggling with things. She can walk around and pretend that everything is fine and then all of a sudden, she has an outburst about things that happened three weeks ago,\u201d he stated.<br/></p><p>\u201cI just never want to bother you,\u201d you whisper.<br/></p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019re a team,\u201d Jimin reminded you. \u201cYour problems are my problems and vice versa. If you\u2019re struggling, then so am I. That\u2019s a part of my job as your husband and partner, to be your support system, ok?\u201d You nodded and pressed a soft kiss to his lips.</p><p><b><i>Jimin, has Noah ever copied anything that you\u2019ve done? And how did you react?</i></b></p><p>\u201cOh, tell them about that time when you took him to rehearsals for the tour,\u201d you interjected and Jimin laughed as he remembered what you were referring to.<br/></p><p>\u201cSo, there was a day where Y/N had to go to work so I took Noah to rehearsal with me. We were practicing for our tour so there\u2019s a section where I perform Serendipity. The time came for me to rehearse that section and Noah was off on the side of the stage with Hobi hyung,\u201d Jimin explained. \u201cWhen the part comes that I kind of grind onto the floor, Noah tried to copy me and ended up falling right on his face.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cHe still has the little bruise on his forehead to prove it,\u201d you chimed in, laughing softly.<br/></p><p>\u201cI felt so bad because he was really trying,\u201d Jimin pouted. \u201cBut I also was insanely proud because not only had he been watching me but he understood the concept of what I was doing, which makes me hopeful that he\u2019ll pick up dancing someday.\u201d</p><p><b><i>How do you feel about Y/N after watching her give birth? How has it changed your bond/connection?</i></b></p><p>\u201cShe was already my favorite person before she got pregnant but after watching her go through that whole process, especially her labor, it just made me value and respect her so much more than I already did,\u201d Jimin confessed.\u00a0\u201cHer labor was so hard for her and she handled it like a pro.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019d do it all over again for Noah,\u201d you assured, smiling down at Noah.</p><p>\u201cAs for our bond or connection, I don\u2019t think much has changed,\u201d Jimin said.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve always valued each other so I think having Noah and parenting him together has only strengthened it.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI think the real reason he hasn\u2019t noticed a change in our bond or connection is because Jimin has always treated me as if I was a princess,\u201d you smiled, making him blush lightly.\u00a0<br/></p><p><b><i>What\u2019s something that you love most about being a parent? Or something that you wish you knew before becoming a parent?</i></b></p><p>\u201cI wish I had known how kids literally take over your life,\u201d you giggled.\u00a0\u201cEverything we do now, from making big family decisions to things as simple as what to have for dinner, Noah is always the first thing that comes to both of our minds.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cDefinitely,\u201d Jimin nodded.\u00a0\u201cPlus, when you have a kid, you become known as only that child\u2019s parent. I mean, my parents don\u2019t call me just to talk to me anymore. They\u2019ll literally facetime me to see Noah and then hang up once they\u2019re done.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cMy family is the same way,\u201d you agreed.\u00a0\u201cThe text threads between me and my mom and dad are literally only pictures and videos of Noah, and nothing else.\u201d<br/></p><p><b><i>Have you ever had a moment when you\u2019ve looked at Y/N and Noah and been amazed? Or just felt so in love? </i></b></p><p>\u201cNow that Noah is crawling and is about to start walking, he follows Y/N around the house a lot,\u201d Jimin smiled.\u00a0\u201cThe other day, I was in the kitchen finishing dinner and when I went out into the living room to get them, she was walking around the living room and letting Noah chase after her. He was giggling so loudly and they both had the biggest smiles on their faces. That\u2019s something that I\u2019ll always remember.\u201d<br/></p><p><b><i>Do you want more kids? What would you name a girl?</i></b></p><p>\u201cWe would love more kids,\u201d Jimin answers and you nod in agreement. <br/></p><p>\u201cJimin owes me a kid that looks like me,\u201d you joke, making Jimin giggle loudly. \u201cAs for what we would name a girl, I think we\u2019d still go with Emma. That\u2019s the name that we had for Noah, had he been a girl. Right?\u201d You looked at Jimin and he nodded.</p><p><b><i>Hopes for the future?</i></b></p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to teach Noah how to dance once he learns to walk and is a little more coordinated,\u201d Jimin replied as he grinned widely.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cUm, I\u2019m pretty happy with how our lives have been going so far. I think the only thing I\u2019d add is another kid soon but besides that, I\u2019m good,\u201d you nodded.<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019d say that life is pretty damn amazing right now,\u201d Jimin added.\u00a0\u201cI have Y/N, I have Noah.

I also loved the feeling of getting to come home after a long but good day at work and getting to see not only Jimin, but this beautiful little face too,\u201d you grinned as you pressed a kiss to Noah\u2019s chubby cheek, making him squeal.</p><p><b><i>How do you manage when he\u2019s on tour?</i></b></p><p>\u201cI hate it when he has to leave,\u201d you blurt out, making Jimin look over at you with a frown on his face. \u201cEven though Noah is still young, he definitely notices when Jimin is gone and that makes him sad. In turn, I become even more upset because not only is Jimin gone, but now Noah\u2019s sad,\u201d you explain. <br></p><p>\u201cJagiya,\u201d Jimin murmurs as he moves closer to you. He wraps an arm around your shoulder, pulling you into his side. \u201cI know, I hate having to leave you guys too.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI usually just try to keep myself, and Noah, occupied until he gets back. Things like taking Noah to the park, play dates with the boys\u2019 other kids, anything really,\u201d you listed. \u201cThat usually helps the time pass faster.\u201d</p><p><b><i>Has Noah been to the BigHit building? If so, how do you keep him occupied?</i></b></p><p>\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been a few times, the rare days where we don\u2019t want to send him to daycare but Y/N-ah has to go into work for a few hours so he comes with me,\u201d Jimin nods. \u201cNoah loves watching us perform so I never really struggle to keep his attention. Plus, he loves the members and our staff as well so there\u2019s always someone to keep him occupied if need be.\u201d\n\n<br></p><p><b><i>Do you guys post lots of photos of Noah, or do you prefer to maintain some privacy when it comes to him?</i></b></p><p>\u201cWe love posting photos of Noah,\u201d you answered. \u201cEspecially these cute little photo collages comparing him to old photos of Jimin, since they look so much alike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile Y/N was still pregnant, we discussed how much we\u2019d post him and we decided that we wouldn\u2019t let any potential trolls stop us from posting things about our child, who we love very much and are insanely proud of,\u201d Jimin explained. </p><p><b><i>How do you deal with tantrums?</i></b></p><p>\u201cJimin doesn\u2019t,\u201d you answered immediately, making him look over at you.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? I do deal with his tantrums,\u201d Jimin refuted.<br></p><p>\u201cGiving him what he wants is not\u00a0\u2018dealing with it\u2019,\u201d you chuckled.<br></p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not my fault I have a soft spot for him,\u201d Jimin murmured and you rolled your eyes playfully.<br></p><p>\u201cSince Noah is so sweet, he doesn\u2019t like being yelled at so if I just gently scold him, that does the trick,\u201d you said.<br></p><p><b><i>How often do you and Jimin get to spend time together? Sexually too? Favorite sex position?</i></b></p><p>\u201cWe make it a point to spend at least an hour together every night, if we can,\u201d you articulated. \u201cAfter having Noah, we made an agreement to make sure that our relationship doesn\u2019t get lost in the busyness that is our everyday lives.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBetween her job, my job, and taking care of Noah, it would be way too easy to let our relationship fall to the wayside,\u201d Jimin elaborated. \u201cWe love and value each other way too much to let that happen.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAs for sex, we still haven\u2019t perfected that yet,\u201d you blushed. \u201cSometimes, we\u2019ll go three weeks without more than a kiss; other times, we\u2019ll have sex every night so it really just depends.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cFor favorite sex position, I\u2019d say cowgirl for me,\u201d Jimin smirked. \u201cI love being able to look at her.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou say that as if I don\u2019t catch you staring at me all the time anyways,\u201d you teased, making him blush and bury his face in your neck. \u201cIt\u2019d be cowgirl or doggy for me.\u201d</p><p><b><i>What\u2019s something that he does that gets on your nerves? And vice versa?</i></b></p><p>\u201cSometimes, I don\u2019t like the fact that he has such a soft spot for Noah,\u201d you mutter. \u201cThat soft spot makes it damn near impossible for Jimin to reprimand him or scold him effectively, which leads to me having to do it and I feel like it makes me look like the bad guy all the time.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ve apologized for that and it\u2019s something I\u2019m working on,\u201d Jimin chimed in and you nodded in confirmation. \u201cFor me, I don\u2019t like how she has a tendency to not tell me when she\u2019s struggling with things. She can walk around and pretend that everything is fine and then all of a sudden, she has an outburst about things that happened three weeks ago,\u201d he stated.<br></p><p>\u201cI just never want to bother you,\u201d you whisper.<br></p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019re a team,\u201d Jimin reminded you. \u201cYour problems are my problems and vice versa. If you\u2019re struggling, then so am I. That\u2019s a part of my job as your husband and partner, to be your support system, ok?\u201d You nodded and pressed a soft kiss to his lips.</p><p><b><i>Jimin, has Noah ever copied anything that you\u2019ve done? And how did you react?</i></b></p><p>\u201cOh, tell them about that time when you took him to rehearsals for the tour,\u201d you interjected and Jimin laughed as he remembered what you were referring to.<br></p><p>\u201cSo, there was a day where Y/N had to go to work so I took Noah to rehearsal with me. We were practicing for our tour so there\u2019s a section where I perform Serendipity. The time came for me to rehearse that section and Noah was off on the side of the stage with Hobi hyung,\u201d Jimin explained. \u201cWhen the part comes that I kind of grind onto the floor, Noah tried to copy me and ended up falling right on his face.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cHe still has the little bruise on his forehead to prove it,\u201d you chimed in, laughing softly.<br></p><p>\u201cI felt so bad because he was really trying,\u201d Jimin pouted. \u201cBut I also was insanely proud because not only had he been watching me but he understood the concept of what I was doing, which makes me hopeful that he\u2019ll pick up dancing someday.\u201d</p><p><b><i>How do you feel about Y/N after watching her give birth? How has it changed your bond/connection?</i></b></p><p>\u201cShe was already my favorite person before she got pregnant but after watching her go through that whole process, especially her labor, it just made me value and respect her so much more than I already did,\u201d Jimin confessed.\u00a0\u201cHer labor was so hard for her and she handled it like a pro.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019d do it all over again for Noah,\u201d you assured, smiling down at Noah.</p><p>\u201cAs for our bond or connection, I don\u2019t think much has changed,\u201d Jimin said.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve always valued each other so I think having Noah and parenting him together has only strengthened it.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI think the real reason he hasn\u2019t noticed a change in our bond or connection is because Jimin has always treated me as if I was a princess,\u201d you smiled, making him blush lightly.\u00a0<br></p><p><b><i>What\u2019s something that you love most about being a parent? Or something that you wish you knew before becoming a parent?</i></b></p><p>\u201cI wish I had known how kids literally take over your life,\u201d you giggled.\u00a0\u201cEverything we do now, from making big family decisions to things as simple as what to have for dinner, Noah is always the first thing that comes to both of our minds.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDefinitely,\u201d Jimin nodded.\u00a0\u201cPlus, when you have a kid, you become known as only that child\u2019s parent. I mean, my parents don\u2019t call me just to talk to me anymore. They\u2019ll literally facetime me to see Noah and then hang up once they\u2019re done.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cMy family is the same way,\u201d you agreed.\u00a0\u201cThe text threads between me and my mom and dad are literally only pictures and videos of Noah, and nothing else.\u201d<br></p><p><b><i>Have you ever had a moment when you\u2019ve looked at Y/N and Noah and been amazed? Or just felt so in love? </i></b></p><p>\u201cNow that Noah is crawling and is about to start walking, he follows Y/N around the house a lot,\u201d Jimin smiled.\u00a0\u201cThe other day, I was in the kitchen finishing dinner and when I went out into the living room to get them, she was walking around the living room and letting Noah chase after her. He was giggling so loudly and they both had the biggest smiles on their faces. That\u2019s something that I\u2019ll always remember.\u201d<br></p><p><b><i>Do you want more kids? What would you name a girl?</i></b></p><p>\u201cWe would love more kids,\u201d Jimin answers and you nod in agreement. <br></p><p>\u201cJimin owes me a kid that looks like me,\u201d you joke, making Jimin giggle loudly. \u201cAs for what we would name a girl, I think we\u2019d still go with Emma. That\u2019s the name that we had for Noah, had he been a girl. Right?\u201d You looked at Jimin and he nodded.</p><p><b><i>Hopes for the future?</i></b></p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to teach Noah how to dance once he learns to walk and is a little more coordinated,\u201d Jimin replied as he grinned widely.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cUm, I\u2019m pretty happy with how our lives have been going so far. I think the only thing I\u2019d add is another kid soon but besides that, I\u2019m good,\u201d you nodded.<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019d say that life is pretty damn amazing right now,\u201d Jimin added.\u00a0\u201cI have Y/N, I have Noah. What more could I really need?\u201d You leaned over and kissed his cheek as Noah squealed loudly at the sight.\u00a0<br></p>",

Favorite sex position?</i></b></p><p>\u201cWe make it a point to spend at least an hour together every night, if we can,\u201d you articulated. \u201cAfter having Noah, we made an agreement to make sure that our relationship doesn\u2019t get lost in the busyness that is our everyday lives.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBetween her job, my job, and taking care of Noah, it would be way too easy to let our relationship fall to the wayside,\u201d Jimin elaborated. \u201cWe love and value each other way too much to let that happen.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAs for sex, we still haven\u2019t perfected that yet,\u201d you blushed. \u201cSometimes, we\u2019ll go three weeks without more than a kiss; other times, we\u2019ll have sex every night so it really just depends.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cFor favorite sex position, I\u2019d say cowgirl for me,\u201d Jimin smirked. \u201cI love being able to look at her.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou say that as if I don\u2019t catch you staring at me all the time anyways,\u201d you teased, making him blush and bury his face in your neck. \u201cIt\u2019d be cowgirl or doggy for me.\u201d</p><p><b><i>What\u2019s something that he does that gets on your nerves? And vice versa?</i></b></p><p>\u201cSometimes, I don\u2019t like the fact that he has such a soft spot for Noah,\u201d you mutter. \u201cThat soft spot makes it damn near impossible for Jimin to reprimand him or scold him effectively, which leads to me having to do it and I feel like it makes me look like the bad guy all the time.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ve apologized for that and it\u2019s something I\u2019m working on,\u201d Jimin chimed in and you nodded in confirmation. \u201cFor me, I don\u2019t like how she has a tendency to not tell me when she\u2019s struggling with things. She can walk around and pretend that everything is fine and then all of a sudden, she has an outburst about things that happened three weeks ago,\u201d he stated.<br></p><p>\u201cI just never want to bother you,\u201d you whisper.<br></p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019re a team,\u201d Jimin reminded you. \u201cYour problems are my problems and vice versa. If you\u2019re struggling, then so am I. That\u2019s a part of my job as your husband and partner, to be your support system, ok?\u201d You nodded and pressed a soft kiss to his lips.</p><p><b><i>Jimin, has Noah ever copied anything that you\u2019ve done? And how did you react?</i></b></p><p>\u201cOh, tell them about that time when you took him to rehearsals for the tour,\u201d you interjected and Jimin laughed as he remembered what you were referring to.<br></p><p>\u201cSo, there was a day where Y/N had to go to work so I took Noah to rehearsal with me. We were practicing for our tour so there\u2019s a section where I perform Serendipity. The time came for me to rehearse that section and Noah was off on the side of the stage with Hobi hyung,\u201d Jimin explained. \u201cWhen the part comes that I kind of grind onto the floor, Noah tried to copy me and ended up falling right on his face.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cHe still has the little bruise on his forehead to prove it,\u201d you chimed in, laughing softly.<br></p><p>\u201cI felt so bad because he was really trying,\u201d Jimin pouted. \u201cBut I also was insanely proud because not only had he been watching me but he understood the concept of what I was doing, which makes me hopeful that he\u2019ll pick up dancing someday.\u201d</p><p><b><i>How do you feel about Y/N after watching her give birth? How has it changed your bond/connection?</i></b></p><p>\u201cShe was already my favorite person before she got pregnant but after watching her go through that whole process, especially her labor, it just made me value and respect her so much more than I already did,\u201d Jimin confessed.\u00a0\u201cHer labor was so hard for her and she handled it like a pro.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019d do it all over again for Noah,\u201d you assured, smiling down at Noah.</p><p>\u201cAs for our bond or connection, I don\u2019t think much has changed,\u201d Jimin said.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve always valued each other so I think having Noah and parenting him together has only strengthened it.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI think the real reason he hasn\u2019t noticed a change in our bond or connection is because Jimin has always treated me as if I was a princess,\u201d you smiled, making him blush lightly.\u00a0<br></p><p><b><i>What\u2019s something that you love most about being a parent? Or something that you wish you knew before becoming a parent?</i></b></p><p>\u201cI wish I had known how kids literally take over your life,\u201d you giggled.\u00a0\u201cEverything we do now, from making big family decisions to things as simple as what to have for dinner, Noah is always the first thing that comes to both of our minds.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDefinitely,\u201d Jimin nodded.\u00a0\u201cPlus, when you have a kid, you become known as only that child\u2019s parent. I mean, my parents don\u2019t call me just to talk to me anymore. They\u2019ll literally facetime me to see Noah and then hang up once they\u2019re done.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cMy family is the same way,\u201d you agreed.\u00a0\u201cThe text threads between me and my mom and dad are literally only pictures and videos of Noah, and nothing else.\u201d<br></p><p><b><i>Have you ever had a moment when you\u2019ve looked at Y/N and Noah and been amazed? Or just felt so in love? </i></b></p><p>\u201cNow that Noah is crawling and is about to start walking, he follows Y/N around the house a lot,\u201d Jimin smiled.\u00a0\u201cThe other day, I was in the kitchen finishing dinner and when I went out into the living room to get them, she was walking around the living room and letting Noah chase after her. He was giggling so loudly and they both had the biggest smiles on their faces. That\u2019s something that I\u2019ll always remember.\u201d<br></p><p><b><i>Do you want more kids? What would you name a girl?</i></b></p><p>\u201cWe would love more kids,\u201d Jimin answers and you nod in agreement. <br></p><p>\u201cJimin owes me a kid that looks like me,\u201d you joke, making Jimin giggle loudly. \u201cAs for what we would name a girl, I think we\u2019d still go with Emma. That\u2019s the name that we had for Noah, had he been a girl. Right?\u201d You looked at Jimin and he nodded.</p><p><b><i>Hopes for the future?</i></b></p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to teach Noah how to dance once he learns to walk and is a little more coordinated,\u201d Jimin replied as he grinned widely.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cUm, I\u2019m pretty happy with how our lives have been going so far. I think the only thing I\u2019d add is another kid soon but besides that, I\u2019m good,\u201d you nodded.<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019d say that life is pretty damn amazing right now,\u201d Jimin added.\u00a0\u201cI have Y/N, I have Noah. What more could I really need?\u201d You leaned over and kissed his cheek as Noah squealed loudly at the sight.\u00a0<br></p>",

Have you two ever broken up?</i></b></b><br /></b></b></p><p>&ldquo;Four years,&rdquo; Jimin giggled. &ldquo;Weird to think that it&rsquo;s been that long.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It really is because so much has happened,&rdquo; you nodded in agreement as you motioned down at Noah. &ldquo;As for break ups, we broke up like twice when we were still just dating.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Both of those times, we broke up over not being able to see each other much and spend time together,&rdquo; Jimin mumbled. &ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t want to lose her so I did what I had to do, in terms of making time for her, and now here we are.&rdquo;</p><p><b><i>Pregnancy sex?</i></b></p><p>&ldquo;Oh yeah,&rdquo; Jimin smirked and you blushed harshly.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It was my pregnancy hormones,&rdquo; you lamely said.<br /></p><p><b><i>What was your weirdest pregnancy craving?</i></b></p><p>&ldquo;The stereotypical&nbsp;pickles,&rdquo; you laughed.&nbsp;&ldquo;We always had to have a jar of them in the house.&rdquo;<br /></p><p><b><i>Describe Noah, personality and looks wise.&nbsp;Does Noah crave affection like Jimin?</i></b></p><p>&ldquo;Jimin doesn&rsquo;t call Noah &lsquo;mini-me&rsquo; for no reason,&rdquo; you state. &ldquo;Looks just like him and acts just like him too.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;He can be a little shy sometimes and he tends to need a lot of reassurance to try new things, but he&rsquo;s a sweet kid,&rdquo; Jimin added. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;He does crave affection like Jimin, which I love because I get lots of baby cuddles,&rdquo; you laughed.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;We both do,&rdquo; Jimin corrected.</p><p><b><i>\n\nWhat was it like to going back to work after the baby was born?\n\n<br /></i></b></p><p>&ldquo;It was hard because Noah didn&rsquo;t adjust well to daycare at first,&rdquo; you revealed. &ldquo;Because he&rsquo;s shy, he has a hard time being around new people.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Thankfully, he got used to it after about two weeks and he loves it now,&rdquo; Jimin said. &ldquo;As for me personally, I didn&rsquo;t like going back to work after he was born.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; You looked over at Jimin with a raised eyebrow and he shook his head. &ldquo;You never told me that.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Because I knew that I had to just get used to it,&rdquo; Jimin confessed. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t just drop my commitments to the group but anytime I went to work after Noah was born, I just wanted to be back here at home with him and you.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Aw Jimin-ssi,&rdquo; you cooed, reaching over and patting his cheek with your hand. &ldquo;For me, it was reliving to go back to work because I missed it. I also loved the feeling of getting to come home after a long but good day at work and getting to see not only Jimin, but this beautiful little face too,&rdquo; you grinned as you pressed a kiss to Noah&rsquo;s chubby cheek, making him squeal.</p><p><b><i>How do you manage when he&rsquo;s on tour?</i></b></p><p>&ldquo;I hate it when he has to leave,&rdquo; you blurt out, making Jimin look over at you with a frown on his face. &ldquo;Even though Noah is still young, he definitely notices when Jimin is gone and that makes him sad. In turn, I become even more upset because not only is Jimin gone, but now Noah&rsquo;s sad,&rdquo; you explain. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Jagiya,&rdquo; Jimin murmurs as he moves closer to you. He wraps an arm around your shoulder, pulling you into his side. &ldquo;I know, I hate having to leave you guys too.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I usually just try to keep myself, and Noah, occupied until he gets back. Things like taking Noah to the park, play dates with the boys&rsquo; other kids, anything really,&rdquo; you listed. &ldquo;That usually helps the time pass faster.&rdquo;</p><p><b><i>Has Noah been to the BigHit building? If so, how do you keep him occupied?</i></b></p><p>\n\n&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been a few times, the rare days where we don&rsquo;t want to send him to daycare but Y/N-ah has to go into work for a few hours so he comes with me,&rdquo; Jimin nods. &ldquo;Noah loves watching us perform so I never really struggle to keep his attention. Plus, he loves the members and our staff as well so there&rsquo;s always someone to keep him occupied if need be.&rdquo;\n\n<br /></p><p><b><i>Do you guys post lots of photos of Noah, or do you prefer to maintain some privacy when it comes to him?</i></b></p><p>&ldquo;We love posting photos of Noah,&rdquo; you answered. &ldquo;Especially these cute little photo collages comparing him to old photos of Jimin, since they look so much alike.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;While Y/N was still pregnant, we discussed how much we&rsquo;d post him and we decided that we wouldn&rsquo;t let any potential trolls stop us from posting things about our child, who we love very much and are insanely proud of,&rdquo; Jimin explained. </p><p><b><i>How do you deal with tantrums?</i></b></p><p>&ldquo;Jimin doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; you answered immediately, making him look over at you.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean? I do deal with his tantrums,&rdquo; Jimin refuted.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Giving him what he wants is not&nbsp;&lsquo;dealing with it&rsquo;,&rdquo; you chuckled.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s not my fault I have a soft spot for him,&rdquo; Jimin murmured and you rolled your eyes playfully.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Since Noah is so sweet, he doesn&rsquo;t like being yelled at so if I just gently scold him, that does the trick,&rdquo; you said.<br /></p><p><b><i>How often do you and Jimin get to spend time together?
