But life is beautiful when people grow from their experiences, and strive to be better.</p><p>Examples. Dumbledore is a common scapegoat, because damn a lot of his decisions in canon were hella sketchy. Placing Harry with the Dursleys, number one. Abuse, physical or mental, and unarguable neglect happened in that house. Especially when one considers the new stuff about Obscurials and what Dumbles knew about them, this decision is&hellip; shall we say, highly questionable. However, I still believe that Albus was simply a man who tried to do the right thing and made a mistake. Many mistakes, really. I think that he was probably really,<i> deathly</i> scared for Harry\u2019s life right after Voldy hit the wind. And he didn\u2019t know the full extent of Petunia\u2019s hatred. For all we know, his last knowledge of Petunia was that she sent a letter to him after Lily got hers, wanting to be allowed into Hogwarts. And considering that Lily\u2019s protection of Harry was powered by her love for him (or that\u2019s how Dumbles explains it), if the blood relatives he was placed with had loved him it probably would have been even more powerful. The most powerful protection ever. Dumbledore had every reason to hope like hell that Petunia\u2019s love for her sister would carry over to her son. That it didn\u2019t, and Harry was not treated well as a result, Dumbledore probably regretted to and beyond his grave. But by the time he was aware of it (we\u2019re ignoring for now Mrs. Figg and how he didn\u2019t seem to check up on Harry enough) and able to do something, Voldemort had made an appearance for the first time in a decade, and that blood protection was obviously still needed.</p><p>And I\u2019m getting off track, sorry. So I see a lot of fics where Dumbles gets bashed. Sometimes he\u2019s made out to be a lot more manipulative, and sometimes outright evil, than I think he was in canon. And I go along with it, because dang he made a lot of sketchy decisions, not just the one I mentioned before, and it is believable he could have done even more sketchy stuff. But in the ones where he\u2019s not quite evil, just misguided and Machiavellian, he almost never really gets to repent and change. Like he just keeps on doing dumb shit while the heroes of the fic do stuff behind his back and resent him, and at some point he gets yelled at for his shit. And maybe he blinks a bit at this outburst, but more often than not he then starts trying to talk down to the person yelling, like they\u2019re the dumb ones and he knows best and they should listen to him. Like he hasn\u2019t learned anything at all from the beatdown. And it just isn\u2019t as satisfying to have someone give verbal destruction to a guy who deserves it if said guy doesn\u2019t even seem to take it in, you know? I want a misguided good person, who when the heroes give them hell for all the shit they\u2019ve pulled, sits down and has a good think about what the heroes said, realizing they maybe had a point, and then feels bad about it and tries to make up for it. That would be much more satisfying.</p><p>Another example I see a lot of is in Avengers fic? Like Civil War, I hate Civil War, because many of the fix-its are on Team Tony, and that\u2019s great, I love Tony, I love Tony-centric fics, it\u2019s awesome. But here\u2019s the thing: I also love Steve. And many Tony-centric stories tend to vilify Steve. And I can handle it, especially since a lot of his actions and those of the rest of the team in canon can be interpreted as not-so-good especially where Tony\u2019s concerned. But, but but. That\u2019s not<i> who Steve is</i>. He\u2019s the guy who wants to do the right thing, who hates bullies. He\u2019d be horrified at the thought that he\u2019d turned into one. And in a lot of fics that\u2019s exactly what he is. And Tony\u2019s not 100% perfect, either. Plus there were miscommunications on both sides of that clusterfuck, which didn\u2019t help. I want a fix-it where they\u2019re both kind of right, and both kind of wrong, and the ending of Civil War in Siberia never happened because what the fuck. What the actual fuck, anyway.</p><p>So, a challenge: Bash the characters, sure. You see something they did was problematic and you want to call them out on it? Go ahead. But then have them realize and understand what they did wrong, and work to fix it. Points if you show them as complicated individuals who had valid reasonings for what they did, and were right about a couple of things even though they were wrong on a lot. Bonus points if they point out (or the hero realizes) how the hero also fucked up a bit here and there. Because people are dumb, and people are narrow-minded and petty and can get caught in circular reasoning and all sorts of things. But people can change. They grow and learn and they strive to be better in all things. And that\u2019s what makes life beautiful.</p>",

Especially when one considers the new stuff about Obscurials and what Dumbles knew about them, this decision is\u2026 shall we say, highly questionable. However, I still believe that Albus was simply a man who tried to do the right thing and made a mistake. Many mistakes, really. I think that he was probably really,<i> deathly</i> scared for Harry\u2019s life right after Voldy hit the wind. And he didn\u2019t know the full extent of Petunia\u2019s hatred. For all we know, his last knowledge of Petunia was that she sent a letter to him after Lily got hers, wanting to be allowed into Hogwarts. And considering that Lily\u2019s protection of Harry was powered by her love for him (or that\u2019s how Dumbles explains it), if the blood relatives he was placed with had loved him it probably would have been even more powerful. The most powerful protection ever. Dumbledore had every reason to hope like hell that Petunia\u2019s love for her sister would carry over to her son. That it didn\u2019t, and Harry was not treated well as a result, Dumbledore probably regretted to and beyond his grave. But by the time he was aware of it (we\u2019re ignoring for now Mrs. Figg and how he didn\u2019t seem to check up on Harry enough) and able to do something, Voldemort had made an appearance for the first time in a decade, and that blood protection was obviously still needed.</p><p>And I\u2019m getting off track, sorry. So I see a lot of fics where Dumbles gets bashed. Sometimes he\u2019s made out to be a lot more manipulative, and sometimes outright evil, than I think he was in canon. And I go along with it, because dang he made a lot of sketchy decisions, not just the one I mentioned before, and it is believable he could have done even more sketchy stuff. But in the ones where he\u2019s not quite evil, just misguided and Machiavellian, he almost never really gets to repent and change. Like he just keeps on doing dumb shit while the heroes of the fic do stuff behind his back and resent him, and at some point he gets yelled at for his shit. And maybe he blinks a bit at this outburst, but more often than not he then starts trying to talk down to the person yelling, like they\u2019re the dumb ones and he knows best and they should listen to him. Like he hasn\u2019t learned anything at all from the beatdown. And it just isn\u2019t as satisfying to have someone give verbal destruction to a guy who deserves it if said guy doesn\u2019t even seem to take it in, you know? I want a misguided good person, who when the heroes give them hell for all the shit they\u2019ve pulled, sits down and has a good think about what the heroes said, realizing they maybe had a point, and then feels bad about it and tries to make up for it. That would be much more satisfying.</p><p>Another example I see a lot of is in Avengers fic? Like Civil War, I hate Civil War, because many of the fix-its are on Team Tony, and that\u2019s great, I love Tony, I love Tony-centric fics, it\u2019s awesome. But here\u2019s the thing: I also love Steve. And many Tony-centric stories tend to vilify Steve. And I can handle it, especially since a lot of his actions and those of the rest of the team in canon can be interpreted as not-so-good especially where Tony\u2019s concerned. But, but but.

And in a lot of fics that\u2019s exactly what he is. And Tony\u2019s not 100% perfect, either. Plus there were miscommunications on both sides of that clusterfuck, which didn\u2019t help. I want a fix-it where they\u2019re both kind of right, and both kind of wrong, and the ending of Civil War in Siberia never happened because what the fuck. What the actual fuck, anyway.</p><p>So, a challenge: Bash the characters, sure. You see something they did was problematic and you want to call them out on it? Go ahead. But then have them realize and understand what they did wrong, and work to fix it. Points if you show them as complicated individuals who had valid reasonings for what they did, and were right about a couple of things even though they were wrong on a lot. Bonus points if they point out (or the hero realizes) how the hero also fucked up a bit here and there. Because people are dumb, and people are narrow-minded and petty and can get caught in circular reasoning and all sorts of things. But people can change. They grow and learn and they strive to be better in all things. And that\u2019s what makes life beautiful.</p>",
