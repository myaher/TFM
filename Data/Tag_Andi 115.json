The other team stared in awe as TJ sunk another three-pointer. He had no idea where all this energy was coming from, but this was hands down the best TJ had ever played. With six seconds left on the clock and a twelve point lead, TJ stole the ball from the opposing team and shot his final shot at the three-point line.<b><br/></b></p><p>SWISH!</p><p>The buzzer goes off as the ball falls through the hoop. His team surrounds him, clapping him on the back as he releases the breath he didn\u2019t realize he was holding. He shakes the other players&rsquo; hands and walks over to the bench to grab his stuff. The coach compliments him and informs them that there would be no practice tomorrow in honor of the win. Finally, TJ turns towards the stands to search for Cyrus, but he\u2019s already standing in front of him, giving him a giant smile and holding one of his signature signs.</p><p>\u201cThat was awesome, Teej\u201d, the younger boy exclaimed, hugging him fiercely. Even though he had just played what felt like the longest game of his life, TJ was invigorated by his crush\u2019s touch and eagerly returned the embrace.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Underdog\u201d, the basketball player replied as the pair broke apart. \u201cI\u2019m going to go change. Meet you outside in a bit?\u201d The brunet nodded and TJ headed off towards the locker room.</p><p>The rest of the team was already in there and cheers went up when TJ came in. They all offered forms of congratulations as he went down the isles to his locker. James, the shooting guard now that Buffy had her own team, leaned up against his locker, already changed, when he saw TJ walking up.</p><p>\u201cG.G. Kippen\u201d, he said watching TJ fiddle with his locker combination.</p><p>\u201cThanks\u201d, he responded as his locker swung open, glancing slightly at the other boy. \u201cYou, too.\u201d</p><p>James was silent for a minute before he said, \u201cYou know your friend that\u2019s always with you? The one you beat up Alex for when he said stuff about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d, TJ answered tensing. He remembered vividly what he had beaten up the school\u2019s football star for.</p><p>\u201cThe other team\u2019s captain kept looking at him. He kept getting distracted whenever he would cheer or anything.\u201d TJ took a second to digest this information before turning toward the other boy. James was watching the captain, trying to gauge his reaction. \u201cJust thought you should know\u201d, the boy added.<b><br/></b></p><p>TJ nodded and thanked him before heading to the showers, the information he had just learned occupying all of his thoughts.<i> There were plenty of reasons why he could\u2019ve been looking at Cyrus</i>, he thought, <i>he is pretty loud when it comes to cheering</i>. But TJ knew the only reason why the other captain would be so distracted by Cyrus would be the same reasons <b>he\u2019s</b> usually distracted by Cyrus. Because Cyrus is cute and he\u2019s a raging homosexual.</p><p>TJ was showered and changed in ten minutes. He left the locker room at a quicker pace than normal. He pretended that it was to make sure Cyrus didn\u2019t have to wait long, but he knew the main reason was to make sure the other captain didn\u2019t try anything. Like asking him out in a polite and pleasant way. But when he reached the hall, he realized he was too late. Cyrus and the other player stood talking at the end of the corridor. The other team probably should&rsquo;ve left already, but apparently, cute, quirky boys were a good reason to delay the trip back.</p><p>TJ slowly walked up to the pair, trying to act nonchalant, an expression he\u2019d gotten pretty good at over the years of terrifying everyone in a thousand-foot radius. Except for Cyrus. And small children. And animals, surprisingly. Oh, and don\u2019t forget his used-to-be nemesis, Buffy Driscoll. Plus, his sister. Oh, and-</p><p>\u201cTeej!\u201d, Cyrus excited call broke through the boy\u2019s train of thought. TJ beamed at the smaller boy and was pleasantly surprised when Cyrus rushed over to him, leaving the other captain looking rather disappointed.</p><p>\u201cHey, Cy. Ready to go?\u201d, TJ asked as he glanced at the other boy watching them. Before, the brown-eyed boy could answer, however, another voice interjected.</p><p>\u201cGood game, Kippen\u201d, the other captain said coming up to the two friends. The boy was about TJ\u2019s height, but a bit skinnier, with brown hair and blue eyes freckles dotting his face. He was cute, in TJ\u2019s professional gay opinion. Probably Cyrus\u2019s type.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Marias\u201d, the boy\u2019s last name coming back to TJ. \u201cSame for you.\u201d Marais gave TJ a look. They both knew he hadn\u2019t been playing his best. And they both knew the reason why.\u00a0They tried to stare each other down for a bit before Marais turned toward the smaller boy who was looking between the two players.</p><p>\u201cIt was nice meeting you Cyrus\u201d, he said.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus smiled, \u201cIt was nice meeting you, too.\u201d</p><p>The other captain nodded, realizing he had lost his chance at the boy as soon as TJ walked up. He nodded at TJ in one final acknowledgment before heading off, presumably towards his bus. The pair watched him leave before turning back toward each other. Now that he and Cyrus were alone, TJ visibly relaxed. He gave Cyrus a big smile before throwing his arm over the brunet\u2019s shoulders.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo, milkshakes at the spoon?\u201d, he asked. Cyrus beamed and nodded his head as they walked out of the school together.</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>When they were happily situated on their respective sides of a booth and had their customary basket of baby taters and milkshakes, TJ decided to address the thing that had been eating at him.</p><p>\u201cSo\u201d, he began, stretching out and leaning back to make it seem like he wasn\u2019t that interested. \u201cWhat did Marais want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he asked me out\u201d, Cyrus answered, nonchalantly. If TJ had been drinking his milkshake, he would\u2019ve choked.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d, he asked in a strained voice.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he came up to me and said I was cute, and then he asked me out. What is it so strange that someone would want to go out with me?\u201d, Cyrus said.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sure there are plenty of guys who want to ask you out\u201d, TJ responded honestly. <i>Me included</i>, he thought. \u201cIt\u2019s just&ndash;you didn\u2019t say anything about going out with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. I said \u2018no\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did? Why?\u201d, TJ blanched.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like him like that. I like someone else\u201d, Cyrus said, slightly nervous.<b><br/></b></p><p>\u201cOh\u201d, TJ replied, disappointed once again. \u201cWho\u2019s the lucky guy?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus was quiet for a minute before taking a deep breath and looking up at TJ. \u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>TJ sat shock still for a minute before his face broke out into the biggest smile his face could physically conjure up. \u201cMe?\u201d, he asked. Cyrus nodded, a small smile growing on his face. At this, TJ slid over to the other side of the booth and cupping the smaller boys face in his hands. He closed the distance between them and placed a soft kiss on the boy\u2019s lips. When they pulled apart, they both wore huge grins.</p><p>\u201cSo, am I the person <b>you</b> like?\u201d, Cyrus asked, teasing.</p><p>But TJ just nodded and seriously said, \u201cIt\u2019s always been you, Underdog.\u201d At this, Cyrus pulled him back into another small kiss.</p><p>The next time they played that team, Jefferson won 47-5. TJ celebrated by kissing his boyfriend. \u00a0</p>",

The other team stared in awe as TJ sunk another three-pointer. He had no idea where all this energy was coming from, but this was hands down the best TJ had ever played. With six seconds left on the clock and a twelve point lead, TJ stole the ball from the opposing team and shot his final shot at the three-point line.<b><br></b></p><p>SWISH!</p><p>The buzzer goes off as the ball falls through the hoop. His team surrounds him, clapping him on the back as he releases the breath he didn\u2019t realize he was holding. He shakes the other players\u2019 hands and walks over to the bench to grab his stuff. The coach compliments him and informs them that there would be no practice tomorrow in honor of the win. Finally, TJ turns towards the stands to search for Cyrus, but he\u2019s already standing in front of him, giving him a giant smile and holding one of his signature signs.</p><p>\u201cThat was awesome, Teej\u201d, the younger boy exclaimed, hugging him fiercely. Even though he had just played what felt like the longest game of his life, TJ was invigorated by his crush\u2019s touch and eagerly returned the embrace.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Underdog\u201d, the basketball player replied as the pair broke apart. \u201cI\u2019m going to go change. Meet you outside in a bit?\u201d The brunet nodded and TJ headed off towards the locker room.</p><p>The rest of the team was already in there and cheers went up when TJ came in. They all offered forms of congratulations as he went down the isles to his locker. James, the shooting guard now that Buffy had her own team, leaned up against his locker, already changed, when he saw TJ walking up.</p><p>\u201cG.G. Kippen\u201d, he said watching TJ fiddle with his locker combination.</p><p>\u201cThanks\u201d, he responded as his locker swung open, glancing slightly at the other boy. \u201cYou, too.\u201d</p><p>James was silent for a minute before he said, \u201cYou know your friend that\u2019s always with you? The one you beat up Alex for when he said stuff about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d, TJ answered tensing. He remembered vividly what he had beaten up the school\u2019s football star for.</p><p>\u201cThe other team\u2019s captain kept looking at him. He kept getting distracted whenever he would cheer or anything.\u201d TJ took a second to digest this information before turning toward the other boy. James was watching the captain, trying to gauge his reaction. \u201cJust thought you should know\u201d, the boy added.<b><br></b></p><p>TJ nodded and thanked him before heading to the showers, the information he had just learned occupying all of his thoughts.<i> There were plenty of reasons why he could\u2019ve been looking at Cyrus</i>, he thought, <i>he is pretty loud when it comes to cheering</i>. But TJ knew the only reason why the other captain would be so distracted by Cyrus would be the same reasons <b>he\u2019s</b> usually distracted by Cyrus. Because Cyrus is cute and he\u2019s a raging homosexual.</p><p>TJ was showered and changed in ten minutes. He left the locker room at a quicker pace than normal. He pretended that it was to make sure Cyrus didn\u2019t have to wait long, but he knew the main reason was to make sure the other captain didn\u2019t try anything. Like asking him out in a polite and pleasant way. But when he reached the hall, he realized he was too late. Cyrus and the other player stood talking at the end of the corridor. The other team probably should\u2019ve left already, but apparently, cute, quirky boys were a good reason to delay the trip back.</p><p>TJ slowly walked up to the pair, trying to act nonchalant, an expression he\u2019d gotten pretty good at over the years of terrifying everyone in a thousand-foot radius. Except for Cyrus. And small children. And animals, surprisingly. Oh, and don\u2019t forget his used-to-be nemesis, Buffy Driscoll. Plus, his sister. Oh, and-</p><p>\u201cTeej!\u201d, Cyrus excited call broke through the boy\u2019s train of thought. TJ beamed at the smaller boy and was pleasantly surprised when Cyrus rushed over to him, leaving the other captain looking rather disappointed.</p><p>\u201cHey, Cy. Ready to go?\u201d, TJ asked as he glanced at the other boy watching them. Before, the brown-eyed boy could answer, however, another voice interjected.</p><p>\u201cGood game, Kippen\u201d, the other captain said coming up to the two friends. The boy was about TJ\u2019s height, but a bit skinnier, with brown hair and blue eyes freckles dotting his face. He was cute, in TJ\u2019s professional gay opinion. Probably Cyrus\u2019s type.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Marias\u201d, the boy\u2019s last name coming back to TJ. \u201cSame for you.\u201d Marais gave TJ a look. They both knew he hadn\u2019t been playing his best. And they both knew the reason why.\u00a0They tried to stare each other down for a bit before Marais turned toward the smaller boy who was looking between the two players.</p><p>\u201cIt was nice meeting you Cyrus\u201d, he said.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus smiled, \u201cIt was nice meeting you, too.\u201d</p><p>The other captain nodded, realizing he had lost his chance at the boy as soon as TJ walked up. He nodded at TJ in one final acknowledgment before heading off, presumably towards his bus. The pair watched him leave before turning back toward each other. Now that he and Cyrus were alone, TJ visibly relaxed. He gave Cyrus a big smile before throwing his arm over the brunet\u2019s shoulders.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo, milkshakes at the spoon?\u201d, he asked. Cyrus beamed and nodded his head as they walked out of the school together.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>When they were happily situated on their respective sides of a booth and had their customary basket of baby taters and milkshakes, TJ decided to address the thing that had been eating at him.</p><p>\u201cSo\u201d, he began, stretching out and leaning back to make it seem like he wasn\u2019t that interested. \u201cWhat did Marais want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he asked me out\u201d, Cyrus answered, nonchalantly. If TJ had been drinking his milkshake, he would\u2019ve choked.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d, he asked in a strained voice.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he came up to me and said I was cute, and then he asked me out. What is it so strange that someone would want to go out with me?\u201d, Cyrus said.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sure there are plenty of guys who want to ask you out\u201d, TJ responded honestly. <i>Me included</i>, he thought. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2013you didn\u2019t say anything about going out with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. I said \u2018no\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did? Why?\u201d, TJ blanched.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like him like that. I like someone else\u201d, Cyrus said, slightly nervous.<b><br></b></p><p>\u201cOh\u201d, TJ replied, disappointed once again. \u201cWho\u2019s the lucky guy?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus was quiet for a minute before taking a deep breath and looking up at TJ. \u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>TJ sat shock still for a minute before his face broke out into the biggest smile his face could physically conjure up. \u201cMe?\u201d, he asked. Cyrus nodded, a small smile growing on his face. At this, TJ slid over to the other side of the booth and cupping the smaller boys face in his hands. He closed the distance between them and placed a soft kiss on the boy\u2019s lips. When they pulled apart, they both wore huge grins.</p><p>\u201cSo, am I the person <b>you</b> like?\u201d, Cyrus asked, teasing.</p><p>But TJ just nodded and seriously said, \u201cIt\u2019s always been you, Underdog.\u201d At this, Cyrus pulled him back into another small kiss.</p><p>The next time they played that team, Jefferson won 47-5. TJ celebrated by kissing his boyfriend. \u00a0</p>",
