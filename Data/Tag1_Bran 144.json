Harry Potter: I will live and die a Ravenclaw who always thought she was a Gryffindor. Doctor Who: David Tennant will always be my Doctor. The Walking Dead: Caryl shipper and proud. Tolkien: a thousand times yes. Jane Austen: always a favorite. Photography. Music. History: primarily the history of the Wild West, especially Deadwood and Tombstone. I'm given to flights of fancy, occasionally going off the deep end. Depression and anxiety are real, don't let anyone tell you otherwise; after all, they kept me from living for the longest time. Talk to me, ask me anything.

But then I came across <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sansannister/status/1091864822864637953\" target=\"_blank\">another post</a>, which postulated that the Mountain/Robert Strong will be the one to kill Cersei as Jaime leaving her with him parallels Rhaella leaving Aerys II with Jaime.\u00a0</p><p>But if valonqar means \u201clittle brother\u201d, Gregor\u00a0\u201cthe Hound\u201d Clegane is the older brother to Sandor\u00a0\u201cthe Hound\u201d Clegane. Bran, however, is still Sansa\u2019s younger brother, who all the Lannisters have some sort of relationship with - directly or indirectly. There\u2019s also a lot of \u201cmonster\u201d imagery attached to the valonqar and being a cripple, Bran would fit the subversion of the notion.\u00a0</p><h2><b>The Three Shadows</b></h2><p>From the books and show we know that he could warg into a human or a more difficult being from his experience with Hodor, who was also incidentally considered a giant. But more than that, there is a certain instance in AGOT, that has the most crucial evidence for this theory.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>He looked south, and saw the great blue-green rush of the Trident. He saw his father pleading with the king, his face etched with grief. </i>He saw Sansa crying herself to sleep at night, and he saw Arya watching in silence and holding her secrets hard in her heart. <b>There were shadows all around them. </b><i><b>One shadow was dark as ash, with the terrible face of a hound. Another was armored like the sun, golden and beautiful. Over them both loomed a giant in armor made of stone, but when he opened his visor, there was nothing inside but darkness and thick black blood.</b></i>\u201d - Bran III, AGOT<br/></p><!-- more --><p>The first shadow\u00a0\u201cwith a terrible face of a hound\u201d is obviously the Hound and the second\u00a0\u201carmored like the sun, golden and beautiful\u201d is likely to be Jaime. But considering, Jaime threw Bran off a tower, it could be Brienne, who has blonde hair, is called\u00a0\u201cthe Beauty\u201d and whose House sigil bears a sun and moon. That\u2019s not enough grounds to dismiss Jaime as the vision has no sign of a moon, and the Hound and Jaime are juxtaposed against each other in their appearances playing on the Beauty and the Beast aspect.\u00a0</p><p>Moreover, in the same chapter Jaime\u2019s face is described as\u00a0\u201cshining with light\u201d and\u00a0\u201cgolden\u201d.\u00a0</p><p><i>Bran was staring at his arms, his legs. He was so skinny, just skin stretched taut over bones. Had he always been so thin? He tried to remember. <b>A face swam up at him out of the grey mist, shining with light, golden. &ldquo;The things I do for love,&rdquo; it said.</b></i></p><p><i>Bran screamed.<br/></i></p><p><i>The crow took to the air, cawing. Not that, it shrieked at him. Forget that, you do not need it now, put it aside, put it away. It landed on Bran&rsquo;s shoulder, and pecked at him, and <b>the shining golden face was gone</b>. </i>- Bran III, AGOT<br/></p><p>&ldquo;<i>No harm will come to me today,&rdquo; Cersei said when the day&rsquo;s first light brushed her window. &ldquo;Only my pride will suffer.&rdquo; The words rang hollow in her ears. Jaime may yet come. <b>She pictured him riding through the morning mists, his golden armor bright in the light of the rising sun.</b></i>\u201d\u00a0- Cersei II, ADWD<br/></p><p>Brienne also wasn\u2019t introduced until ACOK, so it\u2019s most likely to be Jaime.\u00a0</p><p>And the third sounds a lot like the Mountain being resurrected as Robert Strong.\u00a0</p><p><i>&ldquo;Ser Gregor.&rdquo; Qyburn shrugged. &ldquo;I have examined him, as you commanded. The poison on the Viper&rsquo;s spear was <b>manticore venom from the east</b>, I would stake my life on that.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Pycelle says no. He told my lord father that manticore venom kills the instant it reaches the heart.&rdquo;<br/></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;And so it does. <b>But this venom has been thickened somehow</b>, so as to draw out the Mountain&rsquo;s dying.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Thickened? Thickened how? With some other substance?&rdquo;</i><br/></p><p><i>&ldquo;It may be as Your Grace suggests, though in most cases adulterating a poison only lessens its potency. It may be that the cause is &hellip; less natural, let us say. A spell, I think.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Is this one as big a fool as Pycelle? &ldquo;<b>So are you telling me that the Mountain is dying of some black sorcery?</b></i><i>&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Qyburn ignored the mockery in her voice. &ldquo;He is dying of the venom, but slowly, and in exquisite agony. My efforts to ease his pain have proved as fruitless as Pycelle&rsquo;s. Ser Gregor is overly accustomed to the poppy, I fear. His squire tells me that he is plagued by blinding headaches and oft quaffs the milk of the poppy as lesser men quaff ale. <b>Be that as it may, his veins have turned black from head to heel,</b> his water is clouded with pus, and the venom has eaten a hole in his side as large as my fist. It is a wonder that the man is still alive, if truth be told.&rdquo;</i>\u00a0</p><p>- Cersei II, AFFC<br/></p><p><i>&ldquo;If that is Your Grace&rsquo;s wish,&rdquo; Qyburn said, &ldquo;but this poison &hellip; it would be useful to know more about it, would it not? <b>Send a knight to slay a knight and an archer to kill an archer, the smallfolk often say. To combat the black arts &hellip;</b>&quot;\u00a0He did not finish the thought, but only smiled at her.</i></p><p><i>He is not Pycelle, that much is plain. The queen weighed him, wondering. &quot;Why did the Citadel take your chain?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;The archmaesters are all craven at heart. The grey sheep, Marwyn calls them. I was as skilled a healer as Ebrose, but aspired to surpass him. For hundreds of years the men of the Citadel have opened the bodies of the dead, to study the nature of life. I wished to understand the nature of death, so I opened the bodies of the living. For that crime the grey sheep shamed me and forced me into exile &hellip; <b>but I understand the nature of life and death better than any man in Oldtown</b>.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; That intrigued her. &ldquo;Very well. The Mountain is yours. Do what you will with him, but confine your studies to the black cells. <b>When he dies, bring me his head. My father promised it to Dorne. </b>Prince Doran would no doubt prefer to kill Gregor himself, but we all must suffer disappointments in this life.&rdquo;</i><br/></p><p>- Cersei II, AFFC</p><p>His veins have turned black and thickened due to the manticore venom, and he is resurrected by the dark arts. But also Qyburn has his head delivered to Dorne. This would fit Bran\u2019s vision of the empty visor and\u00a0\u201cnothing inside but darkness and black blood\u201d.\u00a0</p><p><i>Cersei never saw where Qyburn came from, but suddenly he was there beside them, scrambling to keep up with her champion&rsquo;s long strides. &ldquo;Your Grace,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is so good to have you back. <b>May I have the honor of presenting our newest member of the Kingsguard? This is Ser Robert Strong.</b>&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Ser Robert,&rdquo; Cersei whispered, as they entered the gates.<br/></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;If it please Your Grace, Ser Robert has taken a holy vow of silence,&rdquo; Qyburn said. &ldquo;He has sworn that he will not speak until all of His Grace&rsquo;s enemies are dead and evil has been driven from the realm<b>.</b>&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Yes, thought Cersei Lannister. Oh, yes.\u00a0</i></p><p>- Cersei II, ADWD<br/></p><p>On westeros.org, <a href=\"https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/Prophecies/Entry/1791/\" target=\"_blank\">the Citadel</a>\u00a0theorises the same identities for these three shadows.\u00a0If these three shadows are in fact the Hound, Jaime and Robert Strong, they all have served Cersei and House Lannister at some point and were part of the kingsguard. As two deserted her and have started to build an association with the Stark girls directly or indirectly, it is possible for the third to go against her as well. But as he\u2019s a zombie and as Bran\u2019s vision depicts his visor being empty, it\u2019s likely that he would be controlled by someone else and Bran has done this before with with a\u00a0\u201csimpleminded giant\u201d Hodor.\u00a0\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ac2be92c432b1f1e9db6134b873db8e4/tumblr_inline_pmd2tsvKAn1u48vsz_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"/></figure><p><i>Lightning slashed the sky, and Hodor whimpered. Then a clap of thunder rolled across the lake. &ldquo;HODOR!&rdquo; he roared, clapping his hands over his ears and stumbling in a circle through the darkness. &ldquo;HODOR! HODOR! HODOR!&rdquo;&ldquo;NO!&quot;\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Bran shouted back. &quot;NO HODORING!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>It did no good. &ldquo;HOOOODOR!&rdquo; moaned Hodor. Meera tried to catch him and calm him, but he was too strong. He flung her aside with no more than a shrug. &ldquo;HOOOOOODOOOOOOOR!&rdquo; the stableboy screamed as lightning filled the sky again, and even Jojen was shouting now, shouting at Bran and Meera to shut him up.<br/></i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Be quiet!&rdquo; Bran said in a shrill scared voice, reaching up uselessly for Hodor&rsquo;s leg as he crashed past, reaching, reaching.</b></i></p><p><i><b>Hodor staggered, and closed his mouth. He shook his head slowly from side to side, sank back to the floor, and sat crosslegged. When the thunder boomed, he scarcely seemed to hear it. </b>The four of them sat in the dark tower, scarce daring to breathe.</i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Bran, what did you do?&rdquo; Meera whispered.</b><br/></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; Bran shook his head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; <b>But he did. I reached for him, the way I reach for Summer. He had been Hodor for half a heartbeat</b>. It scared him.\u00a0</i></p><p>- Bran III, ASOS<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>I can&rsquo;t let her fight the thing alone, he thought. <b>Summer was far away, but . .\u00a0.</b></i></p><p><i><b>&hellip; he slipped his skin, and reached for Hodor.</b></i></p><p><i><b>It was not like sliding into Summer. </b>That was so easy now that Bran hardly thought about it. <b>This was harder, like trying to pull a left boot on your right foot. It fit all wrong, </b>and the boot was scared too, t<b>he boot didn&rsquo;t know what was happening, the boot was pushing the foot away. </b>He tasted vomit in the back of Hodor&rsquo;s throat, and that was almost enough to make him flee. <b>Instead he squirmed and shoved, sat up, gathered his legs under him\u2014his huge strong legs\u2014and rose. I&rsquo;m standing. He took a step. I&rsquo;m walking.</b> It was such a strange feeling that he almost fell. He could see himself on the cold stone floor, a little broken thing, but he wasn&rsquo;t broken now. He grabbed Hodor&rsquo;s longsword. The breathing was as loud as a blacksmith&rsquo;s bellows.</i>\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Bran IV, ASOS<br/></p><p>It would make sense because the story started with Bran being crippled by the Lannisters after witnessing Jaime and Cersei\u2019s incest A lot of readers forget this because of Jaime\u2019s vow to Catelyn to protect her daughters. But to bring it up would be a reminder to Cersei (and Jaime) of the young life they broke.\u00a0</p><p><i> Far above him, outlined against a vast pale moon, he thought he could see the shapes of gargoyles. His arms were sore and aching, but he dared not rest. He forced himself to climb faster. The gargoyles watched him ascend. <b>Their eyes glowed red as hot coals in a brazier. Perhaps once they had been lions, but now they were twisted and grotesque.</b> Bran could hear them whispering to each other in soft stone voices terrible to hear.<b> He must not listen, he told himself, he must not hear, so long as he did not hear them he was safe.</b> But when the gargoyles pulled themselves loose from the stone and padded down the side of the tower to where Bran clung, he knew he was not safe after all. <b>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear,&rdquo; he wept as they came closer and closer, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t, I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>He woke gasping, <b>lost in darkness, and saw a vast shadow looming over him.</b> &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear,&rdquo; he whispered, trembling in fear, but <b>then the shadow said &ldquo;Hodor,&rdquo; and lit the candle by the bedside, and Bran sighed with relief.</b> </i>- Bran IV, AGOT<br/></p><p>Why is so much emphasis put on Bran trying to block out the truth over the series even after other characters suspect the relationship between Jaime and Cersei? This is a tactic that Sansa uses. Adding on the presence of Hodor, who Bran often describes as a\u00a0\u201csimpleminded giant\u201d, I believe this truth will count towards the end of the story in relation to his own personal arc.\u00a0</p><h2><b>Maggy the Frog\u2019s Prophecy</b></h2><p>To examine how possible it is, we have to look back at Cersei\u2019s prophecy.\u00a0</p><p><i>Malice gleamed in Maggy&rsquo;s yellow eyes. &ldquo;<b>Queen you shall be &hellip; until there comes another, younger and more beautiful, to cast you down and take all that you hold dear.</b>&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Anger flashed across the child&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;If she tries I will have my brother kill her.&rdquo;<b> </b>Even then she would not stop, willful child as she was. She still had one more question due her, one more glimpse into her life to come. &ldquo;Will the king and I have children?&rdquo; she asked.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Oh, aye. Six-and-ten for him, and three for you. [&hellip;] </i><i>Gold shall be their crowns and gold their shrouds,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;<b>And when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you</b>.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;<b>What is a valonqar? Some monster?</b>&rdquo; The golden girl did not like that foretelling.</i> - Cersei VIII, AFFC</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Tyrion is the valonqar,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Do you use that word in Myr? <b>It&rsquo;s High Valyrian, it means little brother</b>.&rdquo; She had asked Septa Saranella about the word, after Melara drowned.</i></p><p><i>Taena took her hand and stroked it. &ldquo;<b>This was a hateful woman, old and sick and ugly. You were young and beautiful, full of life and pride.</b> She lived in Lannisport, you said, so she would have known of the dwarf and how he killed your lady mother. This creature dared not strike you, because of who you were, so she sought to wound you with her viper&rsquo;s tongue.</i>&rdquo; - Cersei IX, AFFC</p><p>Cersei thinks it\u2019s about Tyrion and resents him from the get go because he looks so ugly. Given GRRM\u2019s patterns, the audience thinks it will be Jaime because he was born a few seconds after her. But they overlook that she underestimates the people that surround her and her lack of respect and love for them and the collateral damage she creates in her wake.\u00a0</p><p>It could be the Hound but the act of choking implies a kind of personal anger at the person, like Tyrion strangling Shae to death.\u00a0</p><p>It could be Arya using the Strangler poison used on Joffrey, but she already has her on her list and Arya\u2019s journey is meant to push her towards walking away from her coping mechanism of revenge as justice.\u00a0</p><p>What the audience doesn\u2019t think about is Bran. It\u2019s noteworthy that Cersei doesn\u2019t think of him either in her walk of shame even when she sees Tywin, Melara, Ned, Sansa, Lady, Tyrion and Joffrey.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cThe queen began to see familiar faces. A bald man with bushy side-whiskers frowned down from a window with her father&rsquo;s frown, and <b>for an instant looked so much like Lord Tywin</b> that she stumbled. A young girl sat beneath a fountain, drenched in spray, and stared at her with <b>Melara Hetherspoon&rsquo;s accusing eyes</b>. She saw <b>Ned Stark, and beside him little Sansa with her auburn hair and a shaggy grey dog that might have been her wolf</b>. Every child squirming through the crowd became <b>her brother Tyrion</b>, jeering at her as he had jeered when Joffrey died. And <b>there was Joff as well, her son</b>, her firstborn, her beautiful bright boy with his golden curls and his sweet smile, he had such lovely lips, he \u2026</i>\u201d - Cersei II, ADWD<br/></p><p>To her credit, Cersei didn\u2019t want Jaime to push him off the First Keep. But she did want Jaime to hunt down Arya and kill her after she set Nymeria on Joffrey. If Bran spoke up, I doubt that she would hesitate. It\u2019s also worth noting that Cersei still sees Ned beside Sansa and Lady, who she wanted to spare if he lied about being a traitor and took the black. It\u2019s Joffrey that went against all their plans the last minute. So not seeing Bran here makes his absence stick out jarringly.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>She also doesn\u2019t regret how she treated Tyrion or Sansa or the people around her. She doesn\u2019t recognise her and her family\u2019s abuse but rather sees it as a kindness because she could\u2019ve treated her worse as her hostage.\u00a0</p><p><i>&ldquo;Your Grace has forgotten the Lady Sansa,&rdquo; said Pycelle.The queen bristled.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I most certainly have not forgotten that little she-wolf.&rdquo; She refused to say the girl&rsquo;s name. &ldquo;I ought to have shown her to the black cells as the daughter of a traitor, but instead I made her part of mine own household. She shared my hearth and hall, played with my own children. <b>I fed her, dressed her, tried to make her a little less ignorant about the world, and how did she repay me for my kindness? </b>She helped murder my son. When we find the Imp, we will find the Lady Sansa too. <b>She is not dead &hellip; but before I am done with her, I promise you, she will be singing to the Stranger, begging for his kiss</b>.&rdquo;</i> - Cersei IV, AFFC<br/></p><p>\u00a0She only had love for her children, her father and Jaime. She loses all of them and drives even Jaime away. So it makes sense that the last knight and champion she has will turn against her as well. But as said, he is the Hound\u2019s older brother.\u00a0</p><p>If Bran were to pull off this act, it would be the darkest one he has done so far as it would require choking her with two hands. I don\u2019t think Bran would do it merely for revenge though. The desire to protect might push him and considering Sansa is the one who developed the longest relationship with Cersei, it may be about her.\u00a0</p><h2><b>Monsters and Knights</b></h2><p>It\u2019s worth noting that Cersei also seems to relate the valonqar to a monster and she often describes Tyrion as \u201ctwisted little brother\u201d or \u201ctwisted little monsters\u201d.\u00a0</p><p><i>&ldquo;<b>And when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you</b>.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;<b>What is a valonqar? Some monster?</b>&rdquo; The golden girl did not like that foretelling.</i>\u00a0- Cersei VIII, AFFC</p><p> \u201c<i>I am dreaming still, Cersei thought. I have not woken, nor has my nightmare ended. Tyrion will creep out from under the bed soon and begin to laugh at me. But that was folly. Her dwarf brother was down in the black cells, condemned to die this very day. She looked down at her hands, turning them over to make certain all her fingers were still there. When she ran a hand down her arm the skin was covered with gooseprickles, but unbroken. There were no cuts on her legs, no gashes on the soles of her feet. A dream, that&rsquo;s all it was, a dream. I drank too much last night, these fears are only humors born of wine. I will be the one laughing, come dusk. My children will be safe, Tommen&rsquo;s throne will be secure, and <b>my twisted little valonqar will be short a head and rotting</b>.</i>\u201d - Cersei I, AFFC</p><p>\u201c<i>She had never truly believed that he was harboring the Imp. Her <b>twisted little brother</b> was too clever to allow Lollys to name her wretched ill-begotten bastard after him, knowing it was sure to draw the queen&rsquo;s wroth down upon her.</i>\u201d - Cersei VII, AFFC<br/></p><p><i>Cersei had never realized there were so many dwarfs. &ldquo;Is the whole world overrun with these <b>twisted little monsters</b>?&rdquo; she complained, whilst the last of the informers was being ushered out. &ldquo;How many of them can there be?&rdquo;</i> - Cersei VIII, AFFC<br/></p><p>Bran is also \u201clittle\u201d given his age and the fact that he cannot walk. The word \u201ctwisted\u201d is also used for Winterfell Bran and the heart tree. The roots of the heart tree are even described as \u201ca man\u2019s gnarled arms\u201d or\u00a0\u201cas thick as a giant\u2019s legs\u201d. This matters because Bran is often related to trees.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>To a boy, Winterfell was a grey stone labyrinth of walls and towers and courtyards and tunnels spreading out in all directions. In the older parts of the castle, the halls slanted up and down so that you couldn&rsquo;t even be sure what floor you were on. The place had grown over the centuries like <b>some monstrous stone tree</b>, Maester Luwin told him once, and <b>its branches were gnarled and thick and twisted, its roots sunk deep into the earth</b>.</i>\u201d - Bran II, AGOT</p><p><i>\u201c<b>The roots were everywhere, twisting through earth and stone,</b> closing off some passages and holding up the roofs of others. All the color is gone, Bran realized suddenly. The world was black soil and white wood. <b>The heart tree at Winterfell had roots as thick around as a giant&rsquo;s legs</b>, but these were even thicker. And Bran had never seen so many of them. There must be a whole grove of weirwoods growing up above us</i>.\u201d - Bran II, ADWD<br/></p><p><i>\u201cLord Eddard Stark sat upon a rock beside the deep black pool in the godswood, the pale <b>roots of the heart tree twisting around him like an old man&rsquo;s gnarled arms</b>.</i>\u201d - Bran III, ADWD<br/></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Your brother Jon asked it of me. And I have a tender spot in my heart for <b>cripples and bastards and broken things</b>.</i>&rdquo; Tyrion Lannister placed a hand over his heart and grinned. - Bran IV, AGOT<br/></p><p>So there\u2019s a connection with the heart tree\u2019s immovable but twisted roots and Bran\u2019s lower limbs. There\u2019s also the fact that even Willas is described as\u00a0\u201ctwisted\u201d for having a bad leg.\u00a0</p><p><i>&ldquo;My son Willas is an able lad,&rdquo; the man replied, refusing to take her perfectly good hint. &ldquo;<b>His leg may be twisted</b> but he has no want of wits.\u201d</i> - Cersei II, AFFC<br/></p><p>Bran is in turn caught in a dilemma of wanting to be a knight while people see him as \u201cbroken\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>Harrion Karstark, the oldest of Lord Rickard&rsquo;s sons, bowed, and his brothers after him, yet as they settled back in their places he heard the younger two talking in low voices, over the clatter of wine cups. &quot;\u2026 sooner die than live like that,&rdquo; muttered one, his father&rsquo;s namesake Eddard, and his brother Torrhen said likely <b>the boy was broken inside as well as out,</b> too craven to take his own life.</i></p><p><i><b>Broken, Bran thought bitterly as he clutched his knife. Is that what he was now? Bran the Broken?</b> &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be broken,&rdquo; he whispered fiercely to Maester Luwin, who&rsquo;d been seated to his right.<b> &ldquo;I want to be a knight.</b></i>&rdquo; - Bran VI, AGOT</p><p>People assume that Bran won\u2019t really get to be one beyond his fantasy battle related role, where they assume he will die or become part of the godhood forever, but I don\u2019t think people consider the subversion his story.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>One day I will be like him. The thought filled Bran with dread. Bad enough that he was broken, with his useless legs. <b>Was he doomed to lose the rest too, to spend all of his years with a weirwood growing in him and through him?</b> Lord Brynden drew his life from the tree, Leaf told them. He did not eat, he did not drink. He slept, he dreamed, he watched. <b>I was going to be a knight, Bran remembered. I used to run and climb and fight. It seemed a thousand years ago.</b></i></p><p><i>What was he now? Only Bran the broken boy, Brandon of House Stark, prince of a lost kingdom, lord of a burned castle, heir to ruins.<b> He had thought the three-eyed crow would be a sorcerer, a wise old wizard who could fix his legs, but that was some stupid child&rsquo;s dream, he realized now. </b>I am too old for such fancies, he told himself. A thousand eyes, a hundred skins, wisdom deep as the roots of ancient trees. <b>That was as good as being a knight. Almost as good, anyway.</b></i>\u201c - Bran III, ADWD<br/></p><p>It\u2019s not enough for Bran, even as he settles for it. But he might lose sight of this for a while, like the show. However, the threat to something he loves - his family - might bring him back. Jaime\u2019s last words to Bran were\u00a0\u201cThe things we do for love\u201d. Perhaps, he might find himself on the other end as even Ned thinks on Robert\u2019s deathbed\u00a0\u201cThe lies we tell for love\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>As I mentioned before all the three\u00a0\u201cshadows\u201d have been part of the kingsguard and that includes Robert Strong. Incidentally, Bran once dreamed of joining the kingsguard and wearing a white cloak.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i><b>Bran was going to be a knight himself someday, one of the Kingsguard. O</b>ld Nan said they were the finest swords in all the realm.<b> There were only seven of them, and they wore white armor</b> and had no wives or children, but lived only to serve the king. Bran knew all the stories. Their names were like music to him. Serwyn of the Mirror Shield. Ser Ryam Redwyne. Prince Aemon the Dragonknight. The twins Ser Erryk and Ser Arryk, who had died on one another&rsquo;s swords hundreds of years ago, when brother fought sister in the war the singers called the Dance of the Dragons. The White Bull, Gerold Hightower. Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning. Barristan the Bold.</i>\u201d - Bran II, AGOT<br/></p><p>So in the case that he found himself wanting to protect someone he loves, taking on Robert Strong\u2019s empty suit of armor might be a way.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>They continued down the serpentine and across a small sunken courtyard. Ser Dontos shoved open a heavy door and lit a taper. They were inside a long gallery. <b>Along the walls stood empty suits of armor,</b> dark and dusty, their helms crested with rows of scales that continued down their backs. <b>As they hurried past, the taper&rsquo;s light made the shadows of each scale stretch and twist. The hollow knights are turning into dragons, she thought.</b></i>\u201c - Sansa V, ASOS<br/></p><p><a href=\"https://www.quora.com/Could-Bran-warging-into-the-mountain-be-the-Valonqar\" target=\"_blank\">Sarah Nunn on Quora</a> has discussed how this would be narratively unsatisfying because Bran means little to Cersei as <i>Robb\u2019s</i> brother. True, it would be less satisfying than Cersei being killed by her own blood. However, considering Sansa was Cersei\u2019s longterm victim and someone she still holds a grudge against, if Bran were to intervene to defend her, there would be a narrative payoff. This would also go along with Sansa as the YMBQ theory (<a href=\"https://randomtvramblings.tumblr.com/post/171186545077/sansa-as-the-ymbq-pt-2-everything-cersei-holds\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>) and Maggy the Frog\u2019s prophecy possibly suggesting that the valonqar is her brother. Cersei never considers this possibility.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>This would mean that Sansa would have to have a last encounter with Cersei. It would be understandable if people were skeptical about the idea. I was too for a while because of the issue of seeing Sansa in a disempowered position again. But when you think about it, by the end of the story, the tables would\u2019ve turned quite a lot as Cersei would be isolated and even if Sansa falls into her hands, that would be after she has reunited with her family and Jaime has pledged himself to her. That would be leverage in Sansa\u2019s hands to dangle in front of Cersei. Because killing or harming Sansa would mean alienating Jaime further away from herself but if she spared her there was a chance, Jaime might still take her back. This would also be a point in the story where it\u2019s possible Cersei\u2019s and Sansa\u2019s conversation in ACOK about love and fear may come into the mix.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>Robert wanted to be loved. My brother Tyrion has the same disease. Do you want to be loved, Sansa?&ldquo;</i></p><p><i>&quot;Everyone wants to be loved.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I see flowering hasn&rsquo;t made you any brighter,&rdquo; said Cersei. &ldquo;Sansa, permit me to share a bit of womanly wisdom with you on this very special day. Love is poison. A sweet poison, yes, but it will kill you all the same.</i>&rdquo; - Sansa IV, ACOK<br/></p><p>Cersei was wrong, as Sansa proves through inspiring knightly honour in a number of characters like the Hound and Dontos by showing concern and understanding for them. Basically, it would be a point where the ideological difference between Ned\u2019s and Tywin\u2019s philosophies would be tested out and Cersei would find that she had built her own doom.\u00a0</p><p>The question of how Jaime\u2019s fate ties to his misdeed with Bran at the beginning of the story is something I\u2019m still unsure of. Pledging himself to Catelyn\u2019s daughters would be part of that atonement, but bookwise he doesn\u2019t even think about Bran while thinking about his vows. That\u2019s one part of the story I\u2019ve never really been able to piece together and my guesses are shots in the dark there.\u00a0</p><p>Still, there is a kind of poetry to a \u201cmonster\u201d killing a beautiful queen, but the roles of good and evil being subverted. Though not by the character Cersei expects. It\u2019s by the monster she made and the little boy her family broke and it may all be for a girl she victimised.</p><p>I could be wrong and it could just as well be Jaime as she sees him as a reflection of herself in male form or it could be Arya as Jon\u2019s or Sansa\u2019s \u201clittle sister\u201d as Valyrian is gender neutral. But I think it\u2019s important that what happened with Bran and Sansa will come back to haunt the Lannisters again. Most people might\u2019ve forgotten it, especially what happened to Bran, but that\u2019s where the story begun and has yet to be resolved. There needs to be personal catharsis to Bran\u2019s arc beyond just his choice to help in saving humanity. He has his trauma too.\u00a0</p>",

Some monster?</b>\u201d The golden girl did not like that foretelling.</i> - Cersei VIII, AFFC</p><p>\u201c<i>Tyrion is the valonqar,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you use that word in Myr? <b>It\u2019s High Valyrian, it means little brother</b>.\u201d She had asked Septa Saranella about the word, after Melara drowned.</i></p><p><i>Taena took her hand and stroked it. \u201c<b>This was a hateful woman, old and sick and ugly. You were young and beautiful, full of life and pride.</b> She lived in Lannisport, you said, so she would have known of the dwarf and how he killed your lady mother. This creature dared not strike you, because of who you were, so she sought to wound you with her viper\u2019s tongue.</i>\u201d - Cersei IX, AFFC</p><p>Cersei thinks it\u2019s about Tyrion and resents him from the get go because he looks so ugly. Given GRRM\u2019s patterns, the audience thinks it will be Jaime because he was born a few seconds after her. But they overlook that she underestimates the people that surround her and her lack of respect and love for them and the collateral damage she creates in her wake.\u00a0</p><p>It could be the Hound but the act of choking implies a kind of personal anger at the person, like Tyrion strangling Shae to death.\u00a0</p><p>It could be Arya using the Strangler poison used on Joffrey, but she already has her on her list and Arya\u2019s journey is meant to push her towards walking away from her coping mechanism of revenge as justice.\u00a0</p><p>What the audience doesn\u2019t think about is Bran. It\u2019s noteworthy that Cersei doesn\u2019t think of him either in her walk of shame even when she sees Tywin, Melara, Ned, Sansa, Lady, Tyrion and Joffrey.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cThe queen began to see familiar faces. A bald man with bushy side-whiskers frowned down from a window with her father\u2019s frown, and <b>for an instant looked so much like Lord Tywin</b> that she stumbled. A young girl sat beneath a fountain, drenched in spray, and stared at her with <b>Melara Hetherspoon\u2019s accusing eyes</b>. She saw <b>Ned Stark, and beside him little Sansa with her auburn hair and a shaggy grey dog that might have been her wolf</b>. Every child squirming through the crowd became <b>her brother Tyrion</b>, jeering at her as he had jeered when Joffrey died. And <b>there was Joff as well, her son</b>, her firstborn, her beautiful bright boy with his golden curls and his sweet smile, he had such lovely lips, he \u2026</i>\u201d - Cersei II, ADWD<br></p><p>To her credit, Cersei didn\u2019t want Jaime to push him off the First Keep. But she did want Jaime to hunt down Arya and kill her after she set Nymeria on Joffrey. If Bran spoke up, I doubt that she would hesitate. It\u2019s also worth noting that Cersei still sees Ned beside Sansa and Lady, who she wanted to spare if he lied about being a traitor and took the black. It\u2019s Joffrey that went against all their plans the last minute. So not seeing Bran here makes his absence stick out jarringly.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>She also doesn\u2019t regret how she treated Tyrion or Sansa or the people around her. She doesn\u2019t recognise her and her family\u2019s abuse but rather sees it as a kindness because she could\u2019ve treated her worse as her hostage.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cYour Grace has forgotten the Lady Sansa,\u201d said Pycelle.The queen bristled.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cI most certainly have not forgotten that little she-wolf.\u201d She refused to say the girl\u2019s name. \u201cI ought to have shown her to the black cells as the daughter of a traitor, but instead I made her part of mine own household. She shared my hearth and hall, played with my own children. <b>I fed her, dressed her, tried to make her a little less ignorant about the world, and how did she repay me for my kindness? </b>She helped murder my son. When we find the Imp, we will find the Lady Sansa too. <b>She is not dead \u2026 but before I am done with her, I promise you, she will be singing to the Stranger, begging for his kiss</b>.\u201d</i> - Cersei IV, AFFC<br></p><p>\u00a0She only had love for her children, her father and Jaime. She loses all of them and drives even Jaime away. So it makes sense that the last knight and champion she has will turn against her as well. But as said, he is the Hound\u2019s older brother.\u00a0</p><p>If Bran were to pull off this act, it would be the darkest one he has done so far as it would require choking her with two hands. I don\u2019t think Bran would do it merely for revenge though. The desire to protect might push him and considering Sansa is the one who developed the longest relationship with Cersei, it may be about her.\u00a0</p><h2><b>Monsters and Knights</b></h2><p>It\u2019s worth noting that Cersei also seems to relate the valonqar to a monster and she often describes Tyrion as \u201ctwisted little brother\u201d or \u201ctwisted little monsters\u201d.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201c<b>And when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you</b>.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201c<b>What is a valonqar? Some monster?</b>\u201d The golden girl did not like that foretelling.</i>\u00a0- Cersei VIII, AFFC</p><p> \u201c<i>I am dreaming still, Cersei thought. I have not woken, nor has my nightmare ended. Tyrion will creep out from under the bed soon and begin to laugh at me. But that was folly. Her dwarf brother was down in the black cells, condemned to die this very day. She looked down at her hands, turning them over to make certain all her fingers were still there. When she ran a hand down her arm the skin was covered with gooseprickles, but unbroken. There were no cuts on her legs, no gashes on the soles of her feet. A dream, that\u2019s all it was, a dream. I drank too much last night, these fears are only humors born of wine. I will be the one laughing, come dusk. My children will be safe, Tommen\u2019s throne will be secure, and <b>my twisted little valonqar will be short a head and rotting</b>.</i>\u201d - Cersei I, AFFC</p><p>\u201c<i>She had never truly believed that he was harboring the Imp. Her <b>twisted little brother</b> was too clever to allow Lollys to name her wretched ill-begotten bastard after him, knowing it was sure to draw the queen\u2019s wroth down upon her.</i>\u201d - Cersei VII, AFFC<br></p><p><i>Cersei had never realized there were so many dwarfs. \u201cIs the whole world overrun with these <b>twisted little monsters</b>?\u201d she complained, whilst the last of the informers was being ushered out. \u201cHow many of them can there be?\u201d</i> - Cersei VIII, AFFC<br></p><p>Bran is also \u201clittle\u201d given his age and the fact that he cannot walk. The word \u201ctwisted\u201d is also used for Winterfell Bran and the heart tree. The roots of the heart tree are even described as \u201ca man\u2019s gnarled arms\u201d or\u00a0\u201cas thick as a giant\u2019s legs\u201d. This matters because Bran is often related to trees.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>To a boy, Winterfell was a grey stone labyrinth of walls and towers and courtyards and tunnels spreading out in all directions. In the older parts of the castle, the halls slanted up and down so that you couldn\u2019t even be sure what floor you were on. The place had grown over the centuries like <b>some monstrous stone tree</b>, Maester Luwin told him once, and <b>its branches were gnarled and thick and twisted, its roots sunk deep into the earth</b>.</i>\u201d - Bran II, AGOT</p><p><i>\u201c<b>The roots were everywhere, twisting through earth and stone,</b> closing off some passages and holding up the roofs of others. All the color is gone, Bran realized suddenly. The world was black soil and white wood. <b>The heart tree at Winterfell had roots as thick around as a giant\u2019s legs</b>, but these were even thicker. And Bran had never seen so many of them. There must be a whole grove of weirwoods growing up above us</i>.\u201d - Bran II, ADWD<br></p><p><i>\u201cLord Eddard Stark sat upon a rock beside the deep black pool in the godswood, the pale <b>roots of the heart tree twisting around him like an old man\u2019s gnarled arms</b>.</i>\u201d - Bran III, ADWD<br></p><p>\u201c<i>Your brother Jon asked it of me. And I have a tender spot in my heart for <b>cripples and bastards and broken things</b>.</i>\u201d Tyrion Lannister placed a hand over his heart and grinned. - Bran IV, AGOT<br></p><p>So there\u2019s a connection with the heart tree\u2019s immovable but twisted roots and Bran\u2019s lower limbs. There\u2019s also the fact that even Willas is described as\u00a0\u201ctwisted\u201d for having a bad leg.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cMy son Willas is an able lad,\u201d the man replied, refusing to take her perfectly good hint. \u201c<b>His leg may be twisted</b> but he has no want of wits.\u201d</i> - Cersei II, AFFC<br></p><p>Bran is in turn caught in a dilemma of wanting to be a knight while people see him as \u201cbroken\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>Harrion Karstark, the oldest of Lord Rickard\u2019s sons, bowed, and his brothers after him, yet as they settled back in their places he heard the younger two talking in low voices, over the clatter of wine cups. \"\u2026 sooner die than live like that,\u201d muttered one, his father\u2019s namesake Eddard, and his brother Torrhen said likely <b>the boy was broken inside as well as out,</b> too craven to take his own life.</i></p><p><i><b>Broken, Bran thought bitterly as he clutched his knife. Is that what he was now? Bran the Broken?</b> \u201cI don\u2019t want to be broken,\u201d he whispered fiercely to Maester Luwin, who\u2019d been seated to his right.<b> \u201cI want to be a knight.</b></i>\u201d - Bran VI, AGOT</p><p>People assume that Bran won\u2019t really get to be one beyond his fantasy battle related role, where they assume he will die or become part of the godhood forever, but I don\u2019t think people consider the subversion his story.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>One day I will be like him. The thought filled Bran with dread. Bad enough that he was broken, with his useless legs. <b>Was he doomed to lose the rest too, to spend all of his years with a weirwood growing in him and through him?</b> Lord Brynden drew his life from the tree, Leaf told them. He did not eat, he did not drink. He slept, he dreamed, he watched. <b>I was going to be a knight, Bran remembered. I used to run and climb and fight. It seemed a thousand years ago.</b></i></p><p><i>What was he now? Only Bran the broken boy, Brandon of House Stark, prince of a lost kingdom, lord of a burned castle, heir to ruins.<b> He had thought the three-eyed crow would be a sorcerer, a wise old wizard who could fix his legs, but that was some stupid child\u2019s dream, he realized now. </b>I am too old for such fancies, he told himself. A thousand eyes, a hundred skins, wisdom deep as the roots of ancient trees. <b>That was as good as being a knight. Almost as good, anyway.</b></i>\u201c - Bran III, ADWD<br></p><p>It\u2019s not enough for Bran, even as he settles for it. But he might lose sight of this for a while, like the show. However, the threat to something he loves - his family - might bring him back. Jaime\u2019s last words to Bran were\u00a0\u201cThe things we do for love\u201d. Perhaps, he might find himself on the other end as even Ned thinks on Robert\u2019s deathbed\u00a0\u201cThe lies we tell for love\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>As I mentioned before all the three\u00a0\u201cshadows\u201d have been part of the kingsguard and that includes Robert Strong. Incidentally, Bran once dreamed of joining the kingsguard and wearing a white cloak.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i><b>Bran was going to be a knight himself someday, one of the Kingsguard. O</b>ld Nan said they were the finest swords in all the realm.<b> There were only seven of them, and they wore white armor</b> and had no wives or children, but lived only to serve the king. Bran knew all the stories. Their names were like music to him. Serwyn of the Mirror Shield. Ser Ryam Redwyne. Prince Aemon the Dragonknight. The twins Ser Erryk and Ser Arryk, who had died on one another\u2019s swords hundreds of years ago, when brother fought sister in the war the singers called the Dance of the Dragons. The White Bull, Gerold Hightower. Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning. Barristan the Bold.</i>\u201d - Bran II, AGOT<br></p><p>So in the case that he found himself wanting to protect someone he loves, taking on Robert Strong\u2019s empty suit of armor might be a way.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>They continued down the serpentine and across a small sunken courtyard. Ser Dontos shoved open a heavy door and lit a taper. They were inside a long gallery. <b>Along the walls stood empty suits of armor,</b> dark and dusty, their helms crested with rows of scales that continued down their backs. <b>As they hurried past, the taper\u2019s light made the shadows of each scale stretch and twist. The hollow knights are turning into dragons, she thought.</b></i>\u201c - Sansa V, ASOS<br></p><p><a href=\"https://www.quora.com/Could-Bran-warging-into-the-mountain-be-the-Valonqar\" target=\"_blank\">Sarah Nunn on Quora</a> has discussed how this would be narratively unsatisfying because Bran means little to Cersei as <i>Robb\u2019s</i> brother. True, it would be less satisfying than Cersei being killed by her own blood. However, considering Sansa was Cersei\u2019s longterm victim and someone she still holds a grudge against, if Bran were to intervene to defend her, there would be a narrative payoff. This would also go along with Sansa as the YMBQ theory (<a href=\"https://randomtvramblings.tumblr.com/post/171186545077/sansa-as-the-ymbq-pt-2-everything-cersei-holds\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>) and Maggy the Frog\u2019s prophecy possibly suggesting that the valonqar is her brother. Cersei never considers this possibility.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>This would mean that Sansa would have to have a last encounter with Cersei. It would be understandable if people were skeptical about the idea. I was too for a while because of the issue of seeing Sansa in a disempowered position again. But when you think about it, by the end of the story, the tables would\u2019ve turned quite a lot as Cersei would be isolated and even if Sansa falls into her hands, that would be after she has reunited with her family and Jaime has pledged himself to her. That would be leverage in Sansa\u2019s hands to dangle in front of Cersei. Because killing or harming Sansa would mean alienating Jaime further away from herself but if she spared her there was a chance, Jaime might still take her back. This would also be a point in the story where it\u2019s possible Cersei\u2019s and Sansa\u2019s conversation in ACOK about love and fear may come into the mix.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201c<i>Robert wanted to be loved. My brother Tyrion has the same disease. Do you want to be loved, Sansa?\u201c</i></p><p><i>\"Everyone wants to be loved.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI see flowering hasn\u2019t made you any brighter,\u201d said Cersei. \u201cSansa, permit me to share a bit of womanly wisdom with you on this very special day. Love is poison. A sweet poison, yes, but it will kill you all the same.</i>\u201d - Sansa IV, ACOK<br></p><p>Cersei was wrong, as Sansa proves through inspiring knightly honour in a number of characters like the Hound and Dontos by showing concern and understanding for them. Basically, it would be a point where the ideological difference between Ned\u2019s and Tywin\u2019s philosophies would be tested out and Cersei would find that she had built her own doom.\u00a0</p><p>The question of how Jaime\u2019s fate ties to his misdeed with Bran at the beginning of the story is something I\u2019m still unsure of. Pledging himself to Catelyn\u2019s daughters would be part of that atonement, but bookwise he doesn\u2019t even think about Bran while thinking about his vows. That\u2019s one part of the story I\u2019ve never really been able to piece together and my guesses are shots in the dark there.\u00a0</p><p>Still, there is a kind of poetry to a \u201cmonster\u201d killing a beautiful queen, but the roles of good and evil being subverted. Though not by the character Cersei expects. It\u2019s by the monster she made and the little boy her family broke and it may all be for a girl she victimised.</p><p>I could be wrong and it could just as well be Jaime as she sees him as a reflection of herself in male form or it could be Arya as Jon\u2019s or Sansa\u2019s \u201clittle sister\u201d as Valyrian is gender neutral. But I think it\u2019s important that what happened with Bran and Sansa will come back to haunt the Lannisters again. Most people might\u2019ve forgotten it, especially what happened to Bran, but that\u2019s where the story begun and has yet to be resolved. There needs to be personal catharsis to Bran\u2019s arc beyond just his choice to help in saving humanity. He has his trauma too.\u00a0</p></p>",

But to bring it up would be a reminder to Cersei (and Jaime) of the young life they broke.\u00a0</p><p><i> Far above him, outlined against a vast pale moon, he thought he could see the shapes of gargoyles.

This is a tactic that Sansa uses. Adding on the presence of Hodor, who Bran often describes as a\u00a0\u201csimpleminded giant\u201d, I believe this truth will count towards the end of the story in relation to his own personal arc.\u00a0</p><h2><b>Maggy the Frog\u2019s Prophecy</b></h2><p>To examine how possible it is, we have to look back at Cersei\u2019s prophecy.\u00a0</p><p><i>Malice gleamed in Maggy\u2019s yellow eyes. \u201c<b>Queen you shall be \u2026 until there comes another, younger and more beautiful, to cast you down and take all that you hold dear.</b>\u201d</i></p><p><i>Anger flashed across the child\u2019s face. \u201cIf she tries I will have my brother kill her.\u201d<b> </b>Even then she would not stop, willful child as she was.

This creature dared not strike you, because of who you were, so she sought to wound you with her viper\u2019s tongue.</i>\u201d - Cersei IX, AFFC</p><p>Cersei thinks it\u2019s about Tyrion and resents him from the get go because he looks so ugly. Given GRRM\u2019s patterns, the audience thinks it will be Jaime because he was born a few seconds after her. But they overlook that she underestimates the people that surround her and her lack of respect and love for them and the collateral damage she creates in her wake.\u00a0</p><p>It could be the Hound but the act of choking implies a kind of personal anger at the person, like Tyrion strangling Shae to death.\u00a0</p><p>It could be Arya using the Strangler poison used on Joffrey, but she already has her on her list and Arya\u2019s journey is meant to push her towards walking away from her coping mechanism of revenge as justice.\u00a0</p><p>What the audience doesn\u2019t think about is Bran. It\u2019s noteworthy that Cersei doesn\u2019t think of him either in her walk of shame even when she sees Tywin, Melara, Ned, Sansa, Lady, Tyrion and Joffrey.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cThe queen began to see familiar faces. A bald man with bushy side-whiskers frowned down from a window with her father\u2019s frown, and <b>for an instant looked so much like Lord Tywin</b> that she stumbled.

She saw <b>Ned Stark, and beside him little Sansa with her auburn hair and a shaggy grey dog that might have been her wolf</b>. Every child squirming through the crowd became <b>her brother Tyrion</b>, jeering at her as he had jeered when Joffrey died.

But she did want Jaime to hunt down Arya and kill her after she set Nymeria on Joffrey. If Bran spoke up, I doubt that she would hesitate. It\u2019s also worth noting that Cersei still sees Ned beside Sansa and Lady, who she wanted to spare if he lied about being a traitor and took the black. It\u2019s Joffrey that went against all their plans the last minute. So not seeing Bran here makes his absence stick out jarringly.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>She also doesn\u2019t regret how she treated Tyrion or Sansa or the people around her. She doesn\u2019t recognise her and her family\u2019s abuse but rather sees it as a kindness because she could\u2019ve treated her worse as her hostage.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cYour Grace has forgotten the Lady Sansa,\u201d said Pycelle.The queen bristled.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cI most certainly have not forgotten that little she-wolf.\u201d She refused to say the girl\u2019s name. \u201cI ought to have shown her to the black cells as the daughter of a traitor, but instead I made her part of mine own household. She shared my hearth and hall, played with my own children. <b>I fed her, dressed her, tried to make her a little less ignorant about the world, and how did she repay me for my kindness? </b>She helped murder my son. When we find the Imp, we will find the Lady Sansa too. <b>She is not dead \u2026 but before I am done with her, I promise you, she will be singing to the Stranger, begging for his kiss</b>.\u201d</i> - Cersei IV, AFFC<br></p><p>\u00a0She only had love for her children, her father and Jaime. She loses all of them and drives even Jaime away. So it makes sense that the last knight and champion she has will turn against her as well. But as said, he is the Hound\u2019s older brother.\u00a0</p><p>If Bran were to pull off this act, it would be the darkest one he has done so far as it would require choking her with two hands. I don\u2019t think Bran would do it merely for revenge though. The desire to protect might push him and considering Sansa is the one who developed the longest relationship with Cersei, it may be about her.\u00a0</p><h2><b>Monsters and Knights</b></h2><p>It\u2019s worth noting that Cersei also seems to relate the valonqar to a monster and she often describes Tyrion as \u201ctwisted little brother\u201d or \u201ctwisted little monsters\u201d.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201c<b>And when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you</b>.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201c<b>What is a valonqar?

Tyrion will creep out from under the bed soon and begin to laugh at me. But that was folly. Her dwarf brother was down in the black cells, condemned to die this very day. She looked down at her hands, turning them over to make certain all her fingers were still there. When she ran a hand down her arm the skin was covered with gooseprickles, but unbroken. There were no cuts on her legs, no gashes on the soles of her feet. A dream, that\u2019s all it was, a dream. I drank too much last night, these fears are only humors born of wine. I will be the one laughing, come dusk. My children will be safe, Tommen\u2019s throne will be secure, and <b>my twisted little valonqar will be short a head and rotting</b>.</i>\u201d - Cersei I, AFFC</p><p>\u201c<i>She had never truly believed that he was harboring the Imp.

The word \u201ctwisted\u201d is also used for Winterfell Bran and the heart tree. The roots of the heart tree are even described as \u201ca man\u2019s gnarled arms\u201d or\u00a0\u201cas thick as a giant\u2019s legs\u201d. This matters because Bran is often related to trees.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>To a boy, Winterfell was a grey stone labyrinth of walls and towers and courtyards and tunnels spreading out in all directions. In the older parts of the castle, the halls slanted up and down so that you couldn\u2019t even be sure what floor you were on. The place had grown over the centuries like <b>some monstrous stone tree</b>, Maester Luwin told him once, and <b>its branches were gnarled and thick and twisted, its roots sunk deep into the earth</b>.</i>\u201d - Bran II, AGOT</p><p><i>\u201c<b>The roots were everywhere, twisting through earth and stone,</b> closing off some passages and holding up the roofs of others. All the color is gone, Bran realized suddenly. The world was black soil and white wood. <b>The heart tree at Winterfell had roots as thick around as a giant\u2019s legs</b>, but these were even thicker. And Bran had never seen so many of them. There must be a whole grove of weirwoods growing up above us</i>.\u201d - Bran II, ADWD<br></p><p><i>\u201cLord Eddard Stark sat upon a rock beside the deep black pool in the godswood, the pale <b>roots of the heart tree twisting around him like an old man\u2019s gnarled arms</b>.</i>\u201d - Bran III, ADWD<br></p><p>\u201c<i>Your brother Jon asked it of me. And I have a tender spot in my heart for <b>cripples and bastards and broken things</b>.</i>\u201d Tyrion Lannister placed a hand over his heart and grinned. - Bran IV, AGOT<br></p><p>So there\u2019s a connection with the heart tree\u2019s immovable but twisted roots and Bran\u2019s lower limbs. There\u2019s also the fact that even Willas is described as\u00a0\u201ctwisted\u201d for having a bad leg.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cMy son Willas is an able lad,\u201d the man replied, refusing to take her perfectly good hint. \u201c<b>His leg may be twisted</b> but he has no want of wits.\u201d</i> - Cersei II, AFFC<br></p><p>Bran is in turn caught in a dilemma of wanting to be a knight while people see him as \u201cbroken\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>Harrion Karstark, the oldest of Lord Rickard\u2019s sons, bowed, and his brothers after him, yet as they settled back in their places he heard the younger two talking in low voices, over the clatter of wine cups. \"\u2026 sooner die than live like that,\u201d muttered one, his father\u2019s namesake Eddard, and his brother Torrhen said likely <b>the boy was broken inside as well as out,</b> too craven to take his own life.</i></p><p><i><b>Broken, Bran thought bitterly as he clutched his knife. Is that what he was now? Bran the Broken?</b> \u201cI don\u2019t want to be broken,\u201d he whispered fiercely to Maester Luwin, who\u2019d been seated to his right.<b> \u201cI want to be a knight.</b></i>\u201d - Bran VI, AGOT</p><p>People assume that Bran won\u2019t really get to be one beyond his fantasy battle related role, where they assume he will die or become part of the godhood forever, but I don\u2019t think people consider the subversion his story.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>One day I will be like him. The thought filled Bran with dread. Bad enough that he was broken, with his useless legs. <b>Was he doomed to lose the rest too, to spend all of his years with a weirwood growing in him and through him?</b> Lord Brynden drew his life from the tree, Leaf told them. He did not eat, he did not drink. He slept, he dreamed, he watched. <b>I was going to be a knight, Bran remembered. I used to run and climb and fight. It seemed a thousand years ago.</b></i></p><p><i>What was he now? Only Bran the broken boy, Brandon of House Stark, prince of a lost kingdom, lord of a burned castle, heir to ruins.<b> He had thought the three-eyed crow would be a sorcerer, a wise old wizard who could fix his legs, but that was some stupid child\u2019s dream, he realized now. </b>I am too old for such fancies, he told himself. A thousand eyes, a hundred skins, wisdom deep as the roots of ancient trees. <b>That was as good as being a knight. Almost as good, anyway.</b></i>\u201c - Bran III, ADWD<br></p><p>It\u2019s not enough for Bran, even as he settles for it. But he might lose sight of this for a while, like the show. However, the threat to something he loves - his family - might bring him back. Jaime\u2019s last words to Bran were\u00a0\u201cThe things we do for love\u201d. Perhaps, he might find himself on the other end as even Ned thinks on Robert\u2019s deathbed\u00a0\u201cThe lies we tell for love\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>As I mentioned before all the three\u00a0\u201cshadows\u201d have been part of the kingsguard and that includes Robert Strong. Incidentally, Bran once dreamed of joining the kingsguard and wearing a white cloak.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i><b>Bran was going to be a knight himself someday, one of the Kingsguard. O</b>ld Nan said they were the finest swords in all the realm.<b> There were only seven of them, and they wore white armor</b> and had no wives or children, but lived only to serve the king.

The twins Ser Erryk and Ser Arryk, who had died on one another\u2019s swords hundreds of years ago, when brother fought sister in the war the singers called the Dance of the Dragons. The White Bull, Gerold Hightower. Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning. Barristan the Bold.</i>\u201d - Bran II, AGOT<br></p><p>So in the case that he found himself wanting to protect someone he loves, taking on Robert Strong\u2019s empty suit of armor might be a way.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>They continued down the serpentine and across a small sunken courtyard. Ser Dontos shoved open a heavy door and lit a taper. They were inside a long gallery. <b>Along the walls stood empty suits of armor,</b> dark and dusty, their helms crested with rows of scales that continued down their backs. <b>As they hurried past, the taper\u2019s light made the shadows of each scale stretch and twist. The hollow knights are turning into dragons, she thought.</b></i>\u201c - Sansa V, ASOS<br></p><p><a href=\"https://www.quora.com/Could-Bran-warging-into-the-mountain-be-the-Valonqar\" target=\"_blank\">Sarah Nunn on Quora</a> has discussed how this would be narratively unsatisfying because Bran means little to Cersei as <i>Robb\u2019s</i> brother. True, it would be less satisfying than Cersei being killed by her own blood. However, considering Sansa was Cersei\u2019s longterm victim and someone she still holds a grudge against, if Bran were to intervene to defend her, there would be a narrative payoff. This would also go along with Sansa as the YMBQ theory (<a href=\"https://randomtvramblings.tumblr.com/post/171186545077/sansa-as-the-ymbq-pt-2-everything-cersei-holds\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>) and Maggy the Frog\u2019s prophecy possibly suggesting that the valonqar is her brother. Cersei never considers this possibility.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>This would mean that Sansa would have to have a last encounter with Cersei. It would be understandable if people were skeptical about the idea. I was too for a while because of the issue of seeing Sansa in a disempowered position again. But when you think about it, by the end of the story, the tables would\u2019ve turned quite a lot as Cersei would be isolated and even if Sansa falls into her hands, that would be after she has reunited with her family and Jaime has pledged himself to her. That would be leverage in Sansa\u2019s hands to dangle in front of Cersei. Because killing or harming Sansa would mean alienating Jaime further away from herself but if she spared her there was a chance, Jaime might still take her back. This would also be a point in the story where it\u2019s possible Cersei\u2019s and Sansa\u2019s conversation in ACOK about love and fear may come into the mix.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201c<i>Robert wanted to be loved. My brother Tyrion has the same disease. Do you want to be loved, Sansa?\u201c</i></p><p><i>\"Everyone wants to be loved.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI see flowering hasn\u2019t made you any brighter,\u201d said Cersei. \u201cSansa, permit me to share a bit of womanly wisdom with you on this very special day. Love is poison. A sweet poison, yes, but it will kill you all the same.</i>\u201d - Sansa IV, ACOK<br></p><p>Cersei was wrong, as Sansa proves through inspiring knightly honour in a number of characters like the Hound and Dontos by showing concern and understanding for them. Basically, it would be a point where the ideological difference between Ned\u2019s and Tywin\u2019s philosophies would be tested out and Cersei would find that she had built her own doom.\u00a0</p><p>The question of how Jaime\u2019s fate ties to his misdeed with Bran at the beginning of the story is something I\u2019m still unsure of. Pledging himself to Catelyn\u2019s daughters would be part of that atonement, but bookwise he doesn\u2019t even think about Bran while thinking about his vows. That\u2019s one part of the story I\u2019ve never really been able to piece together and my guesses are shots in the dark there.\u00a0</p><p>Still, there is a kind of poetry to a \u201cmonster\u201d killing a beautiful queen, but the roles of good and evil being subverted. Though not by the character Cersei expects. It\u2019s by the monster she made and the little boy her family broke and it may all be for a girl she victimised.</p><p>I could be wrong and it could just as well be Jaime as she sees him as a reflection of herself in male form or it could be Arya as Jon\u2019s or Sansa\u2019s \u201clittle sister\u201d as Valyrian is gender neutral. But I think it\u2019s important that what happened with Bran and Sansa will come back to haunt the Lannisters again. Most people might\u2019ve forgotten it, especially what happened to Bran, but that\u2019s where the story begun and has yet to be resolved. There needs to be personal catharsis to Bran\u2019s arc beyond just his choice to help in saving humanity. He has his trauma too.\u00a0</p></p>",

But then I came across <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sansannister/status/1091864822864637953\" target=\"_blank\">another post</a>, which postulated that the Mountain/Robert Strong will be the one to kill Cersei as Jaime leaving her with him parallels Rhaella leaving Aerys II with Jaime.&nbsp;</p><p>But if valonqar means &ldquo;little brother&rdquo;, Gregor&nbsp;&ldquo;the Hound&rdquo; Clegane is the older brother to Sandor&nbsp;&ldquo;the Hound&rdquo; Clegane. Bran, however, is still Sansa&rsquo;s younger brother, who all the Lannisters have some sort of relationship with - directly or indirectly. There&rsquo;s also a lot of &ldquo;monster&rdquo; imagery attached to the valonqar and being a cripple, Bran would fit the subversion of the notion.&nbsp;</p><h2><b>The Three Shadows</b></h2><p>From the books and show we know that he could warg into a human or a more difficult being from his experience with Hodor, who was also incidentally considered a giant. But more than that, there is a certain instance in AGOT, that has the most crucial evidence for this theory.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>He looked south, and saw the great blue-green rush of the Trident. He saw his father pleading with the king, his face etched with grief. </i>He saw Sansa crying herself to sleep at night, and he saw Arya watching in silence and holding her secrets hard in her heart. <b>There were shadows all around them. </b><i><b>One shadow was dark as ash, with the terrible face of a hound. Another was armored like the sun, golden and beautiful. Over them both loomed a giant in armor made of stone, but when he opened his visor, there was nothing inside but darkness and thick black blood.</b></i>&rdquo; - Bran III, AGOT<br /></p><p>The first shadow&nbsp;&ldquo;with a terrible face of a hound&rdquo; is obviously the Hound and the second&nbsp;&ldquo;armored like the sun, golden and beautiful&rdquo; is likely to be Jaime. But considering, Jaime threw Bran off a tower, it could be Brienne, who has blonde hair, is called&nbsp;&ldquo;the Beauty&rdquo; and whose House sigil bears a sun and moon. That&rsquo;s not enough grounds to dismiss Jaime as the vision has no sign of a moon, and the Hound and Jaime are juxtaposed against each other in their appearances playing on the Beauty and the Beast aspect.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, in the same chapter Jaime&rsquo;s face is described as&nbsp;&ldquo;shining with light&rdquo; and&nbsp;&ldquo;golden&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Bran was staring at his arms, his legs. He was so skinny, just skin stretched taut over bones. Had he always been so thin? He tried to remember. <b>A face swam up at him out of the grey mist, shining with light, golden. &ldquo;The things I do for love,&rdquo; it said.</b></i></p><p><i>Bran screamed.<br /></i></p><p><i>The crow took to the air, cawing. Not that, it shrieked at him. Forget that, you do not need it now, put it aside, put it away. It landed on Bran&rsquo;s shoulder, and pecked at him, and <b>the shining golden face was gone</b>. </i>- Bran III, AGOT<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>No harm will come to me today,&rdquo; Cersei said when the day&rsquo;s first light brushed her window. &ldquo;Only my pride will suffer.&rdquo; The words rang hollow in her ears. Jaime may yet come. <b>She pictured him riding through the morning mists, his golden armor bright in the light of the rising sun.</b></i>&rdquo;&nbsp;- Cersei II, ADWD<br /></p><p>Brienne also wasn&rsquo;t introduced until ACOK, so it&rsquo;s most likely to be Jaime.&nbsp;</p><p>And the third sounds a lot like the Mountain being resurrected as Robert Strong.&nbsp;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Ser Gregor.&rdquo; Qyburn shrugged. &ldquo;I have examined him, as you commanded. The poison on the Viper&rsquo;s spear was <b>manticore venom from the east</b>, I would stake my life on that.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Pycelle says no. He told my lord father that manticore venom kills the instant it reaches the heart.&rdquo;<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;And so it does. <b>But this venom has been thickened somehow</b>, so as to draw out the Mountain&rsquo;s dying.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Thickened? Thickened how? With some other substance?&rdquo;</i><br /></p><p><i>&ldquo;It may be as Your Grace suggests, though in most cases adulterating a poison only lessens its potency. It may be that the cause is &hellip; less natural, let us say. A spell, I think.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Is this one as big a fool as Pycelle? &ldquo;<b>So are you telling me that the Mountain is dying of some black sorcery?</b></i><i>&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Qyburn ignored the mockery in her voice. &ldquo;He is dying of the venom, but slowly, and in exquisite agony. My efforts to ease his pain have proved as fruitless as Pycelle&rsquo;s. Ser Gregor is overly accustomed to the poppy, I fear. His squire tells me that he is plagued by blinding headaches and oft quaffs the milk of the poppy as lesser men quaff ale. <b>Be that as it may, his veins have turned black from head to heel,</b> his water is clouded with pus, and the venom has eaten a hole in his side as large as my fist. It is a wonder that the man is still alive, if truth be told.&rdquo;</i>&nbsp;</p><p>- Cersei II, AFFC<br /></p><p><i>&ldquo;If that is Your Grace&rsquo;s wish,&rdquo; Qyburn said, &ldquo;but this poison &hellip; it would be useful to know more about it, would it not? <b>Send a knight to slay a knight and an archer to kill an archer, the smallfolk often say. To combat the black arts &hellip;</b>\"&nbsp;He did not finish the thought, but only smiled at her.</i></p><p><i>He is not Pycelle, that much is plain. The queen weighed him, wondering. \"Why did the Citadel take your chain?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;The archmaesters are all craven at heart. The grey sheep, Marwyn calls them. I was as skilled a healer as Ebrose, but aspired to surpass him. For hundreds of years the men of the Citadel have opened the bodies of the dead, to study the nature of life. I wished to understand the nature of death, so I opened the bodies of the living. For that crime the grey sheep shamed me and forced me into exile &hellip; <b>but I understand the nature of life and death better than any man in Oldtown</b>.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; That intrigued her. &ldquo;Very well. The Mountain is yours. Do what you will with him, but confine your studies to the black cells. <b>When he dies, bring me his head. My father promised it to Dorne. </b>Prince Doran would no doubt prefer to kill Gregor himself, but we all must suffer disappointments in this life.&rdquo;</i><br /></p><p>- Cersei II, AFFC</p><p>His veins have turned black and thickened due to the manticore venom, and he is resurrected by the dark arts. But also Qyburn has his head delivered to Dorne. This would fit Bran&rsquo;s vision of the empty visor and&nbsp;&ldquo;nothing inside but darkness and black blood&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Cersei never saw where Qyburn came from, but suddenly he was there beside them, scrambling to keep up with her champion&rsquo;s long strides. &ldquo;Your Grace,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is so good to have you back. <b>May I have the honor of presenting our newest member of the Kingsguard? This is Ser Robert Strong.</b>&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Ser Robert,&rdquo; Cersei whispered, as they entered the gates.<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;If it please Your Grace, Ser Robert has taken a holy vow of silence,&rdquo; Qyburn said. &ldquo;He has sworn that he will not speak until all of His Grace&rsquo;s enemies are dead and evil has been driven from the realm<b>.</b>&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Yes, thought Cersei Lannister. Oh, yes.&nbsp;</i></p><p>- Cersei II, ADWD<br /></p><p>On westeros.org, <a href=\"https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/Prophecies/Entry/1791/\" target=\"_blank\">the Citadel</a>&nbsp;theorises the same identities for these three shadows.&nbsp;If these three shadows are in fact the Hound, Jaime and Robert Strong, they all have served Cersei and House Lannister at some point and were part of the kingsguard. As two deserted her and have started to build an association with the Stark girls directly or indirectly, it is possible for the third to go against her as well. But as he&rsquo;s a zombie and as Bran&rsquo;s vision depicts his visor being empty, it&rsquo;s likely that he would be controlled by someone else and Bran has done this before with with a&nbsp;&ldquo;simpleminded giant&rdquo; Hodor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ac2be92c432b1f1e9db6134b873db8e4/tumblr_inline_pmd2tsvKAn1u48vsz_1280.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><i>Lightning slashed the sky, and Hodor whimpered. Then a clap of thunder rolled across the lake. &ldquo;HODOR!&rdquo; he roared, clapping his hands over his ears and stumbling in a circle through the darkness. &ldquo;HODOR! HODOR! HODOR!&rdquo;&ldquo;NO!\"&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Bran shouted back. \"NO HODORING!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>It did no good. &ldquo;HOOOODOR!&rdquo; moaned Hodor. Meera tried to catch him and calm him, but he was too strong. He flung her aside with no more than a shrug. &ldquo;HOOOOOODOOOOOOOR!&rdquo; the stableboy screamed as lightning filled the sky again, and even Jojen was shouting now, shouting at Bran and Meera to shut him up.<br /></i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Be quiet!&rdquo; Bran said in a shrill scared voice, reaching up uselessly for Hodor&rsquo;s leg as he crashed past, reaching, reaching.</b></i></p><p><i><b>Hodor staggered, and closed his mouth. He shook his head slowly from side to side, sank back to the floor, and sat crosslegged. When the thunder boomed, he scarcely seemed to hear it. </b>The four of them sat in the dark tower, scarce daring to breathe.</i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Bran, what did you do?&rdquo; Meera whispered.</b><br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; Bran shook his head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; <b>But he did. I reached for him, the way I reach for Summer. He had been Hodor for half a heartbeat</b>. It scared him.&nbsp;</i></p><p>- Bran III, ASOS<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>I can&rsquo;t let her fight the thing alone, he thought. <b>Summer was far away, but . .&nbsp;.</b></i></p><p><i><b>&hellip; he slipped his skin, and reached for Hodor.</b></i></p><p><i><b>It was not like sliding into Summer. </b>That was so easy now that Bran hardly thought about it. <b>This was harder, like trying to pull a left boot on your right foot. It fit all wrong, </b>and the boot was scared too, t<b>he boot didn&rsquo;t know what was happening, the boot was pushing the foot away. </b>He tasted vomit in the back of Hodor&rsquo;s throat, and that was almost enough to make him flee. <b>Instead he squirmed and shoved, sat up, gathered his legs under him&mdash;his huge strong legs&mdash;and rose. I&rsquo;m standing. He took a step. I&rsquo;m walking.</b> It was such a strange feeling that he almost fell. He could see himself on the cold stone floor, a little broken thing, but he wasn&rsquo;t broken now. He grabbed Hodor&rsquo;s longsword. The breathing was as loud as a blacksmith&rsquo;s bellows.</i>&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>- Bran IV, ASOS<br /></p><p>It would make sense because the story started with Bran being crippled by the Lannisters after witnessing Jaime and Cersei&rsquo;s incest A lot of readers forget this because of Jaime&rsquo;s vow to Catelyn to protect her daughters. But to bring it up would be a reminder to Cersei (and Jaime) of the young life they broke.&nbsp;</p><p><i> Far above him, outlined against a vast pale moon, he thought he could see the shapes of gargoyles. His arms were sore and aching, but he dared not rest. He forced himself to climb faster. The gargoyles watched him ascend. <b>Their eyes glowed red as hot coals in a brazier. Perhaps once they had been lions, but now they were twisted and grotesque.</b> Bran could hear them whispering to each other in soft stone voices terrible to hear.<b> He must not listen, he told himself, he must not hear, so long as he did not hear them he was safe.</b> But when the gargoyles pulled themselves loose from the stone and padded down the side of the tower to where Bran clung, he knew he was not safe after all. <b>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear,&rdquo; he wept as they came closer and closer, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t, I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>He woke gasping, <b>lost in darkness, and saw a vast shadow looming over him.</b> &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear,&rdquo; he whispered, trembling in fear, but <b>then the shadow said &ldquo;Hodor,&rdquo; and lit the candle by the bedside, and Bran sighed with relief.</b> </i>- Bran IV, AGOT<br /></p><p>Why is so much emphasis put on Bran trying to block out the truth over the series even after other characters suspect the relationship between Jaime and Cersei? This is a tactic that Sansa uses. Adding on the presence of Hodor, who Bran often describes as a&nbsp;&ldquo;simpleminded giant&rdquo;, I believe this truth will count towards the end of the story in relation to his own personal arc.&nbsp;</p><h2><b>Maggy the Frog&rsquo;s Prophecy</b></h2><p>To examine how possible it is, we have to look back at Cersei&rsquo;s prophecy.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Malice gleamed in Maggy&rsquo;s yellow eyes. &ldquo;<b>Queen you shall be &hellip; until there comes another, younger and more beautiful, to cast you down and take all that you hold dear.</b>&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Anger flashed across the child&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;If she tries I will have my brother kill her.&rdquo;<b> </b>Even then she would not stop, willful child as she was. She still had one more question due her, one more glimpse into her life to come. &ldquo;Will the king and I have children?&rdquo; she asked.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Oh, aye. Six-and-ten for him, and three for you. [&hellip;] </i><i>Gold shall be their crowns and gold their shrouds,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;<b>And when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you</b>.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;<b>What is a valonqar? Some monster?</b>&rdquo; The golden girl did not like that foretelling.</i> - Cersei VIII, AFFC</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Tyrion is the valonqar,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Do you use that word in Myr? <b>It&rsquo;s High Valyrian, it means little brother</b>.&rdquo; She had asked Septa Saranella about the word, after Melara drowned.</i></p><p><i>Taena took her hand and stroked it. &ldquo;<b>This was a hateful woman, old and sick and ugly. You were young and beautiful, full of life and pride.</b> She lived in Lannisport, you said, so she would have known of the dwarf and how he killed your lady mother. This creature dared not strike you, because of who you were, so she sought to wound you with her viper&rsquo;s tongue.</i>&rdquo; - Cersei IX, AFFC</p><p>Cersei thinks it&rsquo;s about Tyrion and resents him from the get go because he looks so ugly. Given GRRM&rsquo;s patterns, the audience thinks it will be Jaime because he was born a few seconds after her. But they overlook that she underestimates the people that surround her and her lack of respect and love for them and the collateral damage she creates in her wake.&nbsp;</p><p>It could be the Hound but the act of choking implies a kind of personal anger at the person, like Tyrion strangling Shae to death.&nbsp;</p><p>It could be Arya using the Strangler poison used on Joffrey, but she already has her on her list and Arya&rsquo;s journey is meant to push her towards walking away from her coping mechanism of revenge as justice.&nbsp;</p><p>What the audience doesn&rsquo;t think about is Bran. It&rsquo;s noteworthy that Cersei doesn&rsquo;t think of him either in her walk of shame even when she sees Tywin, Melara, Ned, Sansa, Lady, Tyrion and Joffrey.&nbsp;</p><p><i>&ldquo;The queen began to see familiar faces. A bald man with bushy side-whiskers frowned down from a window with her father&rsquo;s frown, and <b>for an instant looked so much like Lord Tywin</b> that she stumbled. A young girl sat beneath a fountain, drenched in spray, and stared at her with <b>Melara Hetherspoon&rsquo;s accusing eyes</b>. She saw <b>Ned Stark, and beside him little Sansa with her auburn hair and a shaggy grey dog that might have been her wolf</b>. Every child squirming through the crowd became <b>her brother Tyrion</b>, jeering at her as he had jeered when Joffrey died. And <b>there was Joff as well, her son</b>, her firstborn, her beautiful bright boy with his golden curls and his sweet smile, he had such lovely lips, he &hellip;</i>&rdquo; - Cersei II, ADWD<br /></p><p>To her credit, Cersei didn&rsquo;t want Jaime to push him off the First Keep. But she did want Jaime to hunt down Arya and kill her after she set Nymeria on Joffrey. If Bran spoke up, I doubt that she would hesitate. It&rsquo;s also worth noting that Cersei still sees Ned beside Sansa and Lady, who she wanted to spare if he lied about being a traitor and took the black. It&rsquo;s Joffrey that went against all their plans the last minute. So not seeing Bran here makes his absence stick out jarringly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>She also doesn&rsquo;t regret how she treated Tyrion or Sansa or the people around her. She doesn&rsquo;t recognise her and her family&rsquo;s abuse but rather sees it as a kindness because she could&rsquo;ve treated her worse as her hostage.&nbsp;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Your Grace has forgotten the Lady Sansa,&rdquo; said Pycelle.The queen bristled.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I most certainly have not forgotten that little she-wolf.&rdquo; She refused to say the girl&rsquo;s name. &ldquo;I ought to have shown her to the black cells as the daughter of a traitor, but instead I made her part of mine own household. She shared my hearth and hall, played with my own children. <b>I fed her, dressed her, tried to make her a little less ignorant about the world, and how did she repay me for my kindness? </b>She helped murder my son. When we find the Imp, we will find the Lady Sansa too. <b>She is not dead &hellip; but before I am done with her, I promise you, she will be singing to the Stranger, begging for his kiss</b>.&rdquo;</i> - Cersei IV, AFFC<br /></p><p>&nbsp;She only had love for her children, her father and Jaime. She loses all of them and drives even Jaime away. So it makes sense that the last knight and champion she has will turn against her as well. But as said, he is the Hound&rsquo;s older brother.&nbsp;</p><p>If Bran were to pull off this act, it would be the darkest one he has done so far as it would require choking her with two hands. I don&rsquo;t think Bran would do it merely for revenge though. The desire to protect might push him and considering Sansa is the one who developed the longest relationship with Cersei, it may be about her.&nbsp;</p><h2><b>Monsters and Knights</b></h2><p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that Cersei also seems to relate the valonqar to a monster and she often describes Tyrion as &ldquo;twisted little brother&rdquo; or &ldquo;twisted little monsters&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p><p><i>&ldquo;<b>And when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you</b>.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;<b>What is a valonqar? Some monster?</b>&rdquo; The golden girl did not like that foretelling.</i>&nbsp;- Cersei VIII, AFFC</p><p> &ldquo;<i>I am dreaming still, Cersei thought. I have not woken, nor has my nightmare ended. Tyrion will creep out from under the bed soon and begin to laugh at me. But that was folly. Her dwarf brother was down in the black cells, condemned to die this very day. She looked down at her hands, turning them over to make certain all her fingers were still there. When she ran a hand down her arm the skin was covered with gooseprickles, but unbroken. There were no cuts on her legs, no gashes on the soles of her feet. A dream, that&rsquo;s all it was, a dream. I drank too much last night, these fears are only humors born of wine. I will be the one laughing, come dusk. My children will be safe, Tommen&rsquo;s throne will be secure, and <b>my twisted little valonqar will be short a head and rotting</b>.</i>&rdquo; - Cersei I, AFFC</p><p>&ldquo;<i>She had never truly believed that he was harboring the Imp. Her <b>twisted little brother</b> was too clever to allow Lollys to name her wretched ill-begotten bastard after him, knowing it was sure to draw the queen&rsquo;s wroth down upon her.</i>&rdquo; - Cersei VII, AFFC<br /></p><p><i>Cersei had never realized there were so many dwarfs. &ldquo;Is the whole world overrun with these <b>twisted little monsters</b>?&rdquo; she complained, whilst the last of the informers was being ushered out. &ldquo;How many of them can there be?&rdquo;</i> - Cersei VIII, AFFC<br /></p><p>Bran is also &ldquo;little&rdquo; given his age and the fact that he cannot walk. The word &ldquo;twisted&rdquo; is also used for Winterfell Bran and the heart tree. The roots of the heart tree are even described as &ldquo;a man&rsquo;s gnarled arms&rdquo; or&nbsp;&ldquo;as thick as a giant&rsquo;s legs&rdquo;. This matters because Bran is often related to trees.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>To a boy, Winterfell was a grey stone labyrinth of walls and towers and courtyards and tunnels spreading out in all directions. In the older parts of the castle, the halls slanted up and down so that you couldn&rsquo;t even be sure what floor you were on. The place had grown over the centuries like <b>some monstrous stone tree</b>, Maester Luwin told him once, and <b>its branches were gnarled and thick and twisted, its roots sunk deep into the earth</b>.</i>&rdquo; - Bran II, AGOT</p><p><i>&ldquo;<b>The roots were everywhere, twisting through earth and stone,</b> closing off some passages and holding up the roofs of others. All the color is gone, Bran realized suddenly. The world was black soil and white wood. <b>The heart tree at Winterfell had roots as thick around as a giant&rsquo;s legs</b>, but these were even thicker. And Bran had never seen so many of them. There must be a whole grove of weirwoods growing up above us</i>.&rdquo; - Bran II, ADWD<br /></p><p><i>&ldquo;Lord Eddard Stark sat upon a rock beside the deep black pool in the godswood, the pale <b>roots of the heart tree twisting around him like an old man&rsquo;s gnarled arms</b>.</i>&rdquo; - Bran III, ADWD<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Your brother Jon asked it of me. And I have a tender spot in my heart for <b>cripples and bastards and broken things</b>.</i>&rdquo; Tyrion Lannister placed a hand over his heart and grinned. - Bran IV, AGOT<br /></p><p>So there&rsquo;s a connection with the heart tree&rsquo;s immovable but twisted roots and Bran&rsquo;s lower limbs. There&rsquo;s also the fact that even Willas is described as&nbsp;&ldquo;twisted&rdquo; for having a bad leg.&nbsp;</p><p><i>&ldquo;My son Willas is an able lad,&rdquo; the man replied, refusing to take her perfectly good hint. &ldquo;<b>His leg may be twisted</b> but he has no want of wits.&rdquo;</i> - Cersei II, AFFC<br /></p><p>Bran is in turn caught in a dilemma of wanting to be a knight while people see him as &ldquo;broken&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Harrion Karstark, the oldest of Lord Rickard&rsquo;s sons, bowed, and his brothers after him, yet as they settled back in their places he heard the younger two talking in low voices, over the clatter of wine cups. \"&hellip; sooner die than live like that,&rdquo; muttered one, his father&rsquo;s namesake Eddard, and his brother Torrhen said likely <b>the boy was broken inside as well as out,</b> too craven to take his own life.</i></p><p><i><b>Broken, Bran thought bitterly as he clutched his knife. Is that what he was now? Bran the Broken?</b> &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be broken,&rdquo; he whispered fiercely to Maester Luwin, who&rsquo;d been seated to his right.<b> &ldquo;I want to be a knight.</b></i>&rdquo; - Bran VI, AGOT</p><p>People assume that Bran won&rsquo;t really get to be one beyond his fantasy battle related role, where they assume he will die or become part of the godhood forever, but I don&rsquo;t think people consider the subversion his story.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>One day I will be like him. The thought filled Bran with dread. Bad enough that he was broken, with his useless legs. <b>Was he doomed to lose the rest too, to spend all of his years with a weirwood growing in him and through him?</b> Lord Brynden drew his life from the tree, Leaf told them. He did not eat, he did not drink. He slept, he dreamed, he watched. <b>I was going to be a knight, Bran remembered. I used to run and climb and fight. It seemed a thousand years ago.</b></i></p><p><i>What was he now? Only Bran the broken boy, Brandon of House Stark, prince of a lost kingdom, lord of a burned castle, heir to ruins.<b> He had thought the three-eyed crow would be a sorcerer, a wise old wizard who could fix his legs, but that was some stupid child&rsquo;s dream, he realized now. </b>I am too old for such fancies, he told himself. A thousand eyes, a hundred skins, wisdom deep as the roots of ancient trees. <b>That was as good as being a knight. Almost as good, anyway.</b></i>&ldquo; - Bran III, ADWD<br /></p><p>It&rsquo;s not enough for Bran, even as he settles for it. But he might lose sight of this for a while, like the show. However, the threat to something he loves - his family - might bring him back. Jaime&rsquo;s last words to Bran were&nbsp;&ldquo;The things we do for love&rdquo;. Perhaps, he might find himself on the other end as even Ned thinks on Robert&rsquo;s deathbed&nbsp;&ldquo;The lies we tell for love&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p><p>As I mentioned before all the three&nbsp;&ldquo;shadows&rdquo; have been part of the kingsguard and that includes Robert Strong. Incidentally, Bran once dreamed of joining the kingsguard and wearing a white cloak.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;<i><b>Bran was going to be a knight himself someday, one of the Kingsguard. O</b>ld Nan said they were the finest swords in all the realm.<b> There were only seven of them, and they wore white armor</b> and had no wives or children, but lived only to serve the king. Bran knew all the stories. Their names were like music to him. Serwyn of the Mirror Shield. Ser Ryam Redwyne. Prince Aemon the Dragonknight. The twins Ser Erryk and Ser Arryk, who had died on one another&rsquo;s swords hundreds of years ago, when brother fought sister in the war the singers called the Dance of the Dragons. The White Bull, Gerold Hightower. Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning. Barristan the Bold.</i>&rdquo; - Bran II, AGOT<br /></p><p>So in the case that he found himself wanting to protect someone he loves, taking on Robert Strong&rsquo;s empty suit of armor might be a way.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>They continued down the serpentine and across a small sunken courtyard. Ser Dontos shoved open a heavy door and lit a taper. They were inside a long gallery. <b>Along the walls stood empty suits of armor,</b> dark and dusty, their helms crested with rows of scales that continued down their backs. <b>As they hurried past, the taper&rsquo;s light made the shadows of each scale stretch and twist. The hollow knights are turning into dragons, she thought.</b></i>&ldquo; - Sansa V, ASOS<br /></p><p><a href=\"https://www.quora.com/Could-Bran-warging-into-the-mountain-be-the-Valonqar\" target=\"_blank\">Sarah Nunn on Quora</a> has discussed how this would be narratively unsatisfying because Bran means little to Cersei as <i>Robb&rsquo;s</i> brother. True, it would be less satisfying than Cersei being killed by her own blood. However, considering Sansa was Cersei&rsquo;s longterm victim and someone she still holds a grudge against, if Bran were to intervene to defend her, there would be a narrative payoff. This would also go along with Sansa as the YMBQ theory (<a href=\"https://randomtvramblings.tumblr.com/post/171186545077/sansa-as-the-ymbq-pt-2-everything-cersei-holds\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>) and Maggy the Frog&rsquo;s prophecy possibly suggesting that the valonqar is her brother. Cersei never considers this possibility.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This would mean that Sansa would have to have a last encounter with Cersei. It would be understandable if people were skeptical about the idea. I was too for a while because of the issue of seeing Sansa in a disempowered position again. But when you think about it, by the end of the story, the tables would&rsquo;ve turned quite a lot as Cersei would be isolated and even if Sansa falls into her hands, that would be after she has reunited with her family and Jaime has pledged himself to her. That would be leverage in Sansa&rsquo;s hands to dangle in front of Cersei. Because killing or harming Sansa would mean alienating Jaime further away from herself but if she spared her there was a chance, Jaime might still take her back. This would also be a point in the story where it&rsquo;s possible Cersei&rsquo;s and Sansa&rsquo;s conversation in ACOK about love and fear may come into the mix.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Robert wanted to be loved. My brother Tyrion has the same disease. Do you want to be loved, Sansa?&ldquo;</i></p><p><i>\"Everyone wants to be loved.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I see flowering hasn&rsquo;t made you any brighter,&rdquo; said Cersei. &ldquo;Sansa, permit me to share a bit of womanly wisdom with you on this very special day. Love is poison. A sweet poison, yes, but it will kill you all the same.</i>&rdquo; - Sansa IV, ACOK<br /></p><p>Cersei was wrong, as Sansa proves through inspiring knightly honour in a number of characters like the Hound and Dontos by showing concern and understanding for them. Basically, it would be a point where the ideological difference between Ned&rsquo;s and Tywin&rsquo;s philosophies would be tested out and Cersei would find that she had built her own doom.&nbsp;</p><p>The question of how Jaime&rsquo;s fate ties to his misdeed with Bran at the beginning of the story is something I&rsquo;m still unsure of. Pledging himself to Catelyn&rsquo;s daughters would be part of that atonement, but bookwise he doesn&rsquo;t even think about Bran while thinking about his vows. That&rsquo;s one part of the story I&rsquo;ve never really been able to piece together and my guesses are shots in the dark there.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, there is a kind of poetry to a &ldquo;monster&rdquo; killing a beautiful queen, but the roles of good and evil being subverted. Though not by the character Cersei expects. It&rsquo;s by the monster she made and the little boy her family broke and it may all be for a girl she victimised.</p><p>I could be wrong and it could just as well be Jaime as she sees him as a reflection of herself in male form or it could be Arya as Jon&rsquo;s or Sansa&rsquo;s &ldquo;little sister&rdquo; as Valyrian is gender neutral. But I think it&rsquo;s important that what happened with Bran and Sansa will come back to haunt the Lannisters again. Most people might&rsquo;ve forgotten it, especially what happened to Bran, but that&rsquo;s where the story begun and has yet to be resolved. There needs to be personal catharsis to Bran&rsquo;s arc beyond just his choice to help in saving humanity. He has his trauma too.&nbsp;</p></p>",

But then I came across <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sansannister/status/1091864822864637953\" target=\"_blank\">another post</a>, which postulated that the Mountain/Robert Strong will be the one to kill Cersei as Jaime leaving her with him parallels Rhaella leaving Aerys II with Jaime.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But if valonqar means &ldquo;little brother&rdquo;, Gregor&nbsp;&ldquo;the Hound&rdquo; Clegane is the older brother to Sandor&nbsp;&ldquo;the Hound&rdquo; Clegane. Bran, however, is still Sansa&rsquo;s younger brother, who all the Lannisters have some sort of relationship with - directly or indirectly. There&rsquo;s also a lot of &ldquo;monster&rdquo; imagery attached to the valonqar and being a cripple, Bran would fit the subversion of the notion.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>The Three Shadows</b></h2>\n<p>From the books and show we know that he could warg into a human or a more difficult being from his experience with Hodor, who was also incidentally considered a giant. But more than that, there is a certain instance in AGOT, that has the most crucial evidence for this theory.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;<i>He looked south, and saw the great blue-green rush of the Trident. He saw his father pleading with the king, his face etched with grief. </i>He saw Sansa crying herself to sleep at night, and he saw Arya watching in silence and holding her secrets hard in her heart. <b>There were shadows all around them. </b><i><b>One shadow was dark as ash, with the terrible face of a hound. Another was armored like the sun, golden and beautiful. Over them both loomed a giant in armor made of stone, but when he opened his visor, there was nothing inside but darkness and thick black blood.</b></i>&rdquo; - Bran III, AGOT<br /></p>\n</p>",

        "answer": "<p>Yes. Apart from Robb, Bran is the Stark whose presence is strongest in Theon\u2019s arc. Bran was the Stark in Winterfell\u00a0 when Theon took it and he witnessed Theon at his lowest. Theon hurt people Bran loved like maester Luwin and in the show Rodrick. Bran spoke to Theon through the weirwood tree which helped Theon break past the Reek persona. The show has replaced Bran\u2019s presence in Theon\u2019s life with Jon and Sansa because the show ableist trash to both Bran and Theon. I love Theon and Sansa scenes a lot but the show has had a habit of reducing Bran\u2019s importance from his powers, his connection to the Others/Night King, Winterfell and his family. I do think Bran and Theon will meet again in both canons but D&amp;D won\u2019t do it any justice.</p><p>As for the books, Bran will stop Stannis from executing Theon. This to me is the biggest proof that Bran will not pass the sentence and kill Theon for his crimes. In fact if Theon goes to the Iron Islands to render the Kingsmoot, well moot, then it\u2019ll be because Bran tells him what Euron is doing. Maybe I\u2019m being sappy because they are two of my favourite characters apart from Sansa, Catelyn and Cersei but I do think Bran will forgive Theon and give him both peace and purpose. Yes, Theon hurt Bran greatly but I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ll love it if Bran said,\u00a0\u201cDespite everything, I forgive you.\u201d If Bran does execute Theon, I\u2019ll be sad but not angry.</p>",
