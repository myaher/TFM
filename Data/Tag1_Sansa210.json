        "question": "hello again wonderful cutie, I want to do some Dany/Sansa/Arya having a good time fanart, what are some activities I could draw them doing? the only thing that comes to mind is having tea but I don't know much about how they would pass their time or company. Hope the wrist is better, have a nice day!",
        "answer": "<p>Here\u2019s <a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Customs#Pastimes\">a good list of pastimes</a>, some of which may be harder to draw than others I\u2019m afraid. But tea is good &ndash; playing cyvasse is also good (Arya might be fascinated or frustrated by the strategy), or tiles (dominoes), or other table games like that. Hawking is fun (Catelyn promised Arya she could have her own hawk when she was older), though not sure if Dany might get interrupted by a dragon snatching her prey. ;)\u00a0 Another option could be watching plays or performers, something non-offensive; or heck, Arya could perform while Sansa sings and plays, something like that. <br/></p><p>And oh, if they\u2019re in Winterfell, bathing in the hot pools could be a fun time &ndash; those are in the godswood, near the wall of the castle, I imagine when noble ladies are using them they probably encircle the area with sheets or something. But <a href=\"http://nobodysuspectsthebutterfly.tumblr.com/post/176951791858/do-westerosi-have-swimming-as-a-pastime-are-there\">Sansa and Arya grew up swimming in the pools</a>, and we all know Dany loves hot baths, so that could be perfect, yeah? Anyway, hope you find something you like!<br/></p>",
