She had a previously planned girls night out with a few of her coworkers that she didn\u2019t want to cancel on. <i>Oh well, at least I made it</i>, she thought as she smoothed out her dress and made her way down the long street.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"672\" data-orig-height=\"595\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/023b9e11febd622633f7cb51a135b945/tumblr_inline_po651nmZij1unegji_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"672\" data-orig-height=\"595\"/></figure><p>\u201cSansa! Sansa, you are late! It\u2019s my birthday and you are late,\u201d a drunk Theon shouted when he spotted her coming through the front door. He ran up to her, threw his arm around her shoulders and walked her in, his face close enough to hers where she could smell the alcohol on his breath.\u00a0\u201cWhy are you so late?\u201c<br/></p><p>\u201cI told you, birthday boy, I had previous plans with my coworkers and you only just told me last night about your party.\u201c<br/></p><p>\u201cWhere are your lady friends? You can make up your lateness to me by bringing your lady friends.\u201c<br/></p><p>\u201cThey went home, Theon, I\u2019m sorry.\u201c<br/></p><p>\u201cWell let\u2019s get you drunk!\u201c<br/></p><p>\u201cSorry, that isn\u2019t happening either, I have my car here so I gotta drive home.\u201c<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat? No, no, no. You can stay the night here with me!\u201c<br/></p><p>\u201cStop pestering my sister, Greyjoy,\u201c Robb called out and rescued Sansa from Theon\u2019s drunkenness by steering her towards his girlfriend Margaery.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cThanks, Robb,\u201d Sansa said gratefully as they walked away and Theon turned his attention to some other girls.</p><p>\u201cNo prob. I\u2019m glad I got to say hi to you before Marg and I take off.\u201c<br/></p><p>\u201cAw, you\u2019re leaving me already?\u201c<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah, we gotta get up early for brunch with my grandma,\u201c Margaery said.\u00a0\u201cSorry, Sans. Arya\u2019s still around here somewhere though. And Jon,\u201c she said with an obvious wink.<br/></p><p>\u201cOh God, you\u2019re not still crushing on him are you, Sans?\u201c\u00a0\n\nRobb asked with a raised eyebrow.\n\n<br/></p><p>\u201cShhh! I\u2019m not \u2018crushing on him\u2019, Robb,\u201c Sansa said quietly and punched his arm while giving Margaery a warning look. She said goodbye to them and went off to find her little sister Arya.<br/></p><p>Sansa always had a bit of a crush on her brother\u2019s best friend. He was always around when they were growing up and Jon was older, independent, sometimes aloof and broody, and completely different than the spoiled rich kids in her class. Instead of fawning over him like her friends did with their consistently changing crushes, Sansa tried to put on an air of sophistication and mystery in hopes it made her seem more mature than the other girls her age. Arya would tell her she was acting like a stuck up snob but Sansa didn\u2019t realize that until she got to college and started to act like herself. Now she was 25. A few boyfriends came and went, some bad, some decent. But she still kept her feelings for Jon. He was now one of her good friends. She had to sit through his relationship with the wild and crazy Ygritte, which lasted about six months. But then, the following New Year\u2019s Eve, the Starks threw a party at their house and they were all pretty drunk. Right as it turned midnight and everybody was cheering or kissing, Jon grabbed Sansa\u2019s face and kissed her. She could taste the alcohol on his lips just as he could probably taste hers and it wasn\u2019t as graceful as a sober kiss could be, but it still made Sansa\u2019s heart flutter. She went to sleep that night hopeful of what may come out of it. But nothing did, it was like Jon had been so drunk that he didn\u2019t even remember kissing her. And Sansa didn\u2019t want to embarrass herself by bringing it up to him when it obviously meant nothing besides a drunk and friendly New Year\u2019s kiss. That was four months ago and Sansa could still feel his full lips on hers.</p><p>Sansa found Arya talking with their friend Brienne and joined in their conversation. Not long after, a happy-drunk Jon came bounding over, stood behind Sansa and wrapped his arm around the front of her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cSansa, you made it!\u201c he exclaimed and kissed the top of her head.<br/></p><p>\u201cHi, Jon, you seem very happy,\u201c Sansa said with a laugh, relishing their physical closeness.<br/></p><p>\u201cOf course I am! We barbecued some yummy food, I\u2019ve had plenty of my trusty Jameson, all our friends are here, and you\u2019ve now graced us with your loveliness!\u201c<br/></p><p>After a while, Arya and Brienne decided to leave. Sansa looked around and realized it was mostly Theon\u2019s old fraternity friends left so she found Jon to tell him she was going to head home too.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I was just gonna order up an Uber home,\u201c Jon said, feeling his pockets to find his phone.\u00a0\u201cShit. I went to Robb\u2019s place before this and we drove together. My house keys are still at his apartment.\u201d He pulled out his phone and called Robb. \u201cHmmm, he\u2019s not answering, they must be asleep.\u201d Jon then looked at her with puppy dog eyes that made her giggle.\u00a0\u201cSansa, can I crash at your place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, you don\u2019t want to stay the night with Theon?\u201c she teased.<br/></p><p>\u201cDear God, no! I barely tolerate sober Theon, drunk Theon is the worst.\u201c<br/></p><p>\u201cOf course you can stay with me,\u201c Sansa laughed.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou sure? I\u2019m not imposing upon you or anything?\u201c<br/></p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m sure, it\u2019s no problem.\u201c They walked out the front door and into a warm spring rain.\u00a0\u201cWell damn, of course my car is parked far away,\u201c Sansa said, pointing in the direction of where she parked.<br/></p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201c Jon took her hand and they ran, laughing up the street. When they finally hopped into her car, their clothes were soaked. As she drove them to her apartment, Jon rested his hand on her thigh and turned his body to face towards her. She glanced over at him and he had a goofy look on his face and his eyes were trying to stay focused on her.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really pretty.\u201c<br/></p><p>\u201cRandom, but thanks,\u201c she replied with a little laugh</p><p>\u201cLike more than pretty. You\u2019re fucking gorgeous. Devastatingly beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Jon,\u201d she said shyly, highly aware of his hand running up and down her thigh. Within 15 minutes, she pulled into her parking spot at her apartment complex. \u201cOkay, we\u2019re gonna have to make a break for it through the rain again.\u201d</p><p>\u201c1, 2, 3, go!\u201d Jon exclaimed. They jumped out of the car and Jon once again took her hand as they ran for her door.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I have a pair of Robb\u2019s sweatpants that I stole from him. You can wear that and I\u2019ll put your clothes in the dryer,\u201c Sansa said once they were inside.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou stole Robb\u2019s sweatpants? Ooooo, I\u2019m gonna snitch on you!\u201c Jon said, immediately taking of his shirt and revealing his impeccable body.<br/></p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t! He thinks he lost them and they\u2019re just so dang comfortable,\u201c she said, pulling them out of her drawer and throwing them to Jon. He went into the master bathroom to change and when he came back out, she took his clothes and popped them in the dryer. She took her turn in the bathroom to change into her pajamas and wash her face. When she came back into the bedroom, Jon was sitting on her bed and scrolling through his phone. <i>Oh God, where should I suggest he sleep? Is it too obvious if I tell him he can share my bed?</i> she thought to herself. He looked up at her as she strode into the room.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"672\" data-orig-height=\"479\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e79d34a9422f83dda6bbd379ec9f06d9/tumblr_inline_po64201nYh1unegji_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"672\" data-orig-height=\"479\"/></figure><p>\u201cSansa, you\u2019re just the best. Come sit with me,\u201c his speech was still slightly slurred as he grabbed her hand and pulled her onto the bed next to him.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the best too, drunky.\u201c<br/></p><p>\u201cWhy are you so sexy?\u201c Jon asked, pushing a few strands of her hair behind her ear.<br/></p><p>\u201cJon, I\u2019m in pajamas and there\u2019s nothing on my face, there\u2019s nothing sexy happening right now,\u201c she laughed.<br/></p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re always sexy, no matter what you\u2019re wearing. You\u2019re perfect, it\u2019s just a fact.\u201c<br/></p><p><i>Is this just the alcohol talking?</i> Sansa thought to herself.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201c Jon said, picking up his phone and scrolling through a Spotify playlist with the simple title of\u00a0\u201cS\u201d. Once he selected a song, the opening tunes of\u00a0\u201cI Want Some More\u201d by Dan Auerbach began to play. Jon suddenly got up and stood in front of Sansa.\u00a0\u201cThis song is about you, Sans. This is what you do to me.\u201d He began to roll his pelvis to the music towards her. Sansa\u2019s mouth dropped.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the name of Magic Mike is happening right now? Where am I? Who are you? You\u2019re not Jon Snow,\u201c she laughed while appreciating his shirtless body dancing sexually towards her.<br/></p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, fine, I\u2019m not a dancer,\u201c he said, giving up and sitting back down next to her.<br/></p><p>\u201cI mean&hellip;you weren\u2019t terrible. But what\u2019s happening right now? Why are you saying this song is about me?\u201c<br/></p><p>\u201cBecause your sweet lips are really like nothing I\u2019ve ever tasted before and I want more of it,\u201c Jon said, his already alcohol-flushed face turning more red.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou remember that kiss?\u201c Sansa asked, surprised.<br/></p><p>\u201cOf course I do, it was only the best moment ever!\u201c<br/></p><p>\u201cSo then why didn\u2019t you say anything about it after that night? I thought you were so drunk that you didn\u2019t remember you did that.\u201c<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a coward. I had to get that drunk just to get the balls to do it that night.\u201c<br/></p><p>\u201cAnd now you want more? Is this just the alcohol talking? You wanna hook up whenever you\u2019re drunk?\u201d Sansa asked, trying not to feel slightly hurt by the notion.</p><p>\u201cNo. Not just when I\u2019m drunk. All the time, Sans.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve never said anything.\u201c<br/></p><p>\u201cLike I said, I\u2019m a coward. The alcohol makes me brave enough to do something about it. But when I\u2019m sober, I\u2019m too shy to talk to you about it or ask you out. You\u2019re perfect, Sansa. Just like the song says, everything you\u2019ve got is just what I always wanted. Right down to a T, nothing about you that don\u2019t please me.\u201d He sang the lines with the song as he took her hands in his, making Sansa giggle.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you felt like that?\u201c<br/></p><p>\u201cSince we were kids,\u201c Jon answered sheepishly.<br/></p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201c<br/></p><p>\u201cYes way. So, tell me, am I just making a fool out of myself here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean you did try to Magic Mike me and I won\u2019t ever let you live that down. But I\u2019ve actually had feelings for you since we were kids too.\u201c<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201c<br/></p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201c<br/></p><p>\u201cBut you seemed like you didn\u2019t want anything to do with me until we actually became friends when you got older.\u201c<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah, that was my attempt to act cool and mature. It really did come off as bitchiness, didn\u2019t it?\u201c Sansa laughed.<br/></p><p>\u201cIt was&hellip;an endearing bitchiness,\u201d Jon joked.\u00a0\u201cSo&hellip;do you still feel the same way about me?\u201c<br/></p><p>\u201cIt never went away,\u201c she said slowly.\u00a0\u201cUgh, this isn\u2019t fair that I\u2019m talking about this sober while you get to be drunk!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cSo let me get this straight&hellip;I like you&hellip;you like me&hellip;I think we should do something about that.\u201c Jon\u2019s eyes were on her lips and his hand went up and entwined in her hair.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve waited so long to make you feel good.\u201d Her body slightly quivered in anticipation. This was what Sansa wanted, for all of her feelings to be out in the open, to know that Jon felt the same way, to taste his lips on hers again. <i>No, not like this,</i> Sansa suddenly thought.<br/></p><p>\u201cWait,\u201c she whispered. His lips were so close to hers and she wanted them so bad. She leaned her forehead against his and closed her eyes.\u00a0\u201cI want this. More than anything. But I need to know you feel the same way when you\u2019re not drunk. It\u2019s just that you seem more drunk tonight than you were on New Year\u2019s Eve, and you couldn\u2019t even acknowledge the kiss afterwards. What if you don\u2019t even remember all of this tomorrow? You danced for me, that\u2019s how drunk you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can promise you I\u2019ll feel the exact same way when I\u2019m sober and I\u2019ll wish I could forget my dancing act,\u201c Jon laughed.\u00a0\u201cBut I get it, Sans,\u201d he said and placed a light kiss on the tip of her nose.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll prove it to you tomorrow and I\u2019m gonna make sure you feel good.\u201d Sansa smiled and bit her lip.\u00a0\u201cGod, you don\u2019t even know what you do to me!\u201c<br/></p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go to sleep, Magic Mike,\u201c Sansa teased as she laid back on her bed and pulled him down with her.<br/></p><p>\u201cPlease, please don\u2019t tell anyone about that!\u201c Jon laughed as they got under the covers.</p><p>\u201cFine. But expect me to make fun of you for it in private.\u201c<br/></p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201c\u00a0</p><p>Sansa faced away from him but nestled her back against his chest while he draped his arm over her and pulled her closer.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve wanted exactly this for so long,\u201d Jon said sleepily. Sansa drifted off to sleep with a smile on her face.</p><p>The next morning, she woke up and realized they had stayed in the same position throughout the night. She smiled to herself as she heard his soft snores behind her. But that smile soon turned to nerves. <i>What if he\u2019s just a horny drunk?</i> she thought. She carefully slid out of bed so she wouldn\u2019t wake him up and took a shower. When she was done, she threw on her little robe and quietly opened the bathroom door to the bedroom. She found Jon awake, sitting up in her bed and rubbing his eyes.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"672\" data-orig-height=\"611\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0bb84f3b8cba5c4d6bb6eacfdb0528d9/tumblr_inline_po63fltiZx1unegji_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"672\" data-orig-height=\"611\"/></figure><p>\u201cHow\u2019re you feeling, big guy?\u201c Sansa teased as she bushed out her hair.</p><p>\u201cNot too bad, surprisingly. Just in desperate need of mouthwash.\u201c<br/></p><p>\u201cMedicine cabinet,\u201c Sansa said with a smile.<br/></p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201c Jon said and went to the bathroom. When he was done, he stood in the doorway and leaned against it.\u00a0\u201cSo. I danced for you.\u201c<br/></p><p>\u201cThat is a fact, yes,\u201d Sansa laughed. <i>Okay, he remembers things. But does he really feel the way he said he does? Moment of truth,\u00a0</i>Sansa thought nervously.<br/></p><p>\u201cSans, I meant every word I said last night,\u201d he said, his voice shy as he looked at her.\u00a0\u201cYou really are perfect and you really are everything I\u2019ve ever wanted. For me, that song really was about you. I wish I wasn\u2019t so embarrassing about it, but it is what it is,\u201c he said with a nervous laugh.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sure I wasn\u2019t all that eloquent last night. But not only are you sexy and devastatingly beautiful, you\u2019re the sweetest person I know, you just want to take care of people and make sure they\u2019re happy, you\u2019re smart and creative, you know how to take care of yourself and you\u2019re great at your job. You\u2019re you and it\u2019s perfect.\u201c</p><p>\u201cJon -\u201c Sansa was nearly speechless.<br/></p><p>\u201cOkay, this is going to be embarrassing for me,\u201c he said and crossed the room to grab his phone. He once again opened Spotify and pulled up the same\u00a0\u201cS\u201c playlist.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve had this for a long time now. Constantly adding songs I hear that make me think of you.\u201c He handed the phone to her as she leaned against her dresser.</p><p>\u201cS is for Sansa?\u201c she asked, looking over at him as he watched her nervously and sat on the edge of the bed. She gave a quick scroll through the playlist, spotting songs she knew and some she didn\u2019t.\u00a0There was \u201cI Found You\u201c and \u201cBe Mine\u201c by Alabama Shakes.\n\nA few Black Keys songs like \u201cEverlasting Light\u201c, \u201cThe Only One\u201c, \u201cGirl Is On My Mind\u201c, and \u201cYour Touch\u201d. Another song by Dan Auerbach called\u00a0\u201cNever In My Wildest Dreams.\u201c\u00a0\u00a0The list went on and on but as soon as she spotted \u201cI Want Some More\u201d, she clicked play and put the phone down. She looked over at Jon with a sly smile and bit her lip.\u00a0 She came to him, leaned down and pressed her lips to his. The kiss was full and passionate and she could hear a small, relieved sigh escape Jon\u2019s mouth.<br/></p><p>\u201cSo, you want some more of this?\u201c Sansa teased after she pulled away.<br/></p><p>\u201cI want more of everything with you,\u201c he whispered, his hands grazing the sides of her body until they came to a rest on her hips.\u00a0\u201cCan I take you out to dinner tonight?\u201c<br/></p><p>Sansa smiled and nodded. She then started swaying her hips to the music.\u00a0\u201cSince you gave me a little taste of your moves last night, maybe it\u2019s only fair that I give you a taste of my own.\u201d She peeled Jon\u2019s hands off her hips and turned around, still swaying her body to the music. She slowly lowered until she was very lightly grinding her ass on Jon\u2019s lap.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Jon\u2019s voice was filled with awe and need. Sansa turned around again, put a knee on either side of him on the bed and straddled his lap. His hands grabbed at her hips and pulled her closer. He looked up into her face and she bit her lip again. Jon let out a sexy groan and covered her lips with his. As he pulled away from the kiss, he lightly bit her lower lip and pulled at it.\u00a0\u201cI believe last night I told you I\u2019m going to make you feel good today.\u201c<br/></p><p>\u201cYes, you definitely did say that,\u201c Sansa whispered into his ear as she licked and nibbled his earlobe.<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only right that I make good on that promise.\u201c<br/></p><p>\u201cBy all means,\u201c she said breathlessly, feeling Jon\u2019s hand skim lightly over the fabric covering her breast. His thumb traced circles around her hard nipple.\u00a0\u201cPlease,\u201c Sansa quietly pleaded. Jon planted kisses from her neck and down the middle of her chest where the robe didn\u2019t cover. When he got to the sliver of skin between her breasts, Sansa felt his hands slowly sliding the robe off her shoulders. His hand covered one breast while he licked, sucked, and nibbled at the other. Sansa\u2019s back arched as she moaned, she could feel herself getting wetter on Jon\u2019s lap.<br/></p><p>All of a sudden, Jon\u2019s hands grabbed her ass, he stood up with her, and swiftly laid her on the bed. He laid next to her, propped up on his elbow and, kissed her lips, along her jaw, and down her neck.\u00a0\u201cI need to taste more of you,\u201d he said in a low voice. Sansa entwined her hand into his hair and pulled his lips to hers as she spread her legs open. Jon\u2019s hand traveled down her chest, untied her robe and pushed it open. His hand gently caressed her between her legs, making Sansa moan into his mouth. Jon smiled his small, sexy smile at her and moved down her body. He licked her up with a hunger and desire as Sansa moaned and screamed and called out his name until she came apart.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, Jon,\u201c Sansa panted as he kissed his way up her body.\u00a0\u201cI feel like I can\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201c he smiled.\u00a0\u201cBut I\u2019m sorry to break it to you, you gotta move. We need to go get my keys from Robb\u2019s place before they go off to brunch.\u201c<br/></p><p>\u201cMmmmm, but what about you?\u201c Sansa sultrily said as she grazed her hands down his abs and over his sweatpants covered crotch.<br/></p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he muttered and closed his eyes. \u201cI need a shower, preferably a cold one. How about we continue this after our first ever date tonight?\u201c<br/></p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201c Sansa smiled.\u00a0<br/></p>",

She had a previously planned girls night out with a few of her coworkers that she didn\u2019t want to cancel on. <i>Oh well, at least I made it</i>, she thought as she smoothed out her dress and made her way down the long street.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"672\" data-orig-height=\"595\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/023b9e11febd622633f7cb51a135b945/tumblr_inline_po651nmZij1unegji_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"672\" data-orig-height=\"595\"></figure><p>\u201cSansa! Sansa, you are late! It\u2019s my birthday and you are late,\u201d a drunk Theon shouted when he spotted her coming through the front door. He ran up to her, threw his arm around her shoulders and walked her in, his face close enough to hers where she could smell the alcohol on his breath.\u00a0\u201cWhy are you so late?\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cI told you, birthday boy, I had previous plans with my coworkers and you only just told me last night about your party.\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cWhere are your lady friends? You can make up your lateness to me by bringing your lady friends.\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cThey went home, Theon, I\u2019m sorry.\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cWell let\u2019s get you drunk!\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cSorry, that isn\u2019t happening either, I have my car here so I gotta drive home.\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cWhat? No, no, no. You can stay the night here with me!\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cStop pestering my sister, Greyjoy,\u201c Robb called out and rescued Sansa from Theon\u2019s drunkenness by steering her towards his girlfriend Margaery.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThanks, Robb,\u201d Sansa said gratefully as they walked away and Theon turned his attention to some other girls.</p><p>\u201cNo prob. I\u2019m glad I got to say hi to you before Marg and I take off.\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cAw, you\u2019re leaving me already?\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, we gotta get up early for brunch with my grandma,\u201c Margaery said.\u00a0\u201cSorry, Sans. Arya\u2019s still around here somewhere though. And Jon,\u201c she said with an obvious wink.<br></p><p>\u201cOh God, you\u2019re not still crushing on him are you, Sans?\u201c\u00a0\n\nRobb asked with a raised eyebrow.\n\n<br></p><p>\u201cShhh! I\u2019m not \u2018crushing on him\u2019, Robb,\u201c Sansa said quietly and punched his arm while giving Margaery a warning look. She said goodbye to them and went off to find her little sister Arya.<br></p><p>Sansa always had a bit of a crush on her brother\u2019s best friend. He was always around when they were growing up and Jon was older, independent, sometimes aloof and broody, and completely different than the spoiled rich kids in her class. Instead of fawning over him like her friends did with their consistently changing crushes, Sansa tried to put on an air of sophistication and mystery in hopes it made her seem more mature than the other girls her age. Arya would tell her she was acting like a stuck up snob but Sansa didn\u2019t realize that until she got to college and started to act like herself. Now she was 25. A few boyfriends came and went, some bad, some decent. But she still kept her feelings for Jon. He was now one of her good friends. She had to sit through his relationship with the wild and crazy Ygritte, which lasted about six months. But then, the following New Year\u2019s Eve, the Starks threw a party at their house and they were all pretty drunk. Right as it turned midnight and everybody was cheering or kissing, Jon grabbed Sansa\u2019s face and kissed her. She could taste the alcohol on his lips just as he could probably taste hers and it wasn\u2019t as graceful as a sober kiss could be, but it still made Sansa\u2019s heart flutter. She went to sleep that night hopeful of what may come out of it. But nothing did, it was like Jon had been so drunk that he didn\u2019t even remember kissing her. And Sansa didn\u2019t want to embarrass herself by bringing it up to him when it obviously meant nothing besides a drunk and friendly New Year\u2019s kiss. That was four months ago and Sansa could still feel his full lips on hers.</p><p>Sansa found Arya talking with their friend Brienne and joined in their conversation. Not long after, a happy-drunk Jon came bounding over, stood behind Sansa and wrapped his arm around the front of her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cSansa, you made it!\u201c he exclaimed and kissed the top of her head.<br></p><p>\u201cHi, Jon, you seem very happy,\u201c Sansa said with a laugh, relishing their physical closeness.<br></p><p>\u201cOf course I am! We barbecued some yummy food, I\u2019ve had plenty of my trusty Jameson, all our friends are here, and you\u2019ve now graced us with your loveliness!\u201c<br></p><p>After a while, Arya and Brienne decided to leave. Sansa looked around and realized it was mostly Theon\u2019s old fraternity friends left so she found Jon to tell him she was going to head home too.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I was just gonna order up an Uber home,\u201c Jon said, feeling his pockets to find his phone.\u00a0\u201cShit. I went to Robb\u2019s place before this and we drove together. My house keys are still at his apartment.\u201d He pulled out his phone and called Robb. \u201cHmmm, he\u2019s not answering, they must be asleep.\u201d Jon then looked at her with puppy dog eyes that made her giggle.\u00a0\u201cSansa, can I crash at your place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, you don\u2019t want to stay the night with Theon?\u201c she teased.<br></p><p>\u201cDear God, no! I barely tolerate sober Theon, drunk Theon is the worst.\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cOf course you can stay with me,\u201c Sansa laughed.<br></p><p>\u201cYou sure? I\u2019m not imposing upon you or anything?\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m sure, it\u2019s no problem.\u201c They walked out the front door and into a warm spring rain.\u00a0\u201cWell damn, of course my car is parked far away,\u201c Sansa said, pointing in the direction of where she parked.<br></p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201c Jon took her hand and they ran, laughing up the street. When they finally hopped into her car, their clothes were soaked. As she drove them to her apartment, Jon rested his hand on her thigh and turned his body to face towards her. She glanced over at him and he had a goofy look on his face and his eyes were trying to stay focused on her.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really pretty.\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cRandom, but thanks,\u201c she replied with a little laugh</p><p>\u201cLike more than pretty. You\u2019re fucking gorgeous. Devastatingly beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Jon,\u201d she said shyly, highly aware of his hand running up and down her thigh. Within 15 minutes, she pulled into her parking spot at her apartment complex. \u201cOkay, we\u2019re gonna have to make a break for it through the rain again.\u201d</p><p>\u201c1, 2, 3, go!\u201d Jon exclaimed. They jumped out of the car and Jon once again took her hand as they ran for her door.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I have a pair of Robb\u2019s sweatpants that I stole from him. You can wear that and I\u2019ll put your clothes in the dryer,\u201c Sansa said once they were inside.<br></p><p>\u201cYou stole Robb\u2019s sweatpants? Ooooo, I\u2019m gonna snitch on you!\u201c Jon said, immediately taking of his shirt and revealing his impeccable body.<br></p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t! He thinks he lost them and they\u2019re just so dang comfortable,\u201c she said, pulling them out of her drawer and throwing them to Jon. He went into the master bathroom to change and when he came back out, she took his clothes and popped them in the dryer. She took her turn in the bathroom to change into her pajamas and wash her face. When she came back into the bedroom, Jon was sitting on her bed and scrolling through his phone. <i>Oh God, where should I suggest he sleep? Is it too obvious if I tell him he can share my bed?</i> she thought to herself. He looked up at her as she strode into the room.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"672\" data-orig-height=\"479\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e79d34a9422f83dda6bbd379ec9f06d9/tumblr_inline_po64201nYh1unegji_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"672\" data-orig-height=\"479\"></figure><p>\u201cSansa, you\u2019re just the best. Come sit with me,\u201c his speech was still slightly slurred as he grabbed her hand and pulled her onto the bed next to him.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the best too, drunky.\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cWhy are you so sexy?\u201c Jon asked, pushing a few strands of her hair behind her ear.<br></p><p>\u201cJon, I\u2019m in pajamas and there\u2019s nothing on my face, there\u2019s nothing sexy happening right now,\u201c she laughed.<br></p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re always sexy, no matter what you\u2019re wearing. You\u2019re perfect, it\u2019s just a fact.\u201c<br></p><p><i>Is this just the alcohol talking?</i> Sansa thought to herself.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201c Jon said, picking up his phone and scrolling through a Spotify playlist with the simple title of\u00a0\u201cS\u201d. Once he selected a song, the opening tunes of\u00a0\u201cI Want Some More\u201d by Dan Auerbach began to play. Jon suddenly got up and stood in front of Sansa.\u00a0\u201cThis song is about you, Sans. This is what you do to me.\u201d He began to roll his pelvis to the music towards her. Sansa\u2019s mouth dropped.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the name of Magic Mike is happening right now? Where am I? Who are you? You\u2019re not Jon Snow,\u201c she laughed while appreciating his shirtless body dancing sexually towards her.<br></p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, fine, I\u2019m not a dancer,\u201c he said, giving up and sitting back down next to her.<br></p><p>\u201cI mean\u2026you weren\u2019t terrible. But what\u2019s happening right now? Why are you saying this song is about me?\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cBecause your sweet lips are really like nothing I\u2019ve ever tasted before and I want more of it,\u201c Jon said, his already alcohol-flushed face turning more red.<br></p><p>\u201cYou remember that kiss?\u201c Sansa asked, surprised.<br></p><p>\u201cOf course I do, it was only the best moment ever!\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cSo then why didn\u2019t you say anything about it after that night? I thought you were so drunk that you didn\u2019t remember you did that.\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a coward. I had to get that drunk just to get the balls to do it that night.\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cAnd now you want more? Is this just the alcohol talking? You wanna hook up whenever you\u2019re drunk?\u201d Sansa asked, trying not to feel slightly hurt by the notion.</p><p>\u201cNo. Not just when I\u2019m drunk. All the time, Sans.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve never said anything.\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cLike I said, I\u2019m a coward. The alcohol makes me brave enough to do something about it. But when I\u2019m sober, I\u2019m too shy to talk to you about it or ask you out. You\u2019re perfect, Sansa. Just like the song says, everything you\u2019ve got is just what I always wanted. Right down to a T, nothing about you that don\u2019t please me.\u201d He sang the lines with the song as he took her hands in his, making Sansa giggle.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you felt like that?\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cSince we were kids,\u201c Jon answered sheepishly.<br></p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cYes way. So, tell me, am I just making a fool out of myself here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean you did try to Magic Mike me and I won\u2019t ever let you live that down. But I\u2019ve actually had feelings for you since we were kids too.\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cBut you seemed like you didn\u2019t want anything to do with me until we actually became friends when you got older.\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, that was my attempt to act cool and mature. It really did come off as bitchiness, didn\u2019t it?\u201c Sansa laughed.<br></p><p>\u201cIt was\u2026an endearing bitchiness,\u201d Jon joked.\u00a0\u201cSo\u2026do you still feel the same way about me?\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cIt never went away,\u201c she said slowly.\u00a0\u201cUgh, this isn\u2019t fair that I\u2019m talking about this sober while you get to be drunk!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSo let me get this straight\u2026I like you\u2026you like me\u2026I think we should do something about that.\u201c Jon\u2019s eyes were on her lips and his hand went up and entwined in her hair.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve waited so long to make you feel good.\u201d Her body slightly quivered in anticipation. This was what Sansa wanted, for all of her feelings to be out in the open, to know that Jon felt the same way, to taste his lips on hers again. <i>No, not like this,</i> Sansa suddenly thought.<br></p><p>\u201cWait,\u201c she whispered. His lips were so close to hers and she wanted them so bad. She leaned her forehead against his and closed her eyes.\u00a0\u201cI want this. More than anything. But I need to know you feel the same way when you\u2019re not drunk. It\u2019s just that you seem more drunk tonight than you were on New Year\u2019s Eve, and you couldn\u2019t even acknowledge the kiss afterwards. What if you don\u2019t even remember all of this tomorrow? You danced for me, that\u2019s how drunk you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can promise you I\u2019ll feel the exact same way when I\u2019m sober and I\u2019ll wish I could forget my dancing act,\u201c Jon laughed.\u00a0\u201cBut I get it, Sans,\u201d he said and placed a light kiss on the tip of her nose.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll prove it to you tomorrow and I\u2019m gonna make sure you feel good.\u201d Sansa smiled and bit her lip.\u00a0\u201cGod, you don\u2019t even know what you do to me!\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go to sleep, Magic Mike,\u201c Sansa teased as she laid back on her bed and pulled him down with her.<br></p><p>\u201cPlease, please don\u2019t tell anyone about that!\u201c Jon laughed as they got under the covers.</p><p>\u201cFine. But expect me to make fun of you for it in private.\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201c\u00a0</p><p>Sansa faced away from him but nestled her back against his chest while he draped his arm over her and pulled her closer.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve wanted exactly this for so long,\u201d Jon said sleepily. Sansa drifted off to sleep with a smile on her face.</p><p>The next morning, she woke up and realized they had stayed in the same position throughout the night. She smiled to herself as she heard his soft snores behind her. But that smile soon turned to nerves. <i>What if he\u2019s just a horny drunk?</i> she thought. She carefully slid out of bed so she wouldn\u2019t wake him up and took a shower. When she was done, she threw on her little robe and quietly opened the bathroom door to the bedroom. She found Jon awake, sitting up in her bed and rubbing his eyes.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"672\" data-orig-height=\"611\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0bb84f3b8cba5c4d6bb6eacfdb0528d9/tumblr_inline_po63fltiZx1unegji_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"672\" data-orig-height=\"611\"></figure><p>\u201cHow\u2019re you feeling, big guy?\u201c Sansa teased as she bushed out her hair.</p><p>\u201cNot too bad, surprisingly. Just in desperate need of mouthwash.\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cMedicine cabinet,\u201c Sansa said with a smile.<br></p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201c Jon said and went to the bathroom. When he was done, he stood in the doorway and leaned against it.\u00a0\u201cSo. I danced for you.\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cThat is a fact, yes,\u201d Sansa laughed. <i>Okay, he remembers things. But does he really feel the way he said he does? Moment of truth,\u00a0</i>Sansa thought nervously.<br></p><p>\u201cSans, I meant every word I said last night,\u201d he said, his voice shy as he looked at her.\u00a0\u201cYou really are perfect and you really are everything I\u2019ve ever wanted. For me, that song really was about you. I wish I wasn\u2019t so embarrassing about it, but it is what it is,\u201c he said with a nervous laugh.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sure I wasn\u2019t all that eloquent last night. But not only are you sexy and devastatingly beautiful, you\u2019re the sweetest person I know, you just want to take care of people and make sure they\u2019re happy, you\u2019re smart and creative, you know how to take care of yourself and you\u2019re great at your job. You\u2019re you and it\u2019s perfect.\u201c</p><p>\u201cJon -\u201c Sansa was nearly speechless.<br></p><p>\u201cOkay, this is going to be embarrassing for me,\u201c he said and crossed the room to grab his phone. He once again opened Spotify and pulled up the same\u00a0\u201cS\u201c playlist.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve had this for a long time now. Constantly adding songs I hear that make me think of you.\u201c He handed the phone to her as she leaned against her dresser.</p><p>\u201cS is for Sansa?\u201c she asked, looking over at him as he watched her nervously and sat on the edge of the bed. She gave a quick scroll through the playlist, spotting songs she knew and some she didn\u2019t.\u00a0There was \u201cI Found You\u201c and \u201cBe Mine\u201c by Alabama Shakes.\n\nA few Black Keys songs like \u201cEverlasting Light\u201c, \u201cThe Only One\u201c, \u201cGirl Is On My Mind\u201c, and \u201cYour Touch\u201d. Another song by Dan Auerbach called\u00a0\u201cNever In My Wildest Dreams.\u201c\u00a0\u00a0The list went on and on but as soon as she spotted \u201cI Want Some More\u201d, she clicked play and put the phone down. She looked over at Jon with a sly smile and bit her lip.\u00a0 She came to him, leaned down and pressed her lips to his. The kiss was full and passionate and she could hear a small, relieved sigh escape Jon\u2019s mouth.<br></p><p>\u201cSo, you want some more of this?\u201c Sansa teased after she pulled away.<br></p><p>\u201cI want more of everything with you,\u201c he whispered, his hands grazing the sides of her body until they came to a rest on her hips.\u00a0\u201cCan I take you out to dinner tonight?\u201c<br></p><p>Sansa smiled and nodded. She then started swaying her hips to the music.\u00a0\u201cSince you gave me a little taste of your moves last night, maybe it\u2019s only fair that I give you a taste of my own.\u201d She peeled Jon\u2019s hands off her hips and turned around, still swaying her body to the music. She slowly lowered until she was very lightly grinding her ass on Jon\u2019s lap.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Jon\u2019s voice was filled with awe and need. Sansa turned around again, put a knee on either side of him on the bed and straddled his lap. His hands grabbed at her hips and pulled her closer. He looked up into her face and she bit her lip again. Jon let out a sexy groan and covered her lips with his. As he pulled away from the kiss, he lightly bit her lower lip and pulled at it.\u00a0\u201cI believe last night I told you I\u2019m going to make you feel good today.\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cYes, you definitely did say that,\u201c Sansa whispered into his ear as she licked and nibbled his earlobe.<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only right that I make good on that promise.\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cBy all means,\u201c she said breathlessly, feeling Jon\u2019s hand skim lightly over the fabric covering her breast. His thumb traced circles around her hard nipple.\u00a0\u201cPlease,\u201c Sansa quietly pleaded. Jon planted kisses from her neck and down the middle of her chest where the robe didn\u2019t cover. When he got to the sliver of skin between her breasts, Sansa felt his hands slowly sliding the robe off her shoulders. His hand covered one breast while he licked, sucked, and nibbled at the other. Sansa\u2019s back arched as she moaned, she could feel herself getting wetter on Jon\u2019s lap.<br></p><p>All of a sudden, Jon\u2019s hands grabbed her ass, he stood up with her, and swiftly laid her on the bed. He laid next to her, propped up on his elbow and, kissed her lips, along her jaw, and down her neck.\u00a0\u201cI need to taste more of you,\u201d he said in a low voice. Sansa entwined her hand into his hair and pulled his lips to hers as she spread her legs open. Jon\u2019s hand traveled down her chest, untied her robe and pushed it open. His hand gently caressed her between her legs, making Sansa moan into his mouth. Jon smiled his small, sexy smile at her and moved down her body. He licked her up with a hunger and desire as Sansa moaned and screamed and called out his name until she came apart.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, Jon,\u201c Sansa panted as he kissed his way up her body.\u00a0\u201cI feel like I can\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201c he smiled.\u00a0\u201cBut I\u2019m sorry to break it to you, you gotta move. We need to go get my keys from Robb\u2019s place before they go off to brunch.\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cMmmmm, but what about you?\u201c Sansa sultrily said as she grazed her hands down his abs and over his sweatpants covered crotch.<br></p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he muttered and closed his eyes. \u201cI need a shower, preferably a cold one. How about we continue this after our first ever date tonight?\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201c Sansa smiled.\u00a0<br></p></p>",

She had a previously planned girls night out with a few of her coworkers that she didn\u2019t want to cancel on. <i>Oh well, at least I made it</i>, she thought as she smoothed out her dress and made her way down the long street.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"672\" data-orig-height=\"595\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/023b9e11febd622633f7cb51a135b945/tumblr_inline_po651nmZij1unegji_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"672\" data-orig-height=\"595\"></figure><p>\u201cSansa! Sansa, you are late! It\u2019s my birthday and you are late,\u201d a drunk Theon shouted when he spotted her coming through the front door. He ran up to her, threw his arm around her shoulders and walked her in, his face close enough to hers where she could smell the alcohol on his breath.\u00a0\u201cWhy are you so late?\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cI told you, birthday boy, I had previous plans with my coworkers and you only just told me last night about your party.\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cWhere are your lady friends? You can make up your lateness to me by bringing your lady friends.\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cThey went home, Theon, I\u2019m sorry.\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cWell let\u2019s get you drunk!\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cSorry, that isn\u2019t happening either, I have my car here so I gotta drive home.\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cWhat? No, no, no. You can stay the night here with me!\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cStop pestering my sister, Greyjoy,\u201c Robb called out and rescued Sansa from Theon\u2019s drunkenness by steering her towards his girlfriend Margaery.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThanks, Robb,\u201d Sansa said gratefully as they walked away and Theon turned his attention to some other girls.</p><p>\u201cNo prob. I\u2019m glad I got to say hi to you before Marg and I take off.\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cAw, you\u2019re leaving me already?\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, we gotta get up early for brunch with my grandma,\u201c Margaery said.\u00a0\u201cSorry, Sans. Arya\u2019s still around here somewhere though. And Jon,\u201c she said with an obvious wink.<br></p><p>\u201cOh God, you\u2019re not still crushing on him are you, Sans?\u201c\u00a0\n\nRobb asked with a raised eyebrow.\n\n<br></p><p>\u201cShhh! I\u2019m not \u2018crushing on him\u2019, Robb,\u201c Sansa said quietly and punched his arm while giving Margaery a warning look. She said goodbye to them and went off to find her little sister Arya.<br></p><p>Sansa always had a bit of a crush on her brother\u2019s best friend. He was always around when they were growing up and Jon was older, independent, sometimes aloof and broody, and completely different than the spoiled rich kids in her class. Instead of fawning over him like her friends did with their consistently changing crushes, Sansa tried to put on an air of sophistication and mystery in hopes it made her seem more mature than the other girls her age. Arya would tell her she was acting like a stuck up snob but Sansa didn\u2019t realize that until she got to college and started to act like herself. Now she was 25. A few boyfriends came and went, some bad, some decent. But she still kept her feelings for Jon. He was now one of her good friends. She had to sit through his relationship with the wild and crazy Ygritte, which lasted about six months. But then, the following New Year\u2019s Eve, the Starks threw a party at their house and they were all pretty drunk. Right as it turned midnight and everybody was cheering or kissing, Jon grabbed Sansa\u2019s face and kissed her. She could taste the alcohol on his lips just as he could probably taste hers and it wasn\u2019t as graceful as a sober kiss could be, but it still made Sansa\u2019s heart flutter. She went to sleep that night hopeful of what may come out of it. But nothing did, it was like Jon had been so drunk that he didn\u2019t even remember kissing her. And Sansa didn\u2019t want to embarrass herself by bringing it up to him when it obviously meant nothing besides a drunk and friendly New Year\u2019s kiss. That was four months ago and Sansa could still feel his full lips on hers.</p><p>Sansa found Arya talking with their friend Brienne and joined in their conversation. Not long after, a happy-drunk Jon came bounding over, stood behind Sansa and wrapped his arm around the front of her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cSansa, you made it!\u201c he exclaimed and kissed the top of her head.<br></p><p>\u201cHi, Jon, you seem very happy,\u201c Sansa said with a laugh, relishing their physical closeness.<br></p><p>\u201cOf course I am! We barbecued some yummy food, I\u2019ve had plenty of my trusty Jameson, all our friends are here, and you\u2019ve now graced us with your loveliness!\u201c<br></p><p>After a while, Arya and Brienne decided to leave. Sansa looked around and realized it was mostly Theon\u2019s old fraternity friends left so she found Jon to tell him she was going to head home too.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I was just gonna order up an Uber home,\u201c Jon said, feeling his pockets to find his phone.\u00a0\u201cShit. I went to Robb\u2019s place before this and we drove together. My house keys are still at his apartment.\u201d He pulled out his phone and called Robb. \u201cHmmm, he\u2019s not answering, they must be asleep.\u201d Jon then looked at her with puppy dog eyes that made her giggle.\u00a0\u201cSansa, can I crash at your place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, you don\u2019t want to stay the night with Theon?\u201c she teased.<br></p><p>\u201cDear God, no! I barely tolerate sober Theon, drunk Theon is the worst.\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cOf course you can stay with me,\u201c Sansa laughed.<br></p><p>\u201cYou sure? I\u2019m not imposing upon you or anything?\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m sure, it\u2019s no problem.\u201c They walked out the front door and into a warm spring rain.\u00a0\u201cWell damn, of course my car is parked far away,\u201c Sansa said, pointing in the direction of where she parked.<br></p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201c Jon took her hand and they ran, laughing up the street. When they finally hopped into her car, their clothes were soaked. As she drove them to her apartment, Jon rested his hand on her thigh and turned his body to face towards her. She glanced over at him and he had a goofy look on his face and his eyes were trying to stay focused on her.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really pretty.\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cRandom, but thanks,\u201c she replied with a little laugh</p><p>\u201cLike more than pretty. You\u2019re fucking gorgeous. Devastatingly beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Jon,\u201d she said shyly, highly aware of his hand running up and down her thigh. Within 15 minutes, she pulled into her parking spot at her apartment complex. \u201cOkay, we\u2019re gonna have to make a break for it through the rain again.\u201d</p><p>\u201c1, 2, 3, go!\u201d Jon exclaimed. They jumped out of the car and Jon once again took her hand as they ran for her door.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I have a pair of Robb\u2019s sweatpants that I stole from him. You can wear that and I\u2019ll put your clothes in the dryer,\u201c Sansa said once they were inside.<br></p><p>\u201cYou stole Robb\u2019s sweatpants? Ooooo, I\u2019m gonna snitch on you!\u201c Jon said, immediately taking of his shirt and revealing his impeccable body.<br></p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t! He thinks he lost them and they\u2019re just so dang comfortable,\u201c she said, pulling them out of her drawer and throwing them to Jon. He went into the master bathroom to change and when he came back out, she took his clothes and popped them in the dryer. She took her turn in the bathroom to change into her pajamas and wash her face. When she came back into the bedroom, Jon was sitting on her bed and scrolling through his phone. <i>Oh God, where should I suggest he sleep? Is it too obvious if I tell him he can share my bed?</i> she thought to herself. He looked up at her as she strode into the room.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"672\" data-orig-height=\"479\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e79d34a9422f83dda6bbd379ec9f06d9/tumblr_inline_po64201nYh1unegji_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"672\" data-orig-height=\"479\"></figure><p>\u201cSansa, you\u2019re just the best. Come sit with me,\u201c his speech was still slightly slurred as he grabbed her hand and pulled her onto the bed next to him.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the best too, drunky.\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cWhy are you so sexy?\u201c Jon asked, pushing a few strands of her hair behind her ear.<br></p><p>\u201cJon, I\u2019m in pajamas and there\u2019s nothing on my face, there\u2019s nothing sexy happening right now,\u201c she laughed.<br></p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re always sexy, no matter what you\u2019re wearing. You\u2019re perfect, it\u2019s just a fact.\u201c<br></p><p><i>Is this just the alcohol talking?</i> Sansa thought to herself.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201c Jon said, picking up his phone and scrolling through a Spotify playlist with the simple title of\u00a0\u201cS\u201d. Once he selected a song, the opening tunes of\u00a0\u201cI Want Some More\u201d by Dan Auerbach began to play. Jon suddenly got up and stood in front of Sansa.\u00a0\u201cThis song is about you, Sans. This is what you do to me.\u201d He began to roll his pelvis to the music towards her. Sansa\u2019s mouth dropped.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the name of Magic Mike is happening right now? Where am I? Who are you? You\u2019re not Jon Snow,\u201c she laughed while appreciating his shirtless body dancing sexually towards her.<br></p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, fine, I\u2019m not a dancer,\u201c he said, giving up and sitting back down next to her.<br></p><p>\u201cI mean\u2026you weren\u2019t terrible. But what\u2019s happening right now? Why are you saying this song is about me?\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cBecause your sweet lips are really like nothing I\u2019ve ever tasted before and I want more of it,\u201c Jon said, his already alcohol-flushed face turning more red.<br></p><p>\u201cYou remember that kiss?\u201c Sansa asked, surprised.<br></p><p>\u201cOf course I do, it was only the best moment ever!\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cSo then why didn\u2019t you say anything about it after that night? I thought you were so drunk that you didn\u2019t remember you did that.\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a coward. I had to get that drunk just to get the balls to do it that night.\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cAnd now you want more? Is this just the alcohol talking? You wanna hook up whenever you\u2019re drunk?\u201d Sansa asked, trying not to feel slightly hurt by the notion.</p><p>\u201cNo. Not just when I\u2019m drunk. All the time, Sans.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve never said anything.\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cLike I said, I\u2019m a coward. The alcohol makes me brave enough to do something about it. But when I\u2019m sober, I\u2019m too shy to talk to you about it or ask you out. You\u2019re perfect, Sansa. Just like the song says, everything you\u2019ve got is just what I always wanted. Right down to a T, nothing about you that don\u2019t please me.\u201d He sang the lines with the song as he took her hands in his, making Sansa giggle.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you felt like that?\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cSince we were kids,\u201c Jon answered sheepishly.<br></p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cYes way. So, tell me, am I just making a fool out of myself here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean you did try to Magic Mike me and I won\u2019t ever let you live that down. But I\u2019ve actually had feelings for you since we were kids too.\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cBut you seemed like you didn\u2019t want anything to do with me until we actually became friends when you got older.\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, that was my attempt to act cool and mature. It really did come off as bitchiness, didn\u2019t it?\u201c Sansa laughed.<br></p><p>\u201cIt was\u2026an endearing bitchiness,\u201d Jon joked.\u00a0\u201cSo\u2026do you still feel the same way about me?\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cIt never went away,\u201c she said slowly.\u00a0\u201cUgh, this isn\u2019t fair that I\u2019m talking about this sober while you get to be drunk!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSo let me get this straight\u2026I like you\u2026you like me\u2026I think we should do something about that.\u201c Jon\u2019s eyes were on her lips and his hand went up and entwined in her hair.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve waited so long to make you feel good.\u201d Her body slightly quivered in anticipation. This was what Sansa wanted, for all of her feelings to be out in the open, to know that Jon felt the same way, to taste his lips on hers again. <i>No, not like this,</i> Sansa suddenly thought.<br></p><p>\u201cWait,\u201c she whispered. His lips were so close to hers and she wanted them so bad. She leaned her forehead against his and closed her eyes.\u00a0\u201cI want this. More than anything. But I need to know you feel the same way when you\u2019re not drunk. It\u2019s just that you seem more drunk tonight than you were on New Year\u2019s Eve, and you couldn\u2019t even acknowledge the kiss afterwards. What if you don\u2019t even remember all of this tomorrow? You danced for me, that\u2019s how drunk you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can promise you I\u2019ll feel the exact same way when I\u2019m sober and I\u2019ll wish I could forget my dancing act,\u201c Jon laughed.\u00a0\u201cBut I get it, Sans,\u201d he said and placed a light kiss on the tip of her nose.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll prove it to you tomorrow and I\u2019m gonna make sure you feel good.\u201d Sansa smiled and bit her lip.\u00a0\u201cGod, you don\u2019t even know what you do to me!\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go to sleep, Magic Mike,\u201c Sansa teased as she laid back on her bed and pulled him down with her.<br></p><p>\u201cPlease, please don\u2019t tell anyone about that!\u201c Jon laughed as they got under the covers.</p><p>\u201cFine. But expect me to make fun of you for it in private.\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201c\u00a0</p><p>Sansa faced away from him but nestled her back against his chest while he draped his arm over her and pulled her closer.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve wanted exactly this for so long,\u201d Jon said sleepily. Sansa drifted off to sleep with a smile on her face.</p><p>The next morning, she woke up and realized they had stayed in the same position throughout the night. She smiled to herself as she heard his soft snores behind her. But that smile soon turned to nerves. <i>What if he\u2019s just a horny drunk?</i> she thought. She carefully slid out of bed so she wouldn\u2019t wake him up and took a shower. When she was done, she threw on her little robe and quietly opened the bathroom door to the bedroom. She found Jon awake, sitting up in her bed and rubbing his eyes.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"672\" data-orig-height=\"611\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0bb84f3b8cba5c4d6bb6eacfdb0528d9/tumblr_inline_po63fltiZx1unegji_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"672\" data-orig-height=\"611\"></figure><p>\u201cHow\u2019re you feeling, big guy?\u201c Sansa teased as she bushed out her hair.</p><p>\u201cNot too bad, surprisingly. Just in desperate need of mouthwash.\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cMedicine cabinet,\u201c Sansa said with a smile.<br></p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201c Jon said and went to the bathroom. When he was done, he stood in the doorway and leaned against it.\u00a0\u201cSo. I danced for you.\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cThat is a fact, yes,\u201d Sansa laughed. <i>Okay, he remembers things. But does he really feel the way he said he does? Moment of truth,\u00a0</i>Sansa thought nervously.<br></p><p>\u201cSans, I meant every word I said last night,\u201d he said, his voice shy as he looked at her.\u00a0\u201cYou really are perfect and you really are everything I\u2019ve ever wanted. For me, that song really was about you. I wish I wasn\u2019t so embarrassing about it, but it is what it is,\u201c he said with a nervous laugh.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sure I wasn\u2019t all that eloquent last night. But not only are you sexy and devastatingly beautiful, you\u2019re the sweetest person I know, you just want to take care of people and make sure they\u2019re happy, you\u2019re smart and creative, you know how to take care of yourself and you\u2019re great at your job. You\u2019re you and it\u2019s perfect.\u201c</p><p>\u201cJon -\u201c Sansa was nearly speechless.<br></p><p>\u201cOkay, this is going to be embarrassing for me,\u201c he said and crossed the room to grab his phone. He once again opened Spotify and pulled up the same\u00a0\u201cS\u201c playlist.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve had this for a long time now.

She gave a quick scroll through the playlist, spotting songs she knew and some she didn\u2019t.\u00a0There was \u201cI Found You\u201c and \u201cBe Mine\u201c by Alabama Shakes.\n\nA few Black Keys songs like \u201cEverlasting Light\u201c, \u201cThe Only One\u201c, \u201cGirl Is On My Mind\u201c, and \u201cYour Touch\u201d. Another song by Dan Auerbach called\u00a0\u201cNever In My Wildest Dreams.\u201c\u00a0\u00a0The list went on and on but as soon as she spotted \u201cI Want Some More\u201d, she clicked play and put the phone down. She looked over at Jon with a sly smile and bit her lip.\u00a0 She came to him, leaned down and pressed her lips to his. The kiss was full and passionate and she could hear a small, relieved sigh escape Jon\u2019s mouth.<br></p><p>\u201cSo, you want some more of this?\u201c Sansa teased after she pulled away.<br></p><p>\u201cI want more of everything with you,\u201c he whispered, his hands grazing the sides of her body until they came to a rest on her hips.\u00a0\u201cCan I take you out to dinner tonight?\u201c<br></p><p>Sansa smiled and nodded. She then started swaying her hips to the music.\u00a0\u201cSince you gave me a little taste of your moves last night, maybe it\u2019s only fair that I give you a taste of my own.\u201d She peeled Jon\u2019s hands off her hips and turned around, still swaying her body to the music. She slowly lowered until she was very lightly grinding her ass on Jon\u2019s lap.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Jon\u2019s voice was filled with awe and need. Sansa turned around again, put a knee on either side of him on the bed and straddled his lap. His hands grabbed at her hips and pulled her closer. He looked up into her face and she bit her lip again. Jon let out a sexy groan and covered her lips with his. As he pulled away from the kiss, he lightly bit her lower lip and pulled at it.\u00a0\u201cI believe last night I told you I\u2019m going to make you feel good today.\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cYes, you definitely did say that,\u201c Sansa whispered into his ear as she licked and nibbled his earlobe.<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only right that I make good on that promise.\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cBy all means,\u201c she said breathlessly, feeling Jon\u2019s hand skim lightly over the fabric covering her breast. His thumb traced circles around her hard nipple.\u00a0\u201cPlease,\u201c Sansa quietly pleaded. Jon planted kisses from her neck and down the middle of her chest where the robe didn\u2019t cover. When he got to the sliver of skin between her breasts, Sansa felt his hands slowly sliding the robe off her shoulders. His hand covered one breast while he licked, sucked, and nibbled at the other. Sansa\u2019s back arched as she moaned, she could feel herself getting wetter on Jon\u2019s lap.<br></p><p>All of a sudden, Jon\u2019s hands grabbed her ass, he stood up with her, and swiftly laid her on the bed. He laid next to her, propped up on his elbow and, kissed her lips, along her jaw, and down her neck.\u00a0\u201cI need to taste more of you,\u201d he said in a low voice. Sansa entwined her hand into his hair and pulled his lips to hers as she spread her legs open. Jon\u2019s hand traveled down her chest, untied her robe and pushed it open. His hand gently caressed her between her legs, making Sansa moan into his mouth. Jon smiled his small, sexy smile at her and moved down her body. He licked her up with a hunger and desire as Sansa moaned and screamed and called out his name until she came apart.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, Jon,\u201c Sansa panted as he kissed his way up her body.\u00a0\u201cI feel like I can\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201c he smiled.\u00a0\u201cBut I\u2019m sorry to break it to you, you gotta move.

She had a previously planned girls night out with a few of her coworkers that she didn&rsquo;t want to cancel on. <i>Oh well, at least I made it</i>, she thought as she smoothed out her dress and made her way down the long street.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/023b9e11febd622633f7cb51a135b945/tumblr_inline_po651nmZij1unegji_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>&ldquo;Sansa! Sansa, you are late! It&rsquo;s my birthday and you are late,&rdquo; a drunk Theon shouted when he spotted her coming through the front door. He ran up to her, threw his arm around her shoulders and walked her in, his face close enough to hers where she could smell the alcohol on his breath.&nbsp;&ldquo;Why are you so late?&ldquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I told you, birthday boy, I had previous plans with my coworkers and you only just told me last night about your party.&ldquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Where are your lady friends? You can make up your lateness to me by bringing your lady friends.&ldquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;They went home, Theon, I&rsquo;m sorry.&ldquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well let&rsquo;s get you drunk!&ldquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, that isn&rsquo;t happening either, I have my car here so I gotta drive home.&ldquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What? No, no, no. You can stay the night here with me!&ldquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Stop pestering my sister, Greyjoy,&ldquo; Robb called out and rescued Sansa from Theon&rsquo;s drunkenness by steering her towards his girlfriend Margaery.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, Robb,&rdquo; Sansa said gratefully as they walked away and Theon turned his attention to some other girls.</p><p>&ldquo;No prob. I&rsquo;m glad I got to say hi to you before Marg and I take off.&ldquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Aw, you&rsquo;re leaving me already?&ldquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, we gotta get up early for brunch with my grandma,&ldquo; Margaery said.&nbsp;&ldquo;Sorry, Sans. Arya&rsquo;s still around here somewhere though. And Jon,&ldquo; she said with an obvious wink.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh God, you&rsquo;re not still crushing on him are you, Sans?&ldquo;&nbsp;\n\nRobb asked with a raised eyebrow.\n\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Shhh! I&rsquo;m not &lsquo;crushing on him&rsquo;, Robb,&ldquo; Sansa said quietly and punched his arm while giving Margaery a warning look. She said goodbye to them and went off to find her little sister Arya.<br /></p><p>Sansa always had a bit of a crush on her brother&rsquo;s best friend. He was always around when they were growing up and Jon was older, independent, sometimes aloof and broody, and completely different than the spoiled rich kids in her class. Instead of fawning over him like her friends did with their consistently changing crushes, Sansa tried to put on an air of sophistication and mystery in hopes it made her seem more mature than the other girls her age. Arya would tell her she was acting like a stuck up snob but Sansa didn&rsquo;t realize that until she got to college and started to act like herself. Now she was 25. A few boyfriends came and went, some bad, some decent. But she still kept her feelings for Jon. He was now one of her good friends. She had to sit through his relationship with the wild and crazy Ygritte, which lasted about six months. But then, the following New Year&rsquo;s Eve, the Starks threw a party at their house and they were all pretty drunk. Right as it turned midnight and everybody was cheering or kissing, Jon grabbed Sansa&rsquo;s face and kissed her. She could taste the alcohol on his lips just as he could probably taste hers and it wasn&rsquo;t as graceful as a sober kiss could be, but it still made Sansa&rsquo;s heart flutter. She went to sleep that night hopeful of what may come out of it. But nothing did, it was like Jon had been so drunk that he didn&rsquo;t even remember kissing her. And Sansa didn&rsquo;t want to embarrass herself by bringing it up to him when it obviously meant nothing besides a drunk and friendly New Year&rsquo;s kiss. That was four months ago and Sansa could still feel his full lips on hers.</p><p>Sansa found Arya talking with their friend Brienne and joined in their conversation. Not long after, a happy-drunk Jon came bounding over, stood behind Sansa and wrapped his arm around the front of her shoulders.</p><p>&ldquo;Sansa, you made it!&ldquo; he exclaimed and kissed the top of her head.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hi, Jon, you seem very happy,&ldquo; Sansa said with a laugh, relishing their physical closeness.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Of course I am! We barbecued some yummy food, I&rsquo;ve had plenty of my trusty Jameson, all our friends are here, and you&rsquo;ve now graced us with your loveliness!&ldquo;<br /></p><p>After a while, Arya and Brienne decided to leave. Sansa looked around and realized it was mostly Theon&rsquo;s old fraternity friends left so she found Jon to tell him she was going to head home too.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I was just gonna order up an Uber home,&ldquo; Jon said, feeling his pockets to find his phone.&nbsp;&ldquo;Shit. I went to Robb&rsquo;s place before this and we drove together. My house keys are still at his apartment.&rdquo; He pulled out his phone and called Robb. &ldquo;Hmmm, he&rsquo;s not answering, they must be asleep.&rdquo; Jon then looked at her with puppy dog eyes that made her giggle.&nbsp;&ldquo;Sansa, can I crash at your place?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What, you don&rsquo;t want to stay the night with Theon?&ldquo; she teased.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Dear God, no! I barely tolerate sober Theon, drunk Theon is the worst.&ldquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Of course you can stay with me,&ldquo; Sansa laughed.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You sure? I&rsquo;m not imposing upon you or anything?&ldquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m sure, it&rsquo;s no problem.&ldquo; They walked out the front door and into a warm spring rain.&nbsp;&ldquo;Well damn, of course my car is parked far away,&ldquo; Sansa said, pointing in the direction of where she parked.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go!&ldquo; Jon took her hand and they ran, laughing up the street. When they finally hopped into her car, their clothes were soaked. As she drove them to her apartment, Jon rested his hand on her thigh and turned his body to face towards her. She glanced over at him and he had a goofy look on his face and his eyes were trying to stay focused on her.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re really pretty.&ldquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Random, but thanks,&ldquo; she replied with a little laugh</p><p>&ldquo;Like more than pretty. You&rsquo;re fucking gorgeous. Devastatingly beautiful.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Jon,&rdquo; she said shyly, highly aware of his hand running up and down her thigh. Within 15 minutes, she pulled into her parking spot at her apartment complex. &ldquo;Okay, we&rsquo;re gonna have to make a break for it through the rain again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;1, 2, 3, go!&rdquo; Jon exclaimed. They jumped out of the car and Jon once again took her hand as they ran for her door.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, I have a pair of Robb&rsquo;s sweatpants that I stole from him. You can wear that and I&rsquo;ll put your clothes in the dryer,&ldquo; Sansa said once they were inside.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You stole Robb&rsquo;s sweatpants? Ooooo, I&rsquo;m gonna snitch on you!&ldquo; Jon said, immediately taking of his shirt and revealing his impeccable body.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t! He thinks he lost them and they&rsquo;re just so dang comfortable,&ldquo; she said, pulling them out of her drawer and throwing them to Jon. He went into the master bathroom to change and when he came back out, she took his clothes and popped them in the dryer. She took her turn in the bathroom to change into her pajamas and wash her face. When she came back into the bedroom, Jon was sitting on her bed and scrolling through his phone. <i>Oh God, where should I suggest he sleep? Is it too obvious if I tell him he can share my bed?</i> she thought to herself. He looked up at her as she strode into the room.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e79d34a9422f83dda6bbd379ec9f06d9/tumblr_inline_po64201nYh1unegji_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>&ldquo;Sansa, you&rsquo;re just the best. Come sit with me,&ldquo; his speech was still slightly slurred as he grabbed her hand and pulled her onto the bed next to him.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the best too, drunky.&ldquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Why are you so sexy?&ldquo; Jon asked, pushing a few strands of her hair behind her ear.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Jon, I&rsquo;m in pajamas and there&rsquo;s nothing on my face, there&rsquo;s nothing sexy happening right now,&ldquo; she laughed.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re always sexy, no matter what you&rsquo;re wearing. You&rsquo;re perfect, it&rsquo;s just a fact.&ldquo;<br /></p><p><i>Is this just the alcohol talking?</i> Sansa thought to herself.</p><p>&ldquo;Hold on,&ldquo; Jon said, picking up his phone and scrolling through a Spotify playlist with the simple title of&nbsp;&ldquo;S&rdquo;. Once he selected a song, the opening tunes of&nbsp;&ldquo;I Want Some More&rdquo; by Dan Auerbach began to play. Jon suddenly got up and stood in front of Sansa.&nbsp;&ldquo;This song is about you, Sans. This is what you do to me.&rdquo; He began to roll his pelvis to the music towards her. Sansa&rsquo;s mouth dropped.</p><p>&ldquo;What in the name of Magic Mike is happening right now? Where am I? Who are you? You&rsquo;re not Jon Snow,&ldquo; she laughed while appreciating his shirtless body dancing sexually towards her.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Okay, okay, fine, I&rsquo;m not a dancer,&ldquo; he said, giving up and sitting back down next to her.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I mean&hellip;you weren&rsquo;t terrible. But what&rsquo;s happening right now? Why are you saying this song is about me?&ldquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Because your sweet lips are really like nothing I&rsquo;ve ever tasted before and I want more of it,&ldquo; Jon said, his already alcohol-flushed face turning more red.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You remember that kiss?&ldquo; Sansa asked, surprised.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Of course I do, it was only the best moment ever!&ldquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;So then why didn&rsquo;t you say anything about it after that night? I thought you were so drunk that you didn&rsquo;t remember you did that.&ldquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a coward. I had to get that drunk just to get the balls to do it that night.&ldquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;And now you want more? Is this just the alcohol talking? You wanna hook up whenever you&rsquo;re drunk?&rdquo; Sansa asked, trying not to feel slightly hurt by the notion.</p><p>&ldquo;No. Not just when I&rsquo;m drunk. All the time, Sans.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve never said anything.&ldquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Like I said, I&rsquo;m a coward. The alcohol makes me brave enough to do something about it. But when I&rsquo;m sober, I&rsquo;m too shy to talk to you about it or ask you out. You&rsquo;re perfect, Sansa. Just like the song says, everything you&rsquo;ve got is just what I always wanted. Right down to a T, nothing about you that don&rsquo;t please me.&rdquo; He sang the lines with the song as he took her hands in his, making Sansa giggle.</p><p>&ldquo;How long have you felt like that?&ldquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Since we were kids,&ldquo; Jon answered sheepishly.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No way.&ldquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes way. So, tell me, am I just making a fool out of myself here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. I mean you did try to Magic Mike me and I won&rsquo;t ever let you live that down. But I&rsquo;ve actually had feelings for you since we were kids too.&ldquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lying.&ldquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Absolutely not.&ldquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;But you seemed like you didn&rsquo;t want anything to do with me until we actually became friends when you got older.&ldquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, that was my attempt to act cool and mature. It really did come off as bitchiness, didn&rsquo;t it?&ldquo; Sansa laughed.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It was&hellip;an endearing bitchiness,&rdquo; Jon joked.&nbsp;&ldquo;So&hellip;do you still feel the same way about me?&ldquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It never went away,&ldquo; she said slowly.&nbsp;&ldquo;Ugh, this isn&rsquo;t fair that I&rsquo;m talking about this sober while you get to be drunk!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;So let me get this straight&hellip;I like you&hellip;you like me&hellip;I think we should do something about that.&ldquo; Jon&rsquo;s eyes were on her lips and his hand went up and entwined in her hair.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve waited so long to make you feel good.&rdquo; Her body slightly quivered in anticipation. This was what Sansa wanted, for all of her feelings to be out in the open, to know that Jon felt the same way, to taste his lips on hers again. <i>No, not like this,</i> Sansa suddenly thought.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Wait,&ldquo; she whispered. His lips were so close to hers and she wanted them so bad. She leaned her forehead against his and closed her eyes.&nbsp;&ldquo;I want this. More than anything. But I need to know you feel the same way when you&rsquo;re not drunk. It&rsquo;s just that you seem more drunk tonight than you were on New Year&rsquo;s Eve, and you couldn&rsquo;t even acknowledge the kiss afterwards. What if you don&rsquo;t even remember all of this tomorrow? You danced for me, that&rsquo;s how drunk you are.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can promise you I&rsquo;ll feel the exact same way when I&rsquo;m sober and I&rsquo;ll wish I could forget my dancing act,&ldquo; Jon laughed.&nbsp;&ldquo;But I get it, Sans,&rdquo; he said and placed a light kiss on the tip of her nose.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll prove it to you tomorrow and I&rsquo;m gonna make sure you feel good.&rdquo; Sansa smiled and bit her lip.&nbsp;&ldquo;God, you don&rsquo;t even know what you do to me!&ldquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to sleep, Magic Mike,&ldquo; Sansa teased as she laid back on her bed and pulled him down with her.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Please, please don&rsquo;t tell anyone about that!&ldquo; Jon laughed as they got under the covers.</p><p>&ldquo;Fine. But expect me to make fun of you for it in private.&ldquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Deal.&ldquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Sansa faced away from him but nestled her back against his chest while he draped his arm over her and pulled her closer.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted exactly this for so long,&rdquo; Jon said sleepily. Sansa drifted off to sleep with a smile on her face.</p><p>The next morning, she woke up and realized they had stayed in the same position throughout the night. She smiled to herself as she heard his soft snores behind her. But that smile soon turned to nerves. <i>What if he&rsquo;s just a horny drunk?</i> she thought. She carefully slid out of bed so she wouldn&rsquo;t wake him up and took a shower. When she was done, she threw on her little robe and quietly opened the bathroom door to the bedroom. She found Jon awake, sitting up in her bed and rubbing his eyes.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0bb84f3b8cba5c4d6bb6eacfdb0528d9/tumblr_inline_po63fltiZx1unegji_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;re you feeling, big guy?&ldquo; Sansa teased as she bushed out her hair.</p><p>&ldquo;Not too bad, surprisingly. Just in desperate need of mouthwash.&ldquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Medicine cabinet,&ldquo; Sansa said with a smile.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Thank God,&ldquo; Jon said and went to the bathroom. When he was done, he stood in the doorway and leaned against it.&nbsp;&ldquo;So. I danced for you.&ldquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;That is a fact, yes,&rdquo; Sansa laughed. <i>Okay, he remembers things. But does he really feel the way he said he does? Moment of truth,&nbsp;</i>Sansa thought nervously.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Sans, I meant every word I said last night,&rdquo; he said, his voice shy as he looked at her.&nbsp;&ldquo;You really are perfect and you really are everything I&rsquo;ve ever wanted. For me, that song really was about you. I wish I wasn&rsquo;t so embarrassing about it, but it is what it is,&ldquo; he said with a nervous laugh.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I wasn&rsquo;t all that eloquent last night. But not only are you sexy and devastatingly beautiful, you&rsquo;re the sweetest person I know, you just want to take care of people and make sure they&rsquo;re happy, you&rsquo;re smart and creative, you know how to take care of yourself and you&rsquo;re great at your job. You&rsquo;re you and it&rsquo;s perfect.&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jon -&ldquo; Sansa was nearly speechless.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Okay, this is going to be embarrassing for me,&ldquo; he said and crossed the room to grab his phone. He once again opened Spotify and pulled up the same&nbsp;&ldquo;S&ldquo; playlist.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had this for a long time now. Constantly adding songs I hear that make me think of you.&ldquo; He handed the phone to her as she leaned against her dresser.</p><p>&ldquo;S is for Sansa?&ldquo; she asked, looking over at him as he watched her nervously and sat on the edge of the bed. She gave a quick scroll through the playlist, spotting songs she knew and some she didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;There was &ldquo;I Found You&ldquo; and &ldquo;Be Mine&ldquo; by Alabama Shakes.\n\nA few Black Keys songs like &ldquo;Everlasting Light&ldquo;, &ldquo;The Only One&ldquo;, &ldquo;Girl Is On My Mind&ldquo;, and &ldquo;Your Touch&rdquo;. Another song by Dan Auerbach called&nbsp;&ldquo;Never In My Wildest Dreams.&ldquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;The list went on and on but as soon as she spotted &ldquo;I Want Some More&rdquo;, she clicked play and put the phone down. She looked over at Jon with a sly smile and bit her lip.&nbsp; She came to him, leaned down and pressed her lips to his. The kiss was full and passionate and she could hear a small, relieved sigh escape Jon&rsquo;s mouth.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;So, you want some more of this?&ldquo; Sansa teased after she pulled away.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I want more of everything with you,&ldquo; he whispered, his hands grazing the sides of her body until they came to a rest on her hips.&nbsp;&ldquo;Can I take you out to dinner tonight?&ldquo;<br /></p><p>Sansa smiled and nodded. She then started swaying her hips to the music.&nbsp;&ldquo;Since you gave me a little taste of your moves last night, maybe it&rsquo;s only fair that I give you a taste of my own.&rdquo; She peeled Jon&rsquo;s hands off her hips and turned around, still swaying her body to the music. She slowly lowered until she was very lightly grinding her ass on Jon&rsquo;s lap.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck.&rdquo; Jon&rsquo;s voice was filled with awe and need.

His thumb traced circles around her hard nipple.&nbsp;&ldquo;Please,&ldquo; Sansa quietly pleaded. Jon planted kisses from her neck and down the middle of her chest where the robe didn&rsquo;t cover. When he got to the sliver of skin between her breasts, Sansa felt his hands slowly sliding the robe off her shoulders. His hand covered one breast while he licked, sucked, and nibbled at the other.

        "answer": "<p>Well, Anon I haven\u2019t actually read the books, but from my assessment, Ygritte was quite better than Drogo. Since I haven\u2019t read the books, let me assess this from the show\u2019s perspective. In the show, Drogo is much worse. I mean he raped his wife time and time again, and even though he grew to love her, Dany was nothing more than his wife, his means of siring children. Ygritte on the other hand, even though wasn\u2019t as dominating and violent as Drogo, but she, in a way, pressurized Jon to accept her, or to sleep with her. Jon was a captive during his time with the Wildlings and had he not slept with Ygritte, they would\u2019ve branded him a traitor and killed him off then and there. I mean the whole point of being a Freefolk, was to renounce all NW vows, to which celibacy was one of them. However, I believe that Ygritte grew to love him so much, that she was willing to abandon/betray the Freefolk for him. The scene which shows that was when they asked Jon to kill an old farmer, Jon refuses and Ygritte jumps in to defend him from the other Wildlings, to which Jon pushes her to the ground, preventing her from betraying her people. Regardless of her constantly reminding Jon not to betray her, and in extension, the Wildlings (or that he will face consequences), she truly did love him, with all her heart. I have heard that in the book, Jon being the reserved person that he is, would at times feel uncomfortable towards her insistence to be intimate with him. Ygritte does have a strong personality, and sometimes he would feel overwhelmed, or rather, forced in a sense. If I\u2019m not mistaken, I think there\u2019s a scene in the books where he makes Ghost sleep between them. I mean, from what the show portrayed, Ygritte can come out quite strong on Jon, but that is nothing compared to the relationship between Drogo and Dany. So to answer your question, I believe Drogo is way worse than Ygritte.</p>",

Since I haven\u2019t read the books, let me assess this from the show\u2019s perspective. In the show, Drogo is much worse. I mean he raped his wife time and time again, and even though he grew to love her, Dany was nothing more than his wife, his means of siring children. Ygritte on the other hand, even though wasn\u2019t as dominating and violent as Drogo, but she, in a way, pressurized Jon to accept her, or to sleep with her. Jon was a captive during his time with the Wildlings and had he not slept with Ygritte, they would\u2019ve branded him a traitor and killed him off then and there. I mean the whole point of being a Freefolk, was to renounce all NW vows, to which celibacy was one of them. However, I believe that Ygritte grew to love him so much, that she was willing to abandon/betray the Freefolk for him. The scene which shows that was when they asked Jon to kill an old farmer, Jon refuses and Ygritte jumps in to defend him from the other Wildlings, to which Jon pushes her to the ground, preventing her from betraying her people. Regardless of her constantly reminding Jon not to betray her, and in extension, the Wildlings (or that he will face consequences), she truly did love him, with all her heart.
