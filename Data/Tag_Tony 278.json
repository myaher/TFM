Hope you\u2019ll enjoy this.</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re starring.\u201d</p><p>Peter signed, closed his locker and walked towards his next class. Ned immediately caught up with him.</p><p>\u201cI was not starring. I was just\u2026 thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah? About what? Mr Starker\u2019s dick?\u201d</p><p>Peter didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m not judging or anything. He is hot, I guess. You know, if you\u2019re into that but \u2013\u201c</p><p>Peter wasn\u2019t listening. Partly because they already had this conversation. Multiple times. And frankly, it\u2019s not his fault Ned couldn\u2019t wrap his mind around the fact that Peter had a crush on a teacher. But also because Mr Stark has just walked into the classroom and Peter was immediately distracted by his\u2026 everything.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna die.\u201d He said miserably under his breath. Ned chuckled.</p><p>The bell rang and Ned took his place in front of Peter. Mr Stark faced the class.</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, Mr Parker, I want you to stay after class. I have a question concerning your constant lack of attention in, as it turns out, exclusively only my classes.\u201d</p><p>Mr Stark looked somewhat annoyed and it bothered Peter much more than his classmates snickering at him.</p><p>The rest of the class went as usual. Mr Stark was explaining things and Peter was doing his best to ignore him. Normally Mr Stark wasn\u2019t bothered by it much. He knew Peter could handle the programme on his own. He would occasionally ask him something when nobody else could answer or to just see if he could catch him off guard. Peter was always perfect though. He would come out of his thoughts after the third or fourth time Mr Stark would call him and give the right answer after one look at the board. But today Stark&rsquo;s patience seemed to has run out.</p><p>\u201cPeter Parker! If you insist on being elsewhere during my lessons you might as well not show up at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr Stark.\u201d</p><p>The bell rang again. Ned looked at him sympathetically before leaving. Peter was so not looking forward to a conversation he was about to have with the teacher. Finally, after everybody left, Peter was standing in front of the teacher\u2019s desk.</p><p>\u201cOk, Peter, I\u2019m gonna get straight to the point. I was talking to Banner about you. He was bragging to me about some formula you created. To which I said that it wasn\u2019t surprising at all and you could do even more if you weren\u2019t daydreaming during lessons. And then suddenly I discovered that the only lessons you are not paying attention to are mine. So tell me, Peter, what makes me so special? And there better be a damn good reason because I\u2019m leaning towards getting offended and trust me you don\u2019t want to get on my bad side.\u201d</p><p>Peter was starting to panic. He couldn\u2019t just tell things how they were. He couldn\u2019t say that he was impossibly infatuated with the man. That whenever he paid close attention to his voice, to his movements, to him in general he got lost. All he could think about is kissing him and feeling his hands touching his body. He could just imagine Mr Stark\u2019s strong hands lifting him on to the desk. Peter would wrap his legs around him and then tilt his head back. He hoped Mr Stark would leave bite marks on his neck\u2026</p><p>\u201cEarth to Peter. I want an explanation. And I\u2019m warning you, Parker, I\u2019m not a patient man.\u201d</p><p>Peter almost moaned at that. He decided he didn\u2019t care anymore. This had to stop one way or the other. He leaned on the desk and planted a brief kiss on Mr Stark\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t handle NOT ignoring you. Every time I do I\u2019m losing my freaking mind. I thought it would be alright since I\u2019m pretty good with physics anyway but I guess it\u2019s not,\u201d he felt tears in the corners of his eyes and blinked them away. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll transfer from your class. I\u2019m sorry I fell for you.\u201d</p><p>He practically ran out of the class.</p><p>Tony touched his lips and smiled.</p><p>\u201cInteresting.\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>Tony knew someone just came up to his desk. He also had a pretty good idea of who that someone might be so he decided to ignore it. He could almost physically feel Peter\u2019s nervousness. After a couple of minutes, he finally took pity on the kid.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Peter? I haven\u2019t got all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I just\u2026 I need you to sign this. Please.\u201d</p><p>Tony looked at the boy. Peter shifted uncomfortably and handed him the form. Tony looked through it briefly. As he suspected it was a transfer file. He crushed the paper and with one precise throw sent it in the bin.</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>Peter looked at him dumbfounded.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were supposed to be smart. Figure it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou can go now.\u201d</p><p>Tony got back to his work. After a while, he heard Peter walking away.</p><p>-</p><p>After a month Peter came to a decision that Mr Stark wanted payback. He was asking him something every couple of minutes, making sure Peter paid attention. Sometimes he just asked him to repeat what he has just said, other times it was some kind of a trick question \u2013 those tend to be hard. He made a habit of asking him to stay after class to see if he was taking notes. In other words, he made sure he had Peter\u2019s full attention during class. And Peter was going crazy. Tony would ask him to solve something at the board and then stand behind him talking right into his ear. He took every opportunity he had to touch him. He could place a hand on his shoulder or on his back while leaning over his desk to see what he was doing, he even ruffled his hair a couple of times. Nobody seemed to make much of it. Ned thought he was just finally tired of the way Peter acted so he took matters into his own hands. But Peter was sure there was something else going on. He couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Tony Stark.</p><p>-</p><p>Peter was standing near his locker bracing himself for his next class \u2013 physics. Mr Stark was standing across the hallway. Peter could only see his back but he knew the man was in a good mood. Which probably meant more suffering for Peter.</p><p>He didn\u2019t realise he was starring until Mr Stark looked at him with a slightly raised eyebrow. Peter blushed and turned away. He took a deep breath and closed the locker. Mr Stark was standing right behind him.</p><p>\u201cHate to tell you this, Parker, but they still haven\u2019t invented laser eyes so you can stop trying to burn a hole in me with your beautiful eyes.\u201d</p><p>Peter blushed and thought he should really stop blushing at everything Mr Stark says to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not\u2026 I wasn't\u2026 I just\u2026 What are you trying to do?\u201d</p><p>Mr Stark smiled like he won something and for the first time ever Peter was scared of him. He had a suspicion Mr Stark was counting his question as defeat.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean. What do you want from me? Are you bored or something? I\u2019m not your toy.\u201d</p><p>Tony leaned in and breathed out a small little word right into Peter\u2019s ear.</p><p>\u201cYet.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes flew wide open. Tony took a step back.</p><p>\u201cYou have a decathlon practice after school tomorrow. Come to see me after you\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>He waited for Peter to nod and went away. The rest of the day was a blur to Peter.</p><p>-</p><p>Peter didn\u2019t know how long he has stood there in front of Mr Stark\u2019s class before finally opening the door. The man was going through some papers and didn\u2019t even look up.</p><p>\u201cLock the door.\u201d</p><p>Peter froze.</p><p>\u201cW-why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m not gonna lose my job because of you.\u201d</p><p>Peter hesitated but after a moment he did what he was told. He looked at the man who put away the papers and beckoned him to come closer. Peter stopped in front of him not knowing what he was supposed to do. No matter how hard he tried he couldn\u2019t figure Mr Stark out.</p><p>\u201cDo you know why you are here?\u201d</p><p>Tony put his hands on Peter\u2019s thighs and guided him to sit on his lap. Peter exhaled sharply instinctively putting his hands on the man\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t\u2026 why would you?..\u201d</p><p>\u201cParker, you need to start paying attention. Consider this for a second: do you think I would let just <i>anyone</i> slack off all of my classes? You\u2019re smart and beautiful and innocent and I\u2019m not going to pass on the opportunity to completely ruin you. Especially since you\u2019re offering yourself so willingly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I don\u2019t want you to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will.\u201d</p><p>The thing was that Peter did wanted to but there was still doubt in him. He looked away.</p><p>\u201cIs it?.. It\u2019s not just physical though, right? I mean I\u2019m not\u2026 I don\u2019t want to be your-\u201c</p><p>\u201cPeter, look at me.\u201d</p><p>There wasn\u2019t any game left in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not gonna say \u2018I love you\u2019 just to make you feel better because I don\u2019t but I do really <i>like</i> you and I don\u2019t believe you are in <i>love</i> with me either. I wanna make you mine. Look me in the eyes and tell me you don\u2019t want me too.\u201d</p><p>Instead, Peter kissed him. Maybe they didn\u2019t <i>love</i> each other yet but they were definitely getting there.</p>",

Ned looked at him sympathetically before leaving. Peter was so not looking forward to a conversation he was about to have with the teacher. Finally, after everybody left, Peter was standing in front of the teacher&rsquo;s desk.</p><p>&ldquo;Ok, Peter, I&rsquo;m gonna get straight to the point. I was talking to Banner about you. He was bragging to me about some formula you created. To which I said that it wasn&rsquo;t surprising at all and you could do even more if you weren&rsquo;t daydreaming during lessons. And then suddenly I discovered that the only lessons you are not paying attention to are mine. So tell me, Peter, what makes me so special? And there better be a damn good reason because I&rsquo;m leaning towards getting offended and trust me you don&rsquo;t want to get on my bad side.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter was starting to panic. He couldn&rsquo;t just tell things how they were. He couldn&rsquo;t say that he was impossibly infatuated with the man. That whenever he paid close attention to his voice, to his movements, to him in general he got lost. All he could think about is kissing him and feeling his hands touching his body. He could just imagine Mr Stark&rsquo;s strong hands lifting him on to the desk. Peter would wrap his legs around him and then tilt his head back. He hoped Mr Stark would leave bite marks on his neck&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;Earth to Peter. I want an explanation. And I&rsquo;m warning you, Parker, I&rsquo;m not a patient man.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter almost moaned at that. He decided he didn&rsquo;t care anymore. This had to stop one way or the other. He leaned on the desk and planted a brief kiss on Mr Stark&rsquo;s lips.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t handle NOT ignoring you. Every time I do I&rsquo;m losing my freaking mind. I thought it would be alright since I&rsquo;m pretty good with physics anyway but I guess it&rsquo;s not,&rdquo; he felt tears in the corners of his eyes and blinked them away. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll transfer from your class. I&rsquo;m sorry I fell for you.&rdquo;</p><p>He practically ran out of the class.</p><p>Tony touched his lips and smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;Interesting.&rdquo;</p><p>-</p><p>Tony knew someone just came up to his desk. He also had a pretty good idea of who that someone might be so he decided to ignore it. He could almost physically feel Peter&rsquo;s nervousness. After a couple of minutes, he finally took pity on the kid.</p><p>&ldquo;What is it, Peter? I haven&rsquo;t got all day.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry. I just&hellip; I need you to sign this. Please.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony looked at the boy. Peter shifted uncomfortably and handed him the form. Tony looked through it briefly. As he suspected it was a transfer file. He crushed the paper and with one precise throw sent it in the bin.</p><p>&ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter looked at him dumbfounded.</p><p>&ldquo;Why did you do this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought you were supposed to be smart. Figure it out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You can go now.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony got back to his work. After a while, he heard Peter walking away.</p><p>-</p><p>After a month Peter came to a decision that Mr Stark wanted payback. He was asking him something every couple of minutes, making sure Peter paid attention. Sometimes he just asked him to repeat what he has just said, other times it was some kind of a trick question &ndash; those tend to be hard. He made a habit of asking him to stay after class to see if he was taking notes. In other words, he made sure he had Peter&rsquo;s full attention during class. And Peter was going crazy. Tony would ask him to solve something at the board and then stand behind him talking right into his ear. He took every opportunity he had to touch him. He could place a hand on his shoulder or on his back while leaning over his desk to see what he was doing, he even ruffled his hair a couple of times. Nobody seemed to make much of it. Ned thought he was just finally tired of the way Peter acted so he took matters into his own hands. But Peter was sure there was something else going on. He couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about Tony Stark.</p><p>-</p><p>Peter was standing near his locker bracing himself for his next class &ndash; physics. Mr Stark was standing across the hallway. Peter could only see his back but he knew the man was in a good mood. Which probably meant more suffering for Peter.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t realise he was starring until Mr Stark looked at him with a slightly raised eyebrow. Peter blushed and turned away. He took a deep breath and closed the locker. Mr Stark was standing right behind him.</p><p>&ldquo;Hate to tell you this, Parker, but they still haven&rsquo;t invented laser eyes so you can stop trying to burn a hole in me with your beautiful eyes.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter blushed and thought he should really stop blushing at everything Mr Stark says to him.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not&hellip; I wasn't&hellip; I just&hellip; What are you trying to do?&rdquo;</p><p>Mr Stark smiled like he won something and for the first time ever Peter was scared of him. He had a suspicion Mr Stark was counting his question as defeat.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know what I mean. What do you want from me? Are you bored or something? I&rsquo;m not your toy.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony leaned in and breathed out a small little word right into Peter&rsquo;s ear.</p><p>&ldquo;Yet.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s eyes flew wide open. Tony took a step back.</p><p>&ldquo;You have a decathlon practice after school tomorrow. Come to see me after you&rsquo;re done.&rdquo;</p><p>He waited for Peter to nod and went away. The rest of the day was a blur to Peter.</p><p>-</p><p>Peter didn&rsquo;t know how long he has stood there in front of Mr Stark&rsquo;s class before finally opening the door. The man was going through some papers and didn&rsquo;t even look up.</p><p>&ldquo;Lock the door.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter froze.</p><p>&ldquo;W-why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m not gonna lose my job because of you.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter hesitated but after a moment he did what he was told. He looked at the man who put away the papers and beckoned him to come closer. Peter stopped in front of him not knowing what he was supposed to do. No matter how hard he tried he couldn&rsquo;t figure Mr Stark out.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know why you are here?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony put his hands on Peter&rsquo;s thighs and guided him to sit on his lap. Peter exhaled sharply instinctively putting his hands on the man&rsquo;s shoulders.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&hellip; I&rsquo;m not sure.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s cute.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t&hellip; why would you?..&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Parker, you need to start paying attention. Consider this for a second: do you think I would let just <i>anyone</i> slack off all of my classes? You&rsquo;re smart and beautiful and innocent and I&rsquo;m not going to pass on the opportunity to completely ruin you. Especially since you&rsquo;re offering yourself so willingly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And if I don&rsquo;t want you to?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You will.&rdquo;</p><p>The thing was that Peter did wanted to but there was still doubt in him. He looked away.</p><p>&ldquo;Is it?.. It&rsquo;s not just physical though, right? I mean I&rsquo;m not&hellip; I don&rsquo;t want to be your-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Peter, look at me.&rdquo;</p><p>There wasn&rsquo;t any game left in his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not gonna say &lsquo;I love you&rsquo; just to make you feel better because I don&rsquo;t but I do really <i>like</i> you and I don&rsquo;t believe you are in <i>love</i> with me either. I wanna make you mine. Look me in the eyes and tell me you don&rsquo;t want me too.&rdquo;</p><p>Instead, Peter kissed him. Maybe they didn&rsquo;t <i>love</i> each other yet but they were definitely getting there.</p>",

Sure Downey doesn\u2019t have any more movies on his contract, but he may still show up sometimes. Maybe in the background of Captain America: Sam Wilson we see Tony talking to some vets and asking what they need and how he can best help and advocate for them. Maybe we see \u201cTony Stark\u2019s Food Desert Initiative\u201d pop up in the background of Spider-Man 3.

                "content": "<p><i>&ldquo;Tony, duck!&rdquo; Clint screamed but too late and only a second later he got hit by something and the lights went out. </i></p><p>With a groan he opened his eyes. It was dim around him and he frowned. When he got hit it was bright daylight and they were fighting in the streets of Chicago and now he lay in his own bed in the Stark Tower. </p><p>He sat up and looked around. The room was empty and he frowned a bit. Something was definitely wrong here. Usually, when he was injured, Clint wouldn&rsquo;t leave his side. But this time he wasn&rsquo;t here. And then he paled. What if&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;Jarvis,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Clint?&rdquo; </p><p>It was quiet in his bedroom and he just wanted to repeat his question when Jarvis answered. </p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me, sir, but&hellip; who?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Clint, Clint Barton,&rdquo; Tony said. &ldquo;You know, the man I&rsquo;m married to.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; Jarvis said slowly but he couldn&rsquo;t finish his sentence when the door was torn open and a woman came in. She yelped when she saw Tony, came over to him and hugged him. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh god, you&rsquo;re awake,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I was so worried.&rdquo; </p><p>Only moments later Steve and Natasha came in, too, and Cap actually seemed relieved to see him. But Tony had still no idea who that woman was who hugged him and that&rsquo;s why he asked her.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; she said and sat back. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you okay, Tony?&rdquo; Natasha asked and frowned. &ldquo;After-effects from the hit you took?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Tony shook his head. &ldquo;I just want to know who that is. And where&rsquo;s Clint?&rdquo; </p><p>Natasha and Steve shared a glance with the woman. </p><p>&ldquo;Tony, that&rsquo;s Beatrix,&rdquo; Steve said.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m your wife!&rdquo; the woman said the same moment. </p><p>&ldquo;What? No,&rdquo; Tony shook his head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&hellip; Clint! Where&rsquo;s Clint?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Who is this Clint you&rsquo;re talking about?&rdquo; The woman, Beatrix, wanted to know. </p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s my&hellip;&rdquo; he stopped when he saw the faces of all of them. Beatrix&rsquo;s expression darkened.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh god, please don&rsquo;t tell me you cheated on her again,&rdquo; Steve growled. </p><p>&ldquo;No, I&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know who you are, lady, and now it&rsquo;s enough of this shit, I want my husband.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Your&hellip; husband?&rdquo; Beatrix sobbed, slapped his face and ran out of the room. </p><p>&ldquo;Jarvis, find Clint!&rdquo; Tony demanded. </p><p>&ldquo;I need more data, sir,&rdquo; the AI said. </p><p>&ldquo;Barton, Clinton Francis, born in Iowa and my goddamn husband,&rdquo; Tony snapped. </p><p>Natasha came over to him and scrutinized him. &ldquo;Are you sure you feel well? And who is this Clint person you&rsquo;re always talking about?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What? He&rsquo;s your best friend and&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;My what?&rdquo; Nat frowned. &ldquo;Tony, my best friend is Phil and you know that. He recruited me, remember?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; Jarvis interrupted them. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve searched for a Clinton Francis Barton but it seems there is no person with this name. Can I have more data?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;World&rsquo;s greatest marksman, an archer, former circus artist, brother Barney&hellip; Charles Bernard and&hellip;&rdquo; he stopped and glared at Steve and Natasha. There was something&hellip; something&hellip; </p><p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he asked and squinted his eyes. He rose from the bed and then he saw it. Steve was too short beside Natasha. </p><p>Tony&rsquo;s mouth went dry in an instant. </p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean? We&rsquo;re&hellip;&rdquo; Natasha said but Tony interrupted her.</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he shook his head. &ldquo;You look like them, but you are not Steve and Natasha!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Tony,&rdquo; Natasha said carefully but Tony had to get away and he had to get away fast. He waited till she made a step in his direction and then he just ran, bodychecked her out of the way - and now he was sure that this wasn&rsquo;t the real Natasha - and ran to the door. Steve tried to stop him but Tony whirled around and punched him while an alarm started to wail. The Steve impersonator staggered back and Tony reached for the handle again but now the fake Natasha tried to grab his arm.
