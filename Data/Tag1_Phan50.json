Even if the Age of Darkness didn\u2019t ruin his body for the world, he spent too many years under a dark sky to get used to how bright it is now. Some days, just for a moment, when his eyes sting and he wants to ignore the still unfamiliar world, he wonders if it\u2019s actually better.</p><p>But then Phil groans next to him, stretching out so his leg rubs against the entire length of Dan\u2019s. He reaches out, still half asleep and fully clumsy, and just about smacks Dan in the face.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t wanna get up,\u201d he grumbles.</p><p>Dan cracks a smile, eyes still closed. He so wishes he could reach over, wrap an arm around Phil and huddle in bed like he\u2019s never really been able to. That was the point of ending the Age of Darkness, right? \u00a0To live a simple, happy life, without monsters or war or the constant burden of blackness.</p><p>That\u2019s not what it is, though, not yet. Not for them.</p><p>There\u2019s a whole world to rebuild. And by some miracle, he and Phil get to be a part of it.</p><p>\u201cHave to,\u201d says Dan. \u201cWe have a workshop to run or whatever.\u201d</p><p>Phil grumbles. \u201cFuck the workshop.\u201d</p><p>Dan chuckles, low and still a little sleepy. When he finally cracks his eyes open, he sees even Phil is smiling, head half pressed into the pillow. The sun paints streaks across his cheek, gleams in his hair, as dark as the sky used to be. Dan leans over, presses a kiss to Phil\u2019s cheek, and decides that mornings like these are worth all the hassle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna get coffee from Django\u2019s, okay? We have a bunch of furniture to make today.\u201d</p><p>Phil grunts, but his smile quirks at the corner of his mouth.</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>They drink coffee in bed, tucked under a scratchy blanket made of wool.</p><p>There\u2019s a sofa in the corner, but it\u2019s old and the cushions are squished and Dan can\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019s sat on it. Across the room, there\u2019s the first dining set they\u2019d ever made, one table leg balancing on a book from before the Age of Darkness, and all the chairs so wobbly Phil claims they make him dizzy.</p><p>Part of Dan thinks it\u2019s just a ploy to stay tucked in bed a little while longer.</p><p>His foot nudges against Phil\u2019s. \u201cWe should add walls,\u201d he says, \u201cwhen we get better at this whole building thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we fix the existing ones first?\u201d</p><p>Dan shrugs. There\u2019s been holes in the walls since they moved in, when an old man who\u2019d been leading the rebuilding efforts had looked at them and said: <i> You\u2019re big boys. You could run a workshop. </i></p><p>The house was built hastily. They all were, dotting the landscape in places where the ground wasn\u2019t ravaged by monsters, littered with the remnants of the world that once was.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind them,\u201d he says.</p><p>Phil chuckles. \u201cThat\u2019s cause you\u2019re always warm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never complained.\u201d</p><p>Phil smiles. Under the blanket, his leg loops over Dan\u2019s. Back in the Age of Darkness, this is the type of day they\u2019d have spent in bed, ignoring the horror \u00a0of the world outside just to spend time with each other.</p><p>Now, they have a job to do, friends to help, a community to maintain. The world is hardly recognizable.</p><p>\u201cMaybe this summer,\u201d says Phil. \u201cThey say it\u2019s gonna keep being warmer, the longer the light\u2019s back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll be glad for the breeze, you spoon.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s face scrunches up. He reaches over, shoves at Dan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cAnd you just want to leave the holes there cause you know it\u2019ll be <i> your </i>job to fix them, you oaf.\u201d</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>Dan squeezes into the one pair of jeans he owns.</p><p>Across the room, Phil does the same, pulling a shirt over his head and rolling his shoulders. Dan knows he\u2019s sore. They both are. It\u2019s only been a few months and his body still isn\u2019t used to having gone from hiding away in dark corners of the only safe places they could find to running a workshop, and all the work that comes with that.</p><p>There\u2019s an axe leaning against the wall outside their house. Dan\u2019s the only one who uses it.</p><p>Neither one of them are built for construction. Dan\u2019s heard the stories of the technology that existed before the Age of Darkness, about artificial intelligence and robots and automated work. The Church of Light, up on the hill, talks about how that\u2019s what caused the Age of Darkness.</p><p>Dan thinks he would have been one of the people who relied on robots to do his work.</p><p>Phil probably would have been, too.</p><p>He checks the furnaces and their material supplies, as Dan throws the axe over his shoulder and prepares to head out. It still feels unnatural in his hand. He\u2019s not sure that\u2019ll ever change.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s good,\u201d says Phil. \u201cYou ready to go?\u201d</p><p>When they first started, every morning began with <i> I\u2019m coming with you. </i></p><p>That\u2019s what it used to be like. No one went anywhere alone. After years of watching people leave and never come home, neither of them were quite used to feeling safe. Phil still doesn\u2019t feel safe, though he\u2019ll only say so in the privacy of their home, when the sky is dark, though never as much as it used to be.</p><p>Today, his hand curls around Dan\u2019s arm, and he lets Dan lead him off towards the forest.</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>Dan\u2019s toes ache as he jams them into a tree.</p><p>It\u2019s on purpose. Phil watches, then stares up at the leaves to watch a single apple fall from the branches. It hits the ground with a thud, probably bruises on one side.</p><p>Phil still grins as he takes the first bite. Dan moans as he takes the second.</p><p>They sit at the bottom of the tree. There\u2019s a pile of wood they\u2019ve lugged across the forest next to them. Dan\u2019s hands ache from holding the axe. His back aches from carrying things.</p><p>He passes the apple back to Phil and smiles up at the sky.</p><p>The sun is high now, peeking out from between bright white clouds. They used to be black, like the ash that lays at the bottom of the furnaces back home. The apples used to be sour, unripe. People would bring them back to camp and dry them in bags, ration them and hand them out to each family.</p><p>Phil passes the apple back. Dan moans around this bite, too, watching Phil roll his eyes.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m allowed to like fruit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all like fruit,\u201d says Phil. \u201cYou\u2019re the only one who needs to get a room with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOi.\u201d He tosses the apple. It misses Phil, rolling across the grass. Phil just laughs. He picks up the apple, plucks a few blades of grass from where they\u2019ve eaten, and takes another bite.</p><p>There\u2019s probably a dozen more up in the tree, but wasting food still doesn\u2019t feel like an option.</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>Dan\u2019s exhausted by the time they get back.</p><p>He shoves the wood into their pile, accumulated slowly over months of rebuilding, and lies down in the middle of their garden. It tickles his ears, itches under the edge of his tunic.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t care. It\u2019s bright green again and today is the type of day when he wants to just enjoy it.</p><p>Phil refreshes the fuel in the furnaces. He organizes their collection of materials into chests, and sets Dan\u2019s tools by the door. When he goes to start working on their latest project, a set of stools for the park, Dan grins.</p><p>\u201cKnow what\u2019s hot?\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cYour dashing boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d says Dan, popping the p. \u201cThe furnaces.\u201d</p><p>Phil looks over his shoulder, squinting. \u201cRude.\u201d</p><p>He goes back to his work. Dan\u2019s teeth dig into his lower lip, privately watching the way Phil\u2019s shoulders flex as he works. His body\u2019s grown stronger since they started, his arms bulging more, his stomach more lean. A side effect of all the work, probably, now that they don\u2019t spend their time tucked away in safe houses.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d says Dan.</p><p>\u201cWe have commissions to fill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t care,\u201d he says. \u201cThe new park can wait. I want to watch the sunset with my hot boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>Phil chuckles. On another day, he might be adamant that they finish their work.</p><p>\u201cOh so now that you want to make out, I\u2019m hot, huh?\u201d</p><p>Dan grins. Phil\u2019s already set down his tools. He turns around, smiles back.</p><p>Today, it doesn\u2019t take much coaxing to get Phil to lay down on the ground. He tucks his head against Dan\u2019s shoulder, drapes an arm over his middle.</p><p>Night is starting to fall. Phil doesn\u2019t complain about Dan being warm, not now.</p><p>They don\u2019t say a word, watching the sky swirl in shades of pink and orange.</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>Work stays undone. The wood pile is crooked and might tumble in the wind. The furnaces don\u2019t get refueled.</p><p>Phil lies next to him, naked, tucked under their itchy wool blanket. His breaths are slow, steady. Dan knows he\u2019s already fallen asleep.</p><p>Dan doesn\u2019t fall asleep quite so easily.</p><p>There was a time when he spent every night waiting up for a monster to break into their home, steal the fragile stability they\u2019d built. The darkness was all they\u2019d ever known, in all it\u2019s terrifying obscurity.</p><p>Some days, Dan misses it.</p><p>Some nights, he wraps his arms tighter around Phil, and worries the black sky means the Age of Darkness will return.</p><p>He presses a kiss to Phil\u2019s head. The only response is a sigh.</p><p>It\u2019s enough to have Dan smiling as he closes his eyes.</p>",

Even if the Age of Darkness didn\u2019t ruin his body for the world, he spent too many years under a dark sky to get used to how bright it is now. Some days, just for a moment, when his eyes sting and he wants to ignore the still unfamiliar world, he wonders if it\u2019s actually better.</p><p>But then Phil groans next to him, stretching out so his leg rubs against the entire length of Dan\u2019s. He reaches out, still half asleep and fully clumsy, and just about smacks Dan in the face.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t wanna get up,\u201d he grumbles.</p><p>Dan cracks a smile, eyes still closed. He so wishes he could reach over, wrap an arm around Phil and huddle in bed like he\u2019s never really been able to. That was the point of ending the Age of Darkness, right? \u00a0To live a simple, happy life, without monsters or war or the constant burden of blackness.</p><p>That\u2019s not what it is, though, not yet. Not for them.</p><p>There\u2019s a whole world to rebuild. And by some miracle, he and Phil get to be a part of it.</p><p>\u201cHave to,\u201d says Dan. \u201cWe have a workshop to run or whatever.\u201d</p><p>Phil grumbles. \u201cFuck the workshop.\u201d</p><p>Dan chuckles, low and still a little sleepy. When he finally cracks his eyes open, he sees even Phil is smiling, head half pressed into the pillow. The sun paints streaks across his cheek, gleams in his hair, as dark as the sky used to be. Dan leans over, presses a kiss to Phil\u2019s cheek, and decides that mornings like these are worth all the hassle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna get coffee from Django\u2019s, okay? We have a bunch of furniture to make today.\u201d</p><p>Phil grunts, but his smile quirks at the corner of his mouth.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>They drink coffee in bed, tucked under a scratchy blanket made of wool.</p><p>There\u2019s a sofa in the corner, but it\u2019s old and the cushions are squished and Dan can\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019s sat on it. Across the room, there\u2019s the first dining set they\u2019d ever made, one table leg balancing on a book from before the Age of Darkness, and all the chairs so wobbly Phil claims they make him dizzy.</p><p>Part of Dan thinks it\u2019s just a ploy to stay tucked in bed a little while longer.</p><p>His foot nudges against Phil\u2019s. \u201cWe should add walls,\u201d he says, \u201cwhen we get better at this whole building thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we fix the existing ones first?\u201d</p><p>Dan shrugs. There\u2019s been holes in the walls since they moved in, when an old man who\u2019d been leading the rebuilding efforts had looked at them and said: <i> You\u2019re big boys. You could run a workshop. </i></p><p>The house was built hastily. They all were, dotting the landscape in places where the ground wasn\u2019t ravaged by monsters, littered with the remnants of the world that once was.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind them,\u201d he says.</p><p>Phil chuckles. \u201cThat\u2019s cause you\u2019re always warm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never complained.\u201d</p><p>Phil smiles. Under the blanket, his leg loops over Dan\u2019s. Back in the Age of Darkness, this is the type of day they\u2019d have spent in bed, ignoring the horror \u00a0of the world outside just to spend time with each other.</p><p>Now, they have a job to do, friends to help, a community to maintain. The world is hardly recognizable.</p><p>\u201cMaybe this summer,\u201d says Phil. \u201cThey say it\u2019s gonna keep being warmer, the longer the light\u2019s back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll be glad for the breeze, you spoon.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s face scrunches up. He reaches over, shoves at Dan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cAnd you just want to leave the holes there cause you know it\u2019ll be <i> your </i>job to fix them, you oaf.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>Dan squeezes into the one pair of jeans he owns.</p><p>Across the room, Phil does the same, pulling a shirt over his head and rolling his shoulders. Dan knows he\u2019s sore. They both are. It\u2019s only been a few months and his body still isn\u2019t used to having gone from hiding away in dark corners of the only safe places they could find to running a workshop, and all the work that comes with that.</p><p>There\u2019s an axe leaning against the wall outside their house. Dan\u2019s the only one who uses it.</p><p>Neither one of them are built for construction. Dan\u2019s heard the stories of the technology that existed before the Age of Darkness, about artificial intelligence and robots and automated work. The Church of Light, up on the hill, talks about how that\u2019s what caused the Age of Darkness.</p><p>Dan thinks he would have been one of the people who relied on robots to do his work.</p><p>Phil probably would have been, too.</p><p>He checks the furnaces and their material supplies, as Dan throws the axe over his shoulder and prepares to head out. It still feels unnatural in his hand. He\u2019s not sure that\u2019ll ever change.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s good,\u201d says Phil. \u201cYou ready to go?\u201d</p><p>When they first started, every morning began with <i> I\u2019m coming with you. </i></p><p>That\u2019s what it used to be like. No one went anywhere alone. After years of watching people leave and never come home, neither of them were quite used to feeling safe. Phil still doesn\u2019t feel safe, though he\u2019ll only say so in the privacy of their home, when the sky is dark, though never as much as it used to be.</p><p>Today, his hand curls around Dan\u2019s arm, and he lets Dan lead him off towards the forest.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>Dan\u2019s toes ache as he jams them into a tree.</p><p>It\u2019s on purpose. Phil watches, then stares up at the leaves to watch a single apple fall from the branches. It hits the ground with a thud, probably bruises on one side.</p><p>Phil still grins as he takes the first bite. Dan moans as he takes the second.</p><p>They sit at the bottom of the tree. There\u2019s a pile of wood they\u2019ve lugged across the forest next to them. Dan\u2019s hands ache from holding the axe. His back aches from carrying things.</p><p>He passes the apple back to Phil and smiles up at the sky.</p><p>The sun is high now, peeking out from between bright white clouds. They used to be black, like the ash that lays at the bottom of the furnaces back home. The apples used to be sour, unripe. People would bring them back to camp and dry them in bags, ration them and hand them out to each family.</p><p>Phil passes the apple back. Dan moans around this bite, too, watching Phil roll his eyes.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m allowed to like fruit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all like fruit,\u201d says Phil. \u201cYou\u2019re the only one who needs to get a room with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOi.\u201d He tosses the apple. It misses Phil, rolling across the grass. Phil just laughs. He picks up the apple, plucks a few blades of grass from where they\u2019ve eaten, and takes another bite.</p><p>There\u2019s probably a dozen more up in the tree, but wasting food still doesn\u2019t feel like an option.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>Dan\u2019s exhausted by the time they get back.</p><p>He shoves the wood into their pile, accumulated slowly over months of rebuilding, and lies down in the middle of their garden. It tickles his ears, itches under the edge of his tunic.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t care. It\u2019s bright green again and today is the type of day when he wants to just enjoy it.</p><p>Phil refreshes the fuel in the furnaces. He organizes their collection of materials into chests, and sets Dan\u2019s tools by the door. When he goes to start working on their latest project, a set of stools for the park, Dan grins.</p><p>\u201cKnow what\u2019s hot?\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cYour dashing boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d says Dan, popping the p. \u201cThe furnaces.\u201d</p><p>Phil looks over his shoulder, squinting. \u201cRude.\u201d</p><p>He goes back to his work. Dan\u2019s teeth dig into his lower lip, privately watching the way Phil\u2019s shoulders flex as he works. His body\u2019s grown stronger since they started, his arms bulging more, his stomach more lean. A side effect of all the work, probably, now that they don\u2019t spend their time tucked away in safe houses.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d says Dan.</p><p>\u201cWe have commissions to fill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t care,\u201d he says. \u201cThe new park can wait. I want to watch the sunset with my hot boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>Phil chuckles. On another day, he might be adamant that they finish their work.</p><p>\u201cOh so now that you want to make out, I\u2019m hot, huh?\u201d</p><p>Dan grins. Phil\u2019s already set down his tools. He turns around, smiles back.</p><p>Today, it doesn\u2019t take much coaxing to get Phil to lay down on the ground. He tucks his head against Dan\u2019s shoulder, drapes an arm over his middle.</p><p>Night is starting to fall. Phil doesn\u2019t complain about Dan being warm, not now.</p><p>They don\u2019t say a word, watching the sky swirl in shades of pink and orange.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>Work stays undone. The wood pile is crooked and might tumble in the wind. The furnaces don\u2019t get refueled.</p><p>Phil lies next to him, naked, tucked under their itchy wool blanket. His breaths are slow, steady. Dan knows he\u2019s already fallen asleep.</p><p>Dan doesn\u2019t fall asleep quite so easily.</p><p>There was a time when he spent every night waiting up for a monster to break into their home, steal the fragile stability they\u2019d built. The darkness was all they\u2019d ever known, in all it\u2019s terrifying obscurity.</p><p>Some days, Dan misses it.</p><p>Some nights, he wraps his arms tighter around Phil, and worries the black sky means the Age of Darkness will return.</p><p>He presses a kiss to Phil\u2019s head. The only response is a sigh.</p><p>It\u2019s enough to have Dan smiling as he closes his eyes.</p>",
