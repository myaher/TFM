But it feels so out of place still because it\u2019s not only that Eve and Niko are not on the same wavelength anymore (Pythagoras vs Newton) but that\nthe tiniest thing outside of that fake-passionate-Niko-Eve bubble \nmanages to disrupt the entire moment, and in Eve\u2019s mind it\u2019s always tied to <i>Villanelle</i> because Villanelle has planted the seeds she needed to plant in order to occupy all of Eve\u2019s brain, hence the title \u201cThe Hungry Caterpillar\u201d. <br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"286\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d972c5af7a5ac9b90ea0f0f47d1be44a/tumblr_inline_pq9rd88Szn1u32w7v_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"286\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"467\" data-orig-height=\"263\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c28c250372e93349cf1e6a5fe71f155f/tumblr_inline_pq9rd0TcCt1u32w7v_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"467\" data-orig-height=\"263\"/></figure><p>In fact, it goes even further, to the point that Eve\u2019s feelings for Villanelle spike her senses so high that she blares the freaking alarm in case of an Emergency, which is not as much an Emergency for Eve as it is a way closer to having her own desires fulfilled because Eve knows what she wants for herself even if she cannot admit it yet.

Which, by the way, further intensifies the utter lack of passion and intimacy between them.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"284\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2a6637bc6b10eae2254b10c19bfc4c7a/tumblr_inline_pqc1w4RnbE1u32w7v_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"284\"/></figure><p>Which brings me to the lipstick, or&hellip; INDIRECT KISS.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"310\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1f9271425e70d7d699bf965539abcfed/tumblr_inline_pq9s9awUJQ1u32w7v_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"310\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"305\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/328888b57b64f44ba06b694f3aa48331/tumblr_inline_pq9s9g7jSa1u32w7v_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"305\"/></figure><p>There is a moment where Eve truly asks herself, \u201cWhat if it was just an apple?\u201d, starting to doubt in which ways she read the scene. But leave it to Villanelle to give Eve the signs she needs. The communication between them is heavy with a charged, clean distance, but it\u2019s passionate nonetheless because \nTouch is important metaphorically already, and contact is an honest, loaded proposition.\n\n<br/></p><p> Villanelle - in this case - satisfies Eve on two fronts; 1. her job, the lipstick being the giveaway for the Lift Kill, and 2. that she wants Eve for herself, which is more of an invitation than a threat for Eve to be honest as Villanelle remains the one thing she wants in life as well. All this happens without a second thought too, the primal instinct hurtling them both towards an uncontrollable obsession which is evident in both of their actions (the Konstantin-family affair and Student-Teacher complaints). So one has to wonder, when you faciliate your feelings for someone that long without absolute fulfillment it would be of no surprise if both sides felt like collapsing when only a door kept them apart&hellip;</p><p>Right?

This almost physical contact is so important because they both enjoy <i>reveling</i> in this playfulness (Villanelle\u2019s giggles?), this search and pageantry (and it\u2019s darker incarnation) and that Eve\u2019s relationship with Villanelle is further realized. <br/></p><p>So, from a thematic standpoint it is intense already, but it\u2019s also an emotionally indirect-direct sexual experience because here the chemistry is just <i>right</i>, worthy of teasing and pleasure and no-holds-barred comfort in one another\u2019s company. This is explicitly labeled as sensual! Of course Niko doesn\u2019t stand a chance! And the urgency? To get closer but knowing all too well that no, not yet (Villanelle runs)? It\u2019s exciting because Villanelle doesn\u2019t keep Eve hanging, with the lipstick and one last hidden message that Eve literally gets to taste:</p><figure data-orig-width=\"793\" data-orig-height=\"451\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fd6d8fc9b2418da661fada5b8160fada/tumblr_inline_pq9tzxArYe1u32w7v_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"793\" data-orig-height=\"451\"/></figure><p>SHE DIDNT HAVE TO TOUCH HER LIP LIKE THAT BUT OKAY<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna screw you,\u201d tell me who is gonna screw who.

The thing is that Eve eats Villanelle just as much and I truly think that is like. Beautiful, you know? because KDSJAKSJHAKJHDJKAHDJKSA-<br/></p>",

And thirdly, the fact that there hasn&rsquo;t been much, if at all, focus on Niko&rsquo;s unsatisfaction in S1 but that &ldquo;The Hungry Caterpillar&rdquo; brings forward where his own desires are unfulfilled, and how Eve trades her intimacy with Niko for Villanelle; e.g when Niko comments on masturbating on his omelette, which Eve made, we have Villanelle say this in the scene that follows:<br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e5e2c4306027e9e3176532099013665e/tumblr_inline_pq9phkI1xq1u32w7v_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/28ff78159cf71b0d6200caf8909be808/tumblr_inline_pq9ph78Ear1u32w7v_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Villanelle&rsquo;s disgust aside, this is actually an amazing &ldquo;statement&rdquo; because who is busy leaving semen stains on things such as his bed? Niko. On a metatextual level seven plus stains would highlight just how removed Eve is from satisfying her husband, to the point that he has to ask for It, &ldquo;If you wanted to show me your devotion&hellip;&rdquo;, because she won&rsquo;t bring sex up anymore (see: 1x01). It&rsquo;s the one thing that he clearly means to hold onto, seeing as their marriage crumbles and his invitation doesn&rsquo;t work because Eve&rsquo;s head is, again, somewhere else. That&rsquo;s very fascinating to me because we watch her make propositions with food, &ldquo;I just wanted to be nice&rdquo;, which highlight her own hunger for something she cannot put her hands on yet, and in a way completely opposite from S1 (Eve being on her way to getting closer to Villanelle with the knowledge that whatever connection, affair they have is tied to Love and Death), but it also shows that whatever people tell Eve she still has &ldquo;worth having&rdquo;, it has fallen apart already, with little to no space left for her to do something to keep it intact. <br /></p><p>This spiel continues when Niko tells Eve to wear a &ldquo;slutty dress&rdquo;, which is quite the comment considering at what point he and Eve are in their relationship. It&rsquo;s an action of transaction again, or how to keep things fresh and entertaining. <br /></p><p>But it completely backfires left and right because he doesn&rsquo;t care about the dress and Eve doesn&rsquo;t actually care about what a Teacher might go through at school. So with all air out they are left with even more miscommunication.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e161a21b236249d48c4fd62c84459b2a/tumblr_inline_pq9r4fY6Pd1u32w7v_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9529ce7d78cf280ac1c5f0cb04933429/tumblr_inline_pq9r4llt9H1u32w7v_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Which is truly curious because even though Eve wouldn&rsquo;t think of sex during the bed scene, we see her try to seduce Niko at the University - &ldquo;show me your classroom, sir&rdquo; - because of how much the situation ramps up the possible student-teacher affair. But it feels so out of place still because it&rsquo;s not only that Eve and Niko are not on the same wavelength anymore (Pythagoras vs Newton) but that\nthe tiniest thing outside of that fake-passionate-Niko-Eve bubble \nmanages to disrupt the entire moment, and in Eve&rsquo;s mind it&rsquo;s always tied to <i>Villanelle</i> because Villanelle has planted the seeds she needed to plant in order to occupy all of Eve&rsquo;s brain, hence the title &ldquo;The Hungry Caterpillar&rdquo;. <br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d972c5af7a5ac9b90ea0f0f47d1be44a/tumblr_inline_pq9rd88Szn1u32w7v_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c28c250372e93349cf1e6a5fe71f155f/tumblr_inline_pq9rd0TcCt1u32w7v_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>In fact, it goes even further, to the point that Eve&rsquo;s feelings for Villanelle spike her senses so high that she blares the freaking alarm in case of an Emergency, which is not as much an Emergency for Eve as it is a way closer to having her own desires fulfilled because Eve knows what she wants for herself even if she cannot admit it yet. This, of course, leaves Niko completely hanging once more:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/78be2fe940f1b640da76c7877b9f1eac/tumblr_inline_pq9s2d90Iz1u32w7v_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/96c56446906af7bc6e35c2987886424e/tumblr_inline_pq9s2lFmRI1u32w7v_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>(I doubt he will come, Eve DJKAHKSJAKDJSAKDJSA)</p><p>And then he leaves with Gemma by his side - &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to be here&rdquo;. Niko&rsquo;s observation is correct and it takes shape in actual physical form - distance - as Eve spends her time outside the bed, thinking about Villanelle, whereas Niko has a dream &ldquo;need to file them alphabetically&rdquo;. Which, by the way, further intensifies the utter lack of passion and intimacy between them.<br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2a6637bc6b10eae2254b10c19bfc4c7a/tumblr_inline_pqc1w4RnbE1u32w7v_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Which brings me to the lipstick, or&hellip; INDIRECT KISS.<br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1f9271425e70d7d699bf965539abcfed/tumblr_inline_pq9s9awUJQ1u32w7v_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/328888b57b64f44ba06b694f3aa48331/tumblr_inline_pq9s9g7jSa1u32w7v_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>There is a moment where Eve truly asks herself, &ldquo;What if it was just an apple?&rdquo;, starting to doubt in which ways she read the scene. But leave it to Villanelle to give Eve the signs she needs. The communication between them is heavy with a charged, clean distance, but it&rsquo;s passionate nonetheless because \nTouch is important metaphorically already, and contact is an honest, loaded proposition.\n\n<br /></p><p> Villanelle - in this case - satisfies Eve on two fronts; 1. her job, the lipstick being the giveaway for the Lift Kill, and 2. that she wants Eve for herself, which is more of an invitation than a threat for Eve to be honest as Villanelle remains the one thing she wants in life as well. All this happens without a second thought too, the primal instinct hurtling them both towards an uncontrollable obsession which is evident in both of their actions (the Konstantin-family affair and Student-Teacher complaints). So one has to wonder, when you faciliate your feelings for someone that long without absolute fulfillment it would be of no surprise if both sides felt like collapsing when only a door kept them apart&hellip;</p><p>Right?

This almost physical contact is so important because they both enjoy <i>reveling</i> in this playfulness (Villanelle&rsquo;s giggles?), this search and pageantry (and it&rsquo;s darker incarnation) and that Eve&rsquo;s relationship with Villanelle is further realized. <br /></p><p>So, from a thematic standpoint it is intense already, but it&rsquo;s also an emotionally indirect-direct sexual experience because here the chemistry is just <i>right</i>, worthy of teasing and pleasure and no-holds-barred comfort in one another&rsquo;s company. This is explicitly labeled as sensual! Of course Niko doesn&rsquo;t stand a chance! And the urgency? To get closer but knowing all too well that no, not yet (Villanelle runs)? It&rsquo;s exciting because Villanelle doesn&rsquo;t keep Eve hanging, with the lipstick and one last hidden message that Eve literally gets to taste:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fd6d8fc9b2418da661fada5b8160fada/tumblr_inline_pq9tzxArYe1u32w7v_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>SHE DIDNT HAVE TO TOUCH HER LIP LIKE THAT BUT OKAY<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna screw you,&rdquo; tell me who is gonna screw who.

The thing is that Eve eats Villanelle just as much and I truly think that is like. Beautiful, you know? because KDSJAKSJHAKJHDJKAHDJKSA-<br /></p>",
