Ochadeku (I don\u2019t remember the ship name lmao) is also hella cute, but it isn\u2019t my favorite and even though it\u2019s super cute, I just like Iichacko better lmao.\u00a0</p>",

        "body": "<p><b>This was inspired by <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZJwO8AVOs48zctd4DaTF-A\">@maidsonas</a> \u2019s Half-Filipino</b><b>!Deku headcanons.</b></p><p>&mdash;\u00a0</p><p>It was Friday, and as the school day at UA High wound to a close, Class 1-A was busy packing up their things and getting ready to head home.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget, you all have a paper on Hero Law due Monday morning,\u201d Aizawa said as gathered up his sleeping bag. \u201cIf you haven\u2019t already, make sure you get started on it tonight. I don\u2019t want you up all night on Sunday trying to finish it.\u201d Before the students could say a word, Aizawa walked out the door.</p><p>After their teacher left, Izuku pulled out his phone and brought up a specific webpage, a huge smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cMidoriya, are you ready to go?\u201d a voice asked.</p><p>Izuku looked up to see Iida and Uraraka standing over his desk.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we don\u2019t want to miss the train, Deku,\u201d Uraraka said anxiously.</p><p>\u201cOh, actually, I wasn\u2019t going to head straight home today,\u201d Izuku said as he put away his phone. \u201cYou guys can head to the train stations without me.\u201d His friends looked at Izuku quizzically but said nothing.</p><p>\u201cIf you say so, Uraraka and I will head out,\u201d Iida said and then turned around.</p><p>Uraraka gave a wave and started walking towards the door with Iida.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Izuku said, stopping his friends in their tracks. They turned around and saw Izuku with a slight blush on his face. \u201cActually, would you guys like to go with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, go where?\u201d Uraraka asked.</p><p>Izuku rubbed the back of his head. \u201cIt\u2019s this new restaurant I want to try, I read about it online, and I was planning on going today. You don\u2019t have to come; I just thought I\u2019d ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I want to come, Deku,\u201d Uraraka said with a smile. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m starving after Hero training; I could use a bite to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like a wonderful idea,\u201d Iida said. \u201cI just need to contact my mother and tell her I\u2019ll be getting home later than normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome!\u201d Izuku exclaimed. He grabbed his bag and stood up. \u201cI\u2019m really excited to go; I\u2019m so glad you can come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, where are we going?\u201d A cool voice asked.</p><p>The three friends turned their heads to see Todoroki standing a few feet away.</p><p>\u201cUh\u2026what?\u201d Uraraka said.</p><p>\u201cYou said you were all going out to get food and I want to come with you,\u201d Todoroki said bluntly.</p><p>\u201cUm, sure, you can come, Todoroki,\u201d Izuku said. \u201cThe more, the merrier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it be alright if I came too, ribbit?\u201d a new voice said.</p><p>The four turned to Tsuyu standing a couple of feet away, a curious look on her face.</p><p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s fine,\u201d Izuku said. \u201cAny reason why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just hungry, and food always tastes better when you\u2019re with friends, ribbit,\u201d Tsuyu said.</p><p>\u201cAlright then,\u201d Izuku exclaimed. \u201cLet\u2019s get going!\u201d</p><p>As the five teens walked out of the school, a thought occurred to Todoroki. \u201cIida, where exactly are we going?\u201d</p><p>The blue haired teen rubbed his chin and thought. \u201cNow that you mention it, I don\u2019t know. We forgot to ask Midoriya what this restaurant is.\u201d</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here!\u201d Izuku shouted, practically vibrating with excitement.</p><p>Uraraka, Iida, Todoroki, and Tsuyu stood behind their friend giving him odd looks. The five UA students found themselves in front of a fast food restaurant with a bright exterior and a sign that said \u2018Jollibee\u2019 in chubby white lettering. Next to the door was a statue of a cartoon styled red bee wearing a vest, gloves, yellows shoes, and a chef\u2019s hat.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this place?\u201d Todoroki asked.</p><p>\u201cHow do you say that?\u201d Uraraka said. \u201cJole-ib-ee, Jalw-eeb-eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pronounced Jolly-Bee, you know, like a jolly bee,\u201d Izuku explained. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go in.\u201d He opened the doors and walked in, his friends right behind him. The interior had bright red and yellow walls, red chairs, and white tables. White counters lined the floor to ceiling window wall with yellow stools to sit on.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we waiting for, let\u2019s order our food,\u201d Izuku said before practically sprinting to the register.</p><p>\u201cHey, Deku, wait for us,\u201d Uraraka said. She, Todoroki, and Tsuyu followed after the green haired boy.</p><p>Iida was about to do the same, but then he noticed something. He stopped and looked around the restaurant, it was packed, and almost every seat was taken. And almost every customer appeared to be Filipino. In fact, he and his friends appeared to be the only Japanese people in the establishment.</p><p>\u2018Strange,\u2019 Iida thought. Before he could further contemplate this, he noticed Uraraka waving him over so they could place their orders.</p><p>\u201cOh man, it all looks so good,\u201d Izuku said, practically drooling as he looked over the menu. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m gonna get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you mean,\u201d Uraraka said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if I want a burger or chicken or-\u201d She cut herself off, her eyes wide with shock. \u201cDeku, look!\u201d She exclaimed grabbing Izuku by the shoulder. \u201cThey have red been pies! We have to get those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s new,\u201d Izuku said.</p><p>Iida raised an eyebrow at his statement. \u2018New? This restaurant just opened.\u2019 He shook his head and decided to save his questions for later.</p><p>\u201cYou can order whatever you desire; I\u2019ll gladly pay,\u201d Iida.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Tsuyu said. \u201cEven if it is fast food, that\u2019ll still be a lot of money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, allow me to pay. I don\u2019t want you all fretting about the price; this is supposed to be a nice day out.\u201d Iida smiled. \u201cBesides, as Midoriya and Uraraka have stated before, I\u2019m a \u2018rich kid\u2019 so it\u2019s honestly no trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome!\u201d \u00a0Izuku and Uraraka exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Iida,\u201d Tsuyu said.</p><p>\u201cThank, you,\u201d Todoroki said.</p><p>They turned to the cashier, whom Iida noticed was also Filipino. She smiled at the group and said \u201cHello, welcome to Jollibee. What can we get for you today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi there, I\u2019d like an Aloha Burger with garlic fries and a large drink, please,\u201d Izuku said. \u201cOh, and a Halo-Halo for dessert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I get the Fiesta Noodles with a drink, and a red been pie,\u201d Uraraka said.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll just get the hotdog and a drink,\u201d Todoroki said.</p><p>Tsuyu hummed to herself for a moment as she looked over the menu. \u201cI\u2019ll get the spaghetti with a side of corn and a medium drink. I\u2019d also like an Ube Pearl Cooler, ribbit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat all sounds excellent,\u201d Iida said before turning to the cashier. \u201cI would like the Burger Steak with rice and a drink please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright, will that be all for you kids today?\u201d the cashier said.</p><p>\u201cOh, Iida,\u201d Izuku exclaimed. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get any fried chicken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeg pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJollibee\u2019s fried chicken is amazing; we can\u2019t just come here and not get any. We should get a bucket to share.\u201d</p><p>Iida raised an eyebrow at his friend\u2019s statement. \u2018How does he know that?\u2019</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to try the chicken,\u201d Uraraka said, licking her lips. \u201cShould we get the regular or spicy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like spicy food, ribbit,\u201d Tsuyu said. \u201cCan we get the regular?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut their spicy chicken is amazing,\u201d Izuku said.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we just get both?\u201d Todoroki said. \u201cThat way everyone\u2019s happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Iida said contemplatively. \u201cNormally I\u2019d be against such excessive eating and spending.\u201d After a moment he smiled. \u201cBut since today is a special day I\u2019ll allow.\u201d He turned back to the cashier. \u201cWe\u2019d also like two buckets of chicken, one regular and one spicy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent, you total today comes to 7,106 Yen,\u201d the cashier said. Iida handed her his debit card, and she then reached over and grabbed a buzzer and handed it to Iida along with the card. \u201cYour food will be ready shortly. Have a jolly day.\u201d</p><p>After some searching, the five friends found a table and sat down to wait for their order. \u201cI\u2019m so excited,\u201d Izuku said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I want to eat more, the fried chicken or the burger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Deku,\u201d Uraraka said. \u201cWhat exactly is an Aloha Burger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s awesome!\u201d Izuku exclaimed, his eyes practically sparkling. \u201cIt\u2019s a burger with lettuce, tomato, cheese, honey mustard, lots of bacon, and a slice of grilled pineapple.\u201d He licked his lips as he envisioned the burger in his mind.</p><p>\u201cWow that does sound good,\u201d Uraraka said. \u201cI kind of wish I ordered that instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll love the Fiesta Noodles,\u201d Izuku said. \u201cEverything here is awesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, Midoriya,\u201d Iida said. \u201cBut may I ask you a question?\u201d</p><p>Izuku looked up at his friend and blinked in surprise. \u201cUh, sure. What is it, Iida?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, even though this restaurant just opened, you already appear to be very familiar with it, I\u2019m curious as to how?\u201d Iida asked. Izuku\u2019s body went stiff.</p><p>\u201cNow that I think about it, you seemed to really know your way around the menu when you ordered your food,\u201d Tsuyu said, placing her pointer finger on her chin.</p><p>\u201cAnd you were raving about their fried chicken even though this is your first time here,\u201d Todoroki.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah,\u201d Uraraka exclaimed. \u201cAnd you said that the Anko Pie was new, but this place only just opened.\u201d</p><p>Izuku let out a nervous laugh as he rubbed the back of his head. \u201cWell, the thing is, this isn\u2019t my first time at a Jollibee.\u201d</p><p>His four friends looked at him in confusion, wondering what exactly he was talking about.</p><p>\u201cYou see, Jollibee isn\u2019t just this place, it\u2019s a really popular chain of restaurants,\u201d Izuku said.</p><p>\u201cIf they\u2019re so popular, how come I\u2019ve never heard of them?\u201d Todoroki asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because this is their first Japanese location,\u201d Izuku explained. \u201cJollibee is actually a Filipino fast food chain, and they\u2019re really popular over there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I see,\u201d Todoroki said as he looked around. \u201cThat explains why all the staff and customers are Filipino.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d Uraraka said. \u201cIf it\u2019s a Filipino chain, then why do you know about it, Deku?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhm, I\u2019ve been to the Philippines before. A lot of times,\u201d Izuku said.</p><p>\u201cOh, your family likes to vacation in the Philippines?\u201d Iida asked.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d Izuku said. \u201cI\u2019m actually half-Filipino on my dad\u2019s side, so I\u2019ve got a lot of family over there.\u201d</p><p>His friends stared at him for a moment, their eyes wide as they tried to process what they\u2019d just heard.</p><p>\u201cWait, what,\u201d Uraraka said. \u201cYou are. How come you never said anything before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know; it just didn\u2019t seem important,\u201d Izuku said.</p><p>\u201cHold on, I think I remember you told us your dad\u2019s name was Hisashi,\u201d Tsuyu said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like a Filipino name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not actually,\u201d Izuku said. \u201cBut there\u2019s a reason. You see, my lola and lolo moved to Japan after they got married, and when they had my dad, they decided to give him a Japanese name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, Deku, what\u2019s a lola?\u201d Uraraka asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, lola and lolo is Filipino for grandma and grandpa,\u201d Izuku explained. \u201cThat\u2019s what I call them, and I call my mom\u2019s parent grandma and grandpa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they live close by?\u201d Tsuyu asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Izuku said. \u201cLola and lolo moved back to the Philippines after they retired, and that was when I was pretty young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, have you been to the Philippines a lot?\u201d Iida asked.</p><p>\u201cLoads of times. Every time we visit my mom and I stop at the Jollibee\u2019s at the airport, the manager even knows me by name.\u201d Izuku smiled as he recalled the memory.</p><p>\u201cCan you speak Filipinese?\u201d Uraraka asked.</p><p>Izuku laughed. \u201cThe language is called Filipino, and yes, I can. I\u2019m bilingual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoah, that\u2019s so cool,\u201d Uraraka said. \u201cI wish I could speak two languages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh that\u2019s nothing, you should see my lola,\u201d Izuku said. \u201cShe can speak five languages; Filipino, English, Spanish, Japanese, and Malay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemarkable,\u201d Iida said. \u201cTo be able to speak such a multitude of languages is an incredible achievement. Your lola sound like a wonderful person.\u201d</p><p>Izuku blushed.</p><p>\u201cMidoriya,\u201d Todoroki said, catching the green haired boy\u2019s attention. \u201cDid you not tell us about this because you were afraid?\u201d</p><p>The table went dead silent at Todoroki\u2019s question. Iida, Uraraka, and Tsuyu gaped at the bicolored teen in disbelief. Izuku, on the other hand, went completely rigged.</p><p>\u201cTodoroki!\u201d Iida yelled. \u201cThat kind of question is highly inappropriate. You should apologize to Midoriya at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIida, wait,\u201d Izuku said, holding up his hands in a placating motion. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, Todoroki\u2019s always been pretty blunt, and it\u2019s an honest question.\u201d He sighed. \u201cAnd to be honest, yeah. I\u2019ve always been a little apprehensive about telling people I\u2019m biracial. When I told my kindergarten class I was half-Filipino I got teased a lot for it and went on until elementary school. It stopped when I got to middle school, but I was afraid it might happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Deku,\u201d Uraraka said as she reached over to grip Izuku\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry that happened to you. I can\u2019t they would say stuff like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople can be jerks,\u201d Tsuyu said with a small scowl. \u201cI bet they didn\u2019t even try to get to know the real you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour former classmates\u2019 behavior was absolutely deplorable,\u201d Iida proclaimed. \u201cNo one should ever be belittled because of their heritage.\u201d</p><p>Todoroki nodded at Iida\u2019s statement. \u201cIf anyone tries that again just let me know.\u201d</p><p>Izuku stared at his friends in stunned silence, overwhelmed by their kind words. \u201cOh, you guys,\u201d Izuku said with a massive smile on his face. \u201cThank you all so much. No one\u2019s ever said that to me before; you\u2019re the greatest friends anyone could ask for.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, their buzzer started vibrating and flashing red. \u201cOh, that\u2019s our food,\u201d Iida said and got up. A minute later he came back with a tray piled high with a mountain.</p><p>\u201cWow this looks awesome,\u201d Uraraka said as she opened the box containing her Fiesta Noodles. \u201cAnd look at these tiny little shrimp, they\u2019re almost too cute to eat. Almost.\u201d</p><p>Todoroki eyed his hotdog suspiciously. \u201cWhy does my hotdog have cheese on it, and what\u2019s with the mustard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not mustard, it\u2019s cheese sauce,\u201d Izuku explained.</p><p>\u201cJust give it a try, Todoroki,\u201d Tsuyu said. \u201cThis spaghetti\u2019s got sliced up hotdog and ham in it, but I\u2019m willing to try it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright everyone, let\u2019s dig in,\u201d Iida said.</p><p>\u201cThank you for the meal!\u201d they said together before digging in.</p><p>\u201cOh my gosh, this tastes so good,\u201d Uraraka said with a look of bliss on her face. \u201cThis sauce is awesome!\u201d She happily slurped up another forkful of noodles with a smile.</p><p>Tsuyu speared of a piece of hotdog with her forkful spaghetti and brought it to her mouth. \u201cHuh, that\u2019s weird,\u201d she said with an unreadable expression. \u201cThis spaghetti tastes kind of sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the banana ketchup,\u201d Izuku explained after swallowing a bite of his burger. \u201cIt\u2019s a sauce made from mashed bananas and spices; people like to mix it with the marinara sauce in the Philippines. Filipino style spaghetti is kind of an acquired taste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I like, ribbit,\u201d Tsuyu said cheerfully. \u201cIt\u2019s different from the pasta I make for younger siblings; maybe I\u2019ll bring them some, ribbit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I am quite enjoying this burger steak,\u201d Iida said. \u201cThe gravy is delectable, and the meat is very tender.\u201d He scooped some rice and a bite of burger into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really glad you\u2019re all enjoying it,\u201d Izuku said. \u201cWhat about you, Todoroki, do you like the hotdog?\u201d</p><p>The bicolored teen was currently chewing on a piece of said hotdog and simply shrugged before swallowing. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t dislike it, but I wouldn\u2019t order it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh well, guess they can\u2019t all be winners,\u201d Izuku said with a sigh. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you try the chicken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Todoroki said, putting down his hotdog. He reached over and grabbed a piece of regular chicken and brought it to his mouth. He took a small bite and chewed slowly. Suddenly, his eyes lit up, and he started devouring the fried chicken in his hand. He licked his lips and said \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d before reaching over for another.</p><p>\u201cTodoroki, make sure you leave some for the rest of us,\u201d Tsuyu said with a pout.</p><p>Todoroki made an indiscernible noise with his mouth full of food.</p><p>Izuku let out a small laugh. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you try the spicy chicken next, Todoroki, so Tsuyu can try some?\u201d</p><p>As the afternoon went on, not a single scrap of food remained on their table, save for Todoroki\u2019s half-eaten hotdog. The five friends sat contently around their table, stuffed to burst with Jollibee\u2019s food.</p><p>\u201cOh man, those noodles were amazing,\u201d Uraraka said as she patted her stomach. \u201cAnd that red been pie was so good, I want to eat another, but I\u2019m too full.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re full, look at me,\u201d Izuku said. \u201cI barely managed to finish my Hola-Hola, I don\u2019t think I have enough room for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay, Midoriya, what is a Hola-Hola?\u201d Tsuyu asked. \u201cIt looked really good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s shaved ice and evaporated milk layered with sweet gelatin and fruit topped off with ice cream and a piece of flan,\u201d Izuku explained contently. \u201cIt\u2019s the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s sound delicious,\u201d Tsuyu said. \u201cI\u2019d love to try it, ribbit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on, I think we\u2019ve had more than enough to eat today,\u201d Iida said sternly. \u201cAs heroes in training, we shouldn\u2019t gorge ourselves on fast food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we could always just come back here next week,\u201d Todoroki said. \u201cI\u2019d like to try the noodles Uraraka got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a great idea,\u201d Uraraka exclaimed. \u201cHow about we do this every week, every Friday after school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds awesome,\u201d Izuku replied.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that, ribbit,\u201d Tsuyu said.</p><p>\u201cI think that would be an excellent idea,\u201d Iida said. \u201cIt would be a terrific bonding experience for all of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019d get to eat more fried chicken,\u201d Todoroki said bluntly.</p><p>Iida nodded. \u201cThat as well.\u201d</p><p>And so, the five friends left the restaurant with smiles on their faces, looking forward to the days ahead.</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>I hope you liked it Fran!</p>",

I don\u2019t want you up all night on Sunday trying to finish it.\u201d Before the students could say a word, Aizawa walked out the door.</p><p>After their teacher left, Izuku pulled out his phone and brought up a specific webpage, a huge smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cMidoriya, are you ready to go?\u201d a voice asked.</p><p>Izuku looked up to see Iida and Uraraka standing over his desk.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we don\u2019t want to miss the train, Deku,\u201d Uraraka said anxiously.</p><p>\u201cOh, actually, I wasn\u2019t going to head straight home today,\u201d Izuku said as he put away his phone. \u201cYou guys can head to the train stations without me.\u201d His friends looked at Izuku quizzically but said nothing.</p><p>\u201cIf you say so, Uraraka and I will head out,\u201d Iida said and then turned around.</p><p>Uraraka gave a wave and started walking towards the door with Iida.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Izuku said, stopping his friends in their tracks. They turned around and saw Izuku with a slight blush on his face. \u201cActually, would you guys like to go with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, go where?\u201d Uraraka asked.</p><p>Izuku rubbed the back of his head. \u201cIt\u2019s this new restaurant I want to try, I read about it online, and I was planning on going today. You don\u2019t have to come; I just thought I\u2019d ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I want to come, Deku,\u201d Uraraka said with a smile. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m starving after Hero training; I could use a bite to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like a wonderful idea,\u201d Iida said. \u201cI just need to contact my mother and tell her I\u2019ll be getting home later than normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome!\u201d Izuku exclaimed. He grabbed his bag and stood up. \u201cI\u2019m really excited to go; I\u2019m so glad you can come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, where are we going?\u201d A cool voice asked.</p><p>The three friends turned their heads to see Todoroki standing a few feet away.</p><p>\u201cUh\u2026what?\u201d Uraraka said.</p><p>\u201cYou said you were all going out to get food and I want to come with you,\u201d Todoroki said bluntly.</p><p>\u201cUm, sure, you can come, Todoroki,\u201d Izuku said. \u201cThe more, the merrier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it be alright if I came too, ribbit?\u201d a new voice said.</p><p>The four turned to Tsuyu standing a couple of feet away, a curious look on her face.</p><p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s fine,\u201d Izuku said. \u201cAny reason why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just hungry, and food always tastes better when you\u2019re with friends, ribbit,\u201d Tsuyu said.</p><p>\u201cAlright then,\u201d Izuku exclaimed. \u201cLet\u2019s get going!\u201d</p><p>As the five teens walked out of the school, a thought occurred to Todoroki. \u201cIida, where exactly are we going?\u201d</p><p>The blue haired teen rubbed his chin and thought. \u201cNow that you mention it, I don\u2019t know. We forgot to ask Midoriya what this restaurant is.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here!\u201d Izuku shouted, practically vibrating with excitement.</p><p>Uraraka, Iida, Todoroki, and Tsuyu stood behind their friend giving him odd looks. The five UA students found themselves in front of a fast food restaurant with a bright exterior and a sign that said \u2018Jollibee\u2019 in chubby white lettering. Next to the door was a statue of a cartoon styled red bee wearing a vest, gloves, yellows shoes, and a chef\u2019s hat.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this place?\u201d Todoroki asked.</p><p>\u201cHow do you say that?\u201d Uraraka said. \u201cJole-ib-ee, Jalw-eeb-eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pronounced Jolly-Bee, you know, like a jolly bee,\u201d Izuku explained. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go in.\u201d He opened the doors and walked in, his friends right behind him. The interior had bright red and yellow walls, red chairs, and white tables. White counters lined the floor to ceiling window wall with yellow stools to sit on.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we waiting for, let\u2019s order our food,\u201d Izuku said before practically sprinting to the register.</p><p>\u201cHey, Deku, wait for us,\u201d Uraraka said. She, Todoroki, and Tsuyu followed after the green haired boy.</p><p>Iida was about to do the same, but then he noticed something. He stopped and looked around the restaurant, it was packed, and almost every seat was taken. And almost every customer appeared to be Filipino. In fact, he and his friends appeared to be the only Japanese people in the establishment.</p><p>\u2018Strange,\u2019 Iida thought. Before he could further contemplate this, he noticed Uraraka waving him over so they could place their orders.</p><p>\u201cOh man, it all looks so good,\u201d Izuku said, practically drooling as he looked over the menu. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m gonna get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you mean,\u201d Uraraka said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if I want a burger or chicken or-\u201d She cut herself off, her eyes wide with shock. \u201cDeku, look!\u201d She exclaimed grabbing Izuku by the shoulder. \u201cThey have red been pies! We have to get those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s new,\u201d Izuku said.</p><p>Iida raised an eyebrow at his statement. \u2018New? This restaurant just opened.\u2019 He shook his head and decided to save his questions for later.</p><p>\u201cYou can order whatever you desire; I\u2019ll gladly pay,\u201d Iida.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Tsuyu said. \u201cEven if it is fast food, that\u2019ll still be a lot of money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, allow me to pay. I don\u2019t want you all fretting about the price; this is supposed to be a nice day out.\u201d Iida smiled. \u201cBesides, as Midoriya and Uraraka have stated before, I\u2019m a \u2018rich kid\u2019 so it\u2019s honestly no trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome!\u201d \u00a0Izuku and Uraraka exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Iida,\u201d Tsuyu said.</p><p>\u201cThank, you,\u201d Todoroki said.</p><p>They turned to the cashier, whom Iida noticed was also Filipino. She smiled at the group and said \u201cHello, welcome to Jollibee. What can we get for you today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi there, I\u2019d like an Aloha Burger with garlic fries and a large drink, please,\u201d Izuku said. \u201cOh, and a Halo-Halo for dessert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I get the Fiesta Noodles with a drink, and a red been pie,\u201d Uraraka said.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll just get the hotdog and a drink,\u201d Todoroki said.</p><p>Tsuyu hummed to herself for a moment as she looked over the menu. \u201cI\u2019ll get the spaghetti with a side of corn and a medium drink. I\u2019d also like an Ube Pearl Cooler, ribbit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat all sounds excellent,\u201d Iida said before turning to the cashier. \u201cI would like the Burger Steak with rice and a drink please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright, will that be all for you kids today?\u201d the cashier said.</p><p>\u201cOh, Iida,\u201d Izuku exclaimed. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get any fried chicken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeg pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJollibee\u2019s fried chicken is amazing; we can\u2019t just come here and not get any. We should get a bucket to share.\u201d</p><p>Iida raised an eyebrow at his friend\u2019s statement. \u2018How does he know that?\u2019</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to try the chicken,\u201d Uraraka said, licking her lips. \u201cShould we get the regular or spicy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like spicy food, ribbit,\u201d Tsuyu said. \u201cCan we get the regular?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut their spicy chicken is amazing,\u201d Izuku said.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we just get both?\u201d Todoroki said. \u201cThat way everyone\u2019s happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Iida said contemplatively. \u201cNormally I\u2019d be against such excessive eating and spending.\u201d After a moment he smiled. \u201cBut since today is a special day I\u2019ll allow.\u201d He turned back to the cashier. \u201cWe\u2019d also like two buckets of chicken, one regular and one spicy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent, you total today comes to 7,106 Yen,\u201d the cashier said. Iida handed her his debit card, and she then reached over and grabbed a buzzer and handed it to Iida along with the card. \u201cYour food will be ready shortly. Have a jolly day.\u201d</p><p>After some searching, the five friends found a table and sat down to wait for their order. \u201cI\u2019m so excited,\u201d Izuku said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I want to eat more, the fried chicken or the burger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Deku,\u201d Uraraka said. \u201cWhat exactly is an Aloha Burger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s awesome!\u201d Izuku exclaimed, his eyes practically sparkling. \u201cIt\u2019s a burger with lettuce, tomato, cheese, honey mustard, lots of bacon, and a slice of grilled pineapple.\u201d He licked his lips as he envisioned the burger in his mind.</p><p>\u201cWow that does sound good,\u201d Uraraka said. \u201cI kind of wish I ordered that instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll love the Fiesta Noodles,\u201d Izuku said. \u201cEverything here is awesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, Midoriya,\u201d Iida said. \u201cBut may I ask you a question?\u201d</p><p>Izuku looked up at his friend and blinked in surprise. \u201cUh, sure. What is it, Iida?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, even though this restaurant just opened, you already appear to be very familiar with it, I\u2019m curious as to how?\u201d Iida asked. Izuku\u2019s body went stiff.</p><p>\u201cNow that I think about it, you seemed to really know your way around the menu when you ordered your food,\u201d Tsuyu said, placing her pointer finger on her chin.</p><p>\u201cAnd you were raving about their fried chicken even though this is your first time here,\u201d Todoroki.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah,\u201d Uraraka exclaimed. \u201cAnd you said that the Anko Pie was new, but this place only just opened.\u201d</p><p>Izuku let out a nervous laugh as he rubbed the back of his head. \u201cWell, the thing is, this isn\u2019t my first time at a Jollibee.\u201d</p><p>His four friends looked at him in confusion, wondering what exactly he was talking about.</p><p>\u201cYou see, Jollibee isn\u2019t just this place, it\u2019s a really popular chain of restaurants,\u201d Izuku said.</p><p>\u201cIf they\u2019re so popular, how come I\u2019ve never heard of them?\u201d Todoroki asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because this is their first Japanese location,\u201d Izuku explained. \u201cJollibee is actually a Filipino fast food chain, and they\u2019re really popular over there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I see,\u201d Todoroki said as he looked around. \u201cThat explains why all the staff and customers are Filipino.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d Uraraka said. \u201cIf it\u2019s a Filipino chain, then why do you know about it, Deku?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhm, I\u2019ve been to the Philippines before. A lot of times,\u201d Izuku said.</p><p>\u201cOh, your family likes to vacation in the Philippines?\u201d Iida asked.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d Izuku said. \u201cI\u2019m actually half-Filipino on my dad\u2019s side, so I\u2019ve got a lot of family over there.\u201d</p><p>His friends stared at him for a moment, their eyes wide as they tried to process what they\u2019d just heard.</p><p>\u201cWait, what,\u201d Uraraka said. \u201cYou are. How come you never said anything before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know; it just didn\u2019t seem important,\u201d Izuku said.</p><p>\u201cHold on, I think I remember you told us your dad\u2019s name was Hisashi,\u201d Tsuyu said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like a Filipino name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not actually,\u201d Izuku said. \u201cBut there\u2019s a reason. You see, my lola and lolo moved to Japan after they got married, and when they had my dad, they decided to give him a Japanese name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, Deku, what\u2019s a lola?\u201d Uraraka asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, lola and lolo is Filipino for grandma and grandpa,\u201d Izuku explained. \u201cThat\u2019s what I call them, and I call my mom\u2019s parent grandma and grandpa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they live close by?\u201d Tsuyu asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Izuku said. \u201cLola and lolo moved back to the Philippines after they retired, and that was when I was pretty young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, have you been to the Philippines a lot?\u201d Iida asked.</p><p>\u201cLoads of times. Every time we visit my mom and I stop at the Jollibee\u2019s at the airport, the manager even knows me by name.\u201d Izuku smiled as he recalled the memory.</p><p>\u201cCan you speak Filipinese?\u201d Uraraka asked.</p><p>Izuku laughed. \u201cThe language is called Filipino, and yes, I can. I\u2019m bilingual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoah, that\u2019s so cool,\u201d Uraraka said. \u201cI wish I could speak two languages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh that\u2019s nothing, you should see my lola,\u201d Izuku said. \u201cShe can speak five languages; Filipino, English, Spanish, Japanese, and Malay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemarkable,\u201d Iida said. \u201cTo be able to speak such a multitude of languages is an incredible achievement. Your lola sound like a wonderful person.\u201d</p><p>Izuku blushed.</p><p>\u201cMidoriya,\u201d Todoroki said, catching the green haired boy\u2019s attention. \u201cDid you not tell us about this because you were afraid?\u201d</p><p>The table went dead silent at Todoroki\u2019s question. Iida, Uraraka, and Tsuyu gaped at the bicolored teen in disbelief. Izuku, on the other hand, went completely rigged.</p><p>\u201cTodoroki!\u201d Iida yelled. \u201cThat kind of question is highly inappropriate. You should apologize to Midoriya at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIida, wait,\u201d Izuku said, holding up his hands in a placating motion. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, Todoroki\u2019s always been pretty blunt, and it\u2019s an honest question.\u201d He sighed. \u201cAnd to be honest, yeah. I\u2019ve always been a little apprehensive about telling people I\u2019m biracial. When I told my kindergarten class I was half-Filipino I got teased a lot for it and went on until elementary school. It stopped when I got to middle school, but I was afraid it might happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Deku,\u201d Uraraka said as she reached over to grip Izuku\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry that happened to you. I can\u2019t they would say stuff like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople can be jerks,\u201d Tsuyu said with a small scowl. \u201cI bet they didn\u2019t even try to get to know the real you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour former classmates\u2019 behavior was absolutely deplorable,\u201d Iida proclaimed. \u201cNo one should ever be belittled because of their heritage.\u201d</p><p>Todoroki nodded at Iida\u2019s statement. \u201cIf anyone tries that again just let me know.\u201d</p><p>Izuku stared at his friends in stunned silence, overwhelmed by their kind words. \u201cOh, you guys,\u201d Izuku said with a massive smile on his face. \u201cThank you all so much. No one\u2019s ever said that to me before; you\u2019re the greatest friends anyone could ask for.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, their buzzer started vibrating and flashing red. \u201cOh, that\u2019s our food,\u201d Iida said and got up. A minute later he came back with a tray piled high with a mountain.</p><p>\u201cWow this looks awesome,\u201d Uraraka said as she opened the box containing her Fiesta Noodles. \u201cAnd look at these tiny little shrimp, they\u2019re almost too cute to eat. Almost.\u201d</p><p>Todoroki eyed his hotdog suspiciously. \u201cWhy does my hotdog have cheese on it, and what\u2019s with the mustard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not mustard, it\u2019s cheese sauce,\u201d Izuku explained.</p><p>\u201cJust give it a try, Todoroki,\u201d Tsuyu said. \u201cThis spaghetti\u2019s got sliced up hotdog and ham in it, but I\u2019m willing to try it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright everyone, let\u2019s dig in,\u201d Iida said.</p><p>\u201cThank you for the meal!\u201d they said together before digging in.</p><p>\u201cOh my gosh, this tastes so good,\u201d Uraraka said with a look of bliss on her face. \u201cThis sauce is awesome!\u201d She happily slurped up another forkful of noodles with a smile.</p><p>Tsuyu speared of a piece of hotdog with her forkful spaghetti and brought it to her mouth. \u201cHuh, that\u2019s weird,\u201d she said with an unreadable expression. \u201cThis spaghetti tastes kind of sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the banana ketchup,\u201d Izuku explained after swallowing a bite of his burger. \u201cIt\u2019s a sauce made from mashed bananas and spices; people like to mix it with the marinara sauce in the Philippines. Filipino style spaghetti is kind of an acquired taste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I like, ribbit,\u201d Tsuyu said cheerfully. \u201cIt\u2019s different from the pasta I make for younger siblings; maybe I\u2019ll bring them some, ribbit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I am quite enjoying this burger steak,\u201d Iida said. \u201cThe gravy is delectable, and the meat is very tender.\u201d He scooped some rice and a bite of burger into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really glad you\u2019re all enjoying it,\u201d Izuku said. \u201cWhat about you, Todoroki, do you like the hotdog?\u201d</p><p>The bicolored teen was currently chewing on a piece of said hotdog and simply shrugged before swallowing. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t dislike it, but I wouldn\u2019t order it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh well, guess they can\u2019t all be winners,\u201d Izuku said with a sigh. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you try the chicken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Todoroki said, putting down his hotdog. He reached over and grabbed a piece of regular chicken and brought it to his mouth. He took a small bite and chewed slowly. Suddenly, his eyes lit up, and he started devouring the fried chicken in his hand. He licked his lips and said \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d before reaching over for another.</p><p>\u201cTodoroki, make sure you leave some for the rest of us,\u201d Tsuyu said with a pout.</p><p>Todoroki made an indiscernible noise with his mouth full of food.</p><p>Izuku let out a small laugh. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you try the spicy chicken next, Todoroki, so Tsuyu can try some?\u201d</p><p>As the afternoon went on, not a single scrap of food remained on their table, save for Todoroki\u2019s half-eaten hotdog. The five friends sat contently around their table, stuffed to burst with Jollibee\u2019s food.</p><p>\u201cOh man, those noodles were amazing,\u201d Uraraka said as she patted her stomach. \u201cAnd that red been pie was so good, I want to eat another, but I\u2019m too full.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re full, look at me,\u201d Izuku said. \u201cI barely managed to finish my Hola-Hola, I don\u2019t think I have enough room for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay, Midoriya, what is a Hola-Hola?\u201d Tsuyu asked. \u201cIt looked really good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s shaved ice and evaporated milk layered with sweet gelatin and fruit topped off with ice cream and a piece of flan,\u201d Izuku explained contently. \u201cIt\u2019s the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s sound delicious,\u201d Tsuyu said. \u201cI\u2019d love to try it, ribbit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on, I think we\u2019ve had more than enough to eat today,\u201d Iida said sternly. \u201cAs heroes in training, we shouldn\u2019t gorge ourselves on fast food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we could always just come back here next week,\u201d Todoroki said. \u201cI\u2019d like to try the noodles Uraraka got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a great idea,\u201d Uraraka exclaimed. \u201cHow about we do this every week, every Friday after school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds awesome,\u201d Izuku replied.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that, ribbit,\u201d Tsuyu said.</p><p>\u201cI think that would be an excellent idea,\u201d Iida said. \u201cIt would be a terrific bonding experience for all of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019d get to eat more fried chicken,\u201d Todoroki said bluntly.</p><p>Iida nodded. \u201cThat as well.\u201d</p><p>And so, the five friends left the restaurant with smiles on their faces, looking forward to the days ahead.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>I hope you liked it Fran!</p>",

I don\u2019t want you up all night on Sunday trying to finish it.\u201d Before the students could say a word, Aizawa walked out the door.</p><p>After their teacher left, Izuku pulled out his phone and brought up a specific webpage, a huge smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cMidoriya, are you ready to go?\u201d a voice asked.</p><p>Izuku looked up to see Iida and Uraraka standing over his desk.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we don\u2019t want to miss the train, Deku,\u201d Uraraka said anxiously.</p><p>\u201cOh, actually, I wasn\u2019t going to head straight home today,\u201d Izuku said as he put away his phone. \u201cYou guys can head to the train stations without me.\u201d His friends looked at Izuku quizzically but said nothing.</p><p>\u201cIf you say so, Uraraka and I will head out,\u201d Iida said and then turned around.</p><p>Uraraka gave a wave and started walking towards the door with Iida.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Izuku said, stopping his friends in their tracks. They turned around and saw Izuku with a slight blush on his face. \u201cActually, would you guys like to go with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, go where?\u201d Uraraka asked.</p><p>Izuku rubbed the back of his head. \u201cIt\u2019s this new restaurant I want to try, I read about it online, and I was planning on going today. You don\u2019t have to come; I just thought I\u2019d ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I want to come, Deku,\u201d Uraraka said with a smile. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m starving after Hero training; I could use a bite to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like a wonderful idea,\u201d Iida said. \u201cI just need to contact my mother and tell her I\u2019ll be getting home later than normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome!\u201d Izuku exclaimed. He grabbed his bag and stood up. \u201cI\u2019m really excited to go; I\u2019m so glad you can come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, where are we going?\u201d A cool voice asked.</p><p>The three friends turned their heads to see Todoroki standing a few feet away.</p><p>\u201cUh\u2026what?\u201d Uraraka said.</p><p>\u201cYou said you were all going out to get food and I want to come with you,\u201d Todoroki said bluntly.</p><p>\u201cUm, sure, you can come, Todoroki,\u201d Izuku said. \u201cThe more, the merrier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it be alright if I came too, ribbit?\u201d a new voice said.</p><p>The four turned to Tsuyu standing a couple of feet away, a curious look on her face.</p><p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s fine,\u201d Izuku said. \u201cAny reason why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just hungry, and food always tastes better when you\u2019re with friends, ribbit,\u201d Tsuyu said.</p><p>\u201cAlright then,\u201d Izuku exclaimed. \u201cLet\u2019s get going!\u201d</p><p>As the five teens walked out of the school, a thought occurred to Todoroki. \u201cIida, where exactly are we going?\u201d</p><p>The blue haired teen rubbed his chin and thought. \u201cNow that you mention it, I don\u2019t know. We forgot to ask Midoriya what this restaurant is.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here!\u201d Izuku shouted, practically vibrating with excitement.</p><p>Uraraka, Iida, Todoroki, and Tsuyu stood behind their friend giving him odd looks. The five UA students found themselves in front of a fast food restaurant with a bright exterior and a sign that said \u2018Jollibee\u2019 in chubby white lettering. Next to the door was a statue of a cartoon styled red bee wearing a vest, gloves, yellows shoes, and a chef\u2019s hat.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this place?\u201d Todoroki asked.</p><p>\u201cHow do you say that?\u201d Uraraka said. \u201cJole-ib-ee, Jalw-eeb-eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pronounced Jolly-Bee, you know, like a jolly bee,\u201d Izuku explained. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go in.\u201d He opened the doors and walked in, his friends right behind him. The interior had bright red and yellow walls, red chairs, and white tables. White counters lined the floor to ceiling window wall with yellow stools to sit on.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we waiting for, let\u2019s order our food,\u201d Izuku said before practically sprinting to the register.</p><p>\u201cHey, Deku, wait for us,\u201d Uraraka said. She, Todoroki, and Tsuyu followed after the green haired boy.</p><p>Iida was about to do the same, but then he noticed something. He stopped and looked around the restaurant, it was packed, and almost every seat was taken. And almost every customer appeared to be Filipino. In fact, he and his friends appeared to be the only Japanese people in the establishment.</p><p>\u2018Strange,\u2019 Iida thought. Before he could further contemplate this, he noticed Uraraka waving him over so they could place their orders.</p><p>\u201cOh man, it all looks so good,\u201d Izuku said, practically drooling as he looked over the menu. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m gonna get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you mean,\u201d Uraraka said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if I want a burger or chicken or-\u201d She cut herself off, her eyes wide with shock. \u201cDeku, look!\u201d She exclaimed grabbing Izuku by the shoulder. \u201cThey have red been pies! We have to get those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s new,\u201d Izuku said.</p><p>Iida raised an eyebrow at his statement. \u2018New? This restaurant just opened.\u2019 He shook his head and decided to save his questions for later.</p><p>\u201cYou can order whatever you desire; I\u2019ll gladly pay,\u201d Iida.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Tsuyu said. \u201cEven if it is fast food, that\u2019ll still be a lot of money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, allow me to pay. I don\u2019t want you all fretting about the price; this is supposed to be a nice day out.\u201d Iida smiled. \u201cBesides, as Midoriya and Uraraka have stated before, I\u2019m a \u2018rich kid\u2019 so it\u2019s honestly no trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome!\u201d \u00a0Izuku and Uraraka exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Iida,\u201d Tsuyu said.</p><p>\u201cThank, you,\u201d Todoroki said.</p><p>They turned to the cashier, whom Iida noticed was also Filipino. She smiled at the group and said \u201cHello, welcome to Jollibee. What can we get for you today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi there, I\u2019d like an Aloha Burger with garlic fries and a large drink, please,\u201d Izuku said. \u201cOh, and a Halo-Halo for dessert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I get the Fiesta Noodles with a drink, and a red been pie,\u201d Uraraka said.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll just get the hotdog and a drink,\u201d Todoroki said.</p><p>Tsuyu hummed to herself for a moment as she looked over the menu. \u201cI\u2019ll get the spaghetti with a side of corn and a medium drink. I\u2019d also like an Ube Pearl Cooler, ribbit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat all sounds excellent,\u201d Iida said before turning to the cashier. \u201cI would like the Burger Steak with rice and a drink please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright, will that be all for you kids today?\u201d the cashier said.</p><p>\u201cOh, Iida,\u201d Izuku exclaimed. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get any fried chicken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeg pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJollibee\u2019s fried chicken is amazing; we can\u2019t just come here and not get any. We should get a bucket to share.\u201d</p><p>Iida raised an eyebrow at his friend\u2019s statement. \u2018How does he know that?\u2019</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to try the chicken,\u201d Uraraka said, licking her lips. \u201cShould we get the regular or spicy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like spicy food, ribbit,\u201d Tsuyu said. \u201cCan we get the regular?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut their spicy chicken is amazing,\u201d Izuku said.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we just get both?\u201d Todoroki said. \u201cThat way everyone\u2019s happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Iida said contemplatively. \u201cNormally I\u2019d be against such excessive eating and spending.\u201d After a moment he smiled. \u201cBut since today is a special day I\u2019ll allow.\u201d He turned back to the cashier. \u201cWe\u2019d also like two buckets of chicken, one regular and one spicy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent, you total today comes to 7,106 Yen,\u201d the cashier said. Iida handed her his debit card, and she then reached over and grabbed a buzzer and handed it to Iida along with the card. \u201cYour food will be ready shortly. Have a jolly day.\u201d</p><p>After some searching, the five friends found a table and sat down to wait for their order. \u201cI\u2019m so excited,\u201d Izuku said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I want to eat more, the fried chicken or the burger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Deku,\u201d Uraraka said. \u201cWhat exactly is an Aloha Burger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s awesome!\u201d Izuku exclaimed, his eyes practically sparkling. \u201cIt\u2019s a burger with lettuce, tomato, cheese, honey mustard, lots of bacon, and a slice of grilled pineapple.\u201d He licked his lips as he envisioned the burger in his mind.</p><p>\u201cWow that does sound good,\u201d Uraraka said. \u201cI kind of wish I ordered that instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll love the Fiesta Noodles,\u201d Izuku said. \u201cEverything here is awesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, Midoriya,\u201d Iida said. \u201cBut may I ask you a question?\u201d</p><p>Izuku looked up at his friend and blinked in surprise. \u201cUh, sure. What is it, Iida?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, even though this restaurant just opened, you already appear to be very familiar with it, I\u2019m curious as to how?\u201d Iida asked. Izuku\u2019s body went stiff.</p><p>\u201cNow that I think about it, you seemed to really know your way around the menu when you ordered your food,\u201d Tsuyu said, placing her pointer finger on her chin.</p><p>\u201cAnd you were raving about their fried chicken even though this is your first time here,\u201d Todoroki.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah,\u201d Uraraka exclaimed. \u201cAnd you said that the Anko Pie was new, but this place only just opened.\u201d</p><p>Izuku let out a nervous laugh as he rubbed the back of his head. \u201cWell, the thing is, this isn\u2019t my first time at a Jollibee.\u201d</p><p>His four friends looked at him in confusion, wondering what exactly he was talking about.</p><p>\u201cYou see, Jollibee isn\u2019t just this place, it\u2019s a really popular chain of restaurants,\u201d Izuku said.</p><p>\u201cIf they\u2019re so popular, how come I\u2019ve never heard of them?\u201d Todoroki asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because this is their first Japanese location,\u201d Izuku explained. \u201cJollibee is actually a Filipino fast food chain, and they\u2019re really popular over there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I see,\u201d Todoroki said as he looked around. \u201cThat explains why all the staff and customers are Filipino.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d Uraraka said. \u201cIf it\u2019s a Filipino chain, then why do you know about it, Deku?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhm, I\u2019ve been to the Philippines before. A lot of times,\u201d Izuku said.</p><p>\u201cOh, your family likes to vacation in the Philippines?\u201d Iida asked.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d Izuku said. \u201cI\u2019m actually half-Filipino on my dad\u2019s side, so I\u2019ve got a lot of family over there.\u201d</p><p>His friends stared at him for a moment, their eyes wide as they tried to process what they\u2019d just heard.</p><p>\u201cWait, what,\u201d Uraraka said. \u201cYou are. How come you never said anything before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know; it just didn\u2019t seem important,\u201d Izuku said.</p><p>\u201cHold on, I think I remember you told us your dad\u2019s name was Hisashi,\u201d Tsuyu said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like a Filipino name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not actually,\u201d Izuku said. \u201cBut there\u2019s a reason. You see, my lola and lolo moved to Japan after they got married, and when they had my dad, they decided to give him a Japanese name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, Deku, what\u2019s a lola?\u201d Uraraka asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, lola and lolo is Filipino for grandma and grandpa,\u201d Izuku explained. \u201cThat\u2019s what I call them, and I call my mom\u2019s parent grandma and grandpa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they live close by?\u201d Tsuyu asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Izuku said. \u201cLola and lolo moved back to the Philippines after they retired, and that was when I was pretty young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, have you been to the Philippines a lot?\u201d Iida asked.</p><p>\u201cLoads of times. Every time we visit my mom and I stop at the Jollibee\u2019s at the airport, the manager even knows me by name.\u201d Izuku smiled as he recalled the memory.</p><p>\u201cCan you speak Filipinese?\u201d Uraraka asked.</p><p>Izuku laughed. \u201cThe language is called Filipino, and yes, I can. I\u2019m bilingual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoah, that\u2019s so cool,\u201d Uraraka said. \u201cI wish I could speak two languages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh that\u2019s nothing, you should see my lola,\u201d Izuku said. \u201cShe can speak five languages; Filipino, English, Spanish, Japanese, and Malay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemarkable,\u201d Iida said. \u201cTo be able to speak such a multitude of languages is an incredible achievement. Your lola sound like a wonderful person.\u201d</p><p>Izuku blushed.</p><p>\u201cMidoriya,\u201d Todoroki said, catching the green haired boy\u2019s attention. \u201cDid you not tell us about this because you were afraid?\u201d</p><p>The table went dead silent at Todoroki\u2019s question. Iida, Uraraka, and Tsuyu gaped at the bicolored teen in disbelief. Izuku, on the other hand, went completely rigged.</p><p>\u201cTodoroki!\u201d Iida yelled. \u201cThat kind of question is highly inappropriate. You should apologize to Midoriya at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIida, wait,\u201d Izuku said, holding up his hands in a placating motion. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, Todoroki\u2019s always been pretty blunt, and it\u2019s an honest question.\u201d He sighed. \u201cAnd to be honest, yeah. I\u2019ve always been a little apprehensive about telling people I\u2019m biracial. When I told my kindergarten class I was half-Filipino I got teased a lot for it and went on until elementary school. It stopped when I got to middle school, but I was afraid it might happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Deku,\u201d Uraraka said as she reached over to grip Izuku\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry that happened to you. I can\u2019t they would say stuff like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople can be jerks,\u201d Tsuyu said with a small scowl. \u201cI bet they didn\u2019t even try to get to know the real you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour former classmates\u2019 behavior was absolutely deplorable,\u201d Iida proclaimed. \u201cNo one should ever be belittled because of their heritage.\u201d</p><p>Todoroki nodded at Iida\u2019s statement. \u201cIf anyone tries that again just let me know.\u201d</p><p>Izuku stared at his friends in stunned silence, overwhelmed by their kind words. \u201cOh, you guys,\u201d Izuku said with a massive smile on his face. \u201cThank you all so much. No one\u2019s ever said that to me before; you\u2019re the greatest friends anyone could ask for.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, their buzzer started vibrating and flashing red. \u201cOh, that\u2019s our food,\u201d Iida said and got up. A minute later he came back with a tray piled high with a mountain.</p><p>\u201cWow this looks awesome,\u201d Uraraka said as she opened the box containing her Fiesta Noodles. \u201cAnd look at these tiny little shrimp, they\u2019re almost too cute to eat. Almost.\u201d</p><p>Todoroki eyed his hotdog suspiciously. \u201cWhy does my hotdog have cheese on it, and what\u2019s with the mustard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not mustard, it\u2019s cheese sauce,\u201d Izuku explained.</p><p>\u201cJust give it a try, Todoroki,\u201d Tsuyu said. \u201cThis spaghetti\u2019s got sliced up hotdog and ham in it, but I\u2019m willing to try it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright everyone, let\u2019s dig in,\u201d Iida said.</p><p>\u201cThank you for the meal!\u201d they said together before digging in.</p><p>\u201cOh my gosh, this tastes so good,\u201d Uraraka said with a look of bliss on her face. \u201cThis sauce is awesome!\u201d She happily slurped up another forkful of noodles with a smile.</p><p>Tsuyu speared of a piece of hotdog with her forkful spaghetti and brought it to her mouth. \u201cHuh, that\u2019s weird,\u201d she said with an unreadable expression. \u201cThis spaghetti tastes kind of sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the banana ketchup,\u201d Izuku explained after swallowing a bite of his burger. \u201cIt\u2019s a sauce made from mashed bananas and spices; people like to mix it with the marinara sauce in the Philippines. Filipino style spaghetti is kind of an acquired taste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I like, ribbit,\u201d Tsuyu said cheerfully. \u201cIt\u2019s different from the pasta I make for younger siblings; maybe I\u2019ll bring them some, ribbit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I am quite enjoying this burger steak,\u201d Iida said. \u201cThe gravy is delectable, and the meat is very tender.\u201d He scooped some rice and a bite of burger into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really glad you\u2019re all enjoying it,\u201d Izuku said. \u201cWhat about you, Todoroki, do you like the hotdog?\u201d</p><p>The bicolored teen was currently chewing on a piece of said hotdog and simply shrugged before swallowing. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t dislike it, but I wouldn\u2019t order it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh well, guess they can\u2019t all be winners,\u201d Izuku said with a sigh. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you try the chicken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Todoroki said, putting down his hotdog. He reached over and grabbed a piece of regular chicken and brought it to his mouth. He took a small bite and chewed slowly. Suddenly, his eyes lit up, and he started devouring the fried chicken in his hand. He licked his lips and said \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d before reaching over for another.</p><p>\u201cTodoroki, make sure you leave some for the rest of us,\u201d Tsuyu said with a pout.</p><p>Todoroki made an indiscernible noise with his mouth full of food.</p><p>Izuku let out a small laugh. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you try the spicy chicken next, Todoroki, so Tsuyu can try some?\u201d</p><p>As the afternoon went on, not a single scrap of food remained on their table, save for Todoroki\u2019s half-eaten hotdog. The five friends sat contently around their table, stuffed to burst with Jollibee\u2019s food.</p><p>\u201cOh man, those noodles were amazing,\u201d Uraraka said as she patted her stomach. \u201cAnd that red been pie was so good, I want to eat another, but I\u2019m too full.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re full, look at me,\u201d Izuku said. \u201cI barely managed to finish my Hola-Hola, I don\u2019t think I have enough room for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay, Midoriya, what is a Hola-Hola?\u201d Tsuyu asked. \u201cIt looked really good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s shaved ice and evaporated milk layered with sweet gelatin and fruit topped off with ice cream and a piece of flan,\u201d Izuku explained contently. \u201cIt\u2019s the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s sound delicious,\u201d Tsuyu said. \u201cI\u2019d love to try it, ribbit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on, I think we\u2019ve had more than enough to eat today,\u201d Iida said sternly. \u201cAs heroes in training, we shouldn\u2019t gorge ourselves on fast food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we could always just come back here next week,\u201d Todoroki said. \u201cI\u2019d like to try the noodles Uraraka got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a great idea,\u201d Uraraka exclaimed. \u201cHow about we do this every week, every Friday after school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds awesome,\u201d Izuku replied.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that, ribbit,\u201d Tsuyu said.</p><p>\u201cI think that would be an excellent idea,\u201d Iida said. \u201cIt would be a terrific bonding experience for all of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019d get to eat more fried chicken,\u201d Todoroki said bluntly.</p><p>Iida nodded. \u201cThat as well.\u201d</p><p>And so, the five friends left the restaurant with smiles on their faces, looking forward to the days ahead.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>I hope you liked it Fran!</p>",

I don&rsquo;t want you up all night on Sunday trying to finish it.&rdquo; Before the students could say a word, Aizawa walked out the door.</p><p>After their teacher left, Izuku pulled out his phone and brought up a specific webpage, a huge smile on his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Midoriya, are you ready to go?&rdquo; a voice asked.</p><p>Izuku looked up to see Iida and Uraraka standing over his desk.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, we don&rsquo;t want to miss the train, Deku,&rdquo; Uraraka said anxiously.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, actually, I wasn&rsquo;t going to head straight home today,&rdquo; Izuku said as he put away his phone. &ldquo;You guys can head to the train stations without me.&rdquo; His friends looked at Izuku quizzically but said nothing.</p><p>&ldquo;If you say so, Uraraka and I will head out,&rdquo; Iida said and then turned around.</p><p>Uraraka gave a wave and started walking towards the door with Iida.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; Izuku said, stopping his friends in their tracks. They turned around and saw Izuku with a slight blush on his face. &ldquo;Actually, would you guys like to go with me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, go where?&rdquo; Uraraka asked.</p><p>Izuku rubbed the back of his head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s this new restaurant I want to try, I read about it online, and I was planning on going today. You don&rsquo;t have to come; I just thought I&rsquo;d ask.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course I want to come, Deku,&rdquo; Uraraka said with a smile. &ldquo;To be honest, I&rsquo;m starving after Hero training; I could use a bite to eat.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It sounds like a wonderful idea,&rdquo; Iida said. &ldquo;I just need to contact my mother and tell her I&rsquo;ll be getting home later than normal.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Awesome!&rdquo; Izuku exclaimed. He grabbed his bag and stood up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really excited to go; I&rsquo;m so glad you can come with me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So, where are we going?&rdquo; A cool voice asked.</p><p>The three friends turned their heads to see Todoroki standing a few feet away.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh&hellip;what?&rdquo; Uraraka said.</p><p>&ldquo;You said you were all going out to get food and I want to come with you,&rdquo; Todoroki said bluntly.</p><p>&ldquo;Um, sure, you can come, Todoroki,&rdquo; Izuku said. &ldquo;The more, the merrier.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Would it be alright if I came too, ribbit?&rdquo; a new voice said.</p><p>The four turned to Tsuyu standing a couple of feet away, a curious look on her face.</p><p>&ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; Izuku said. &ldquo;Any reason why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just hungry, and food always tastes better when you&rsquo;re with friends, ribbit,&rdquo; Tsuyu said.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright then,&rdquo; Izuku exclaimed. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get going!&rdquo;</p><p>As the five teens walked out of the school, a thought occurred to Todoroki. &ldquo;Iida, where exactly are we going?&rdquo;</p><p>The blue haired teen rubbed his chin and thought. &ldquo;Now that you mention it, I don&rsquo;t know. We forgot to ask Midoriya what this restaurant is.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here!&rdquo; Izuku shouted, practically vibrating with excitement.</p><p>Uraraka, Iida, Todoroki, and Tsuyu stood behind their friend giving him odd looks. The five UA students found themselves in front of a fast food restaurant with a bright exterior and a sign that said &lsquo;Jollibee&rsquo; in chubby white lettering. Next to the door was a statue of a cartoon styled red bee wearing a vest, gloves, yellows shoes, and a chef&rsquo;s hat.</p><p>&ldquo;What is this place?&rdquo; Todoroki asked.</p><p>&ldquo;How do you say that?&rdquo; Uraraka said. &ldquo;Jole-ib-ee, Jalw-eeb-eh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s pronounced Jolly-Bee, you know, like a jolly bee,&rdquo; Izuku explained. &ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s go in.&rdquo; He opened the doors and walked in, his friends right behind him. The interior had bright red and yellow walls, red chairs, and white tables. White counters lined the floor to ceiling window wall with yellow stools to sit on.</p><p>&ldquo;What are we waiting for, let&rsquo;s order our food,&rdquo; Izuku said before practically sprinting to the register.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Deku, wait for us,&rdquo; Uraraka said. She, Todoroki, and Tsuyu followed after the green haired boy.</p><p>Iida was about to do the same, but then he noticed something. He stopped and looked around the restaurant, it was packed, and almost every seat was taken. And almost every customer appeared to be Filipino. In fact, he and his friends appeared to be the only Japanese people in the establishment.</p><p>&lsquo;Strange,&rsquo; Iida thought. Before he could further contemplate this, he noticed Uraraka waving him over so they could place their orders.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh man, it all looks so good,&rdquo; Izuku said, practically drooling as he looked over the menu. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m gonna get.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know what you mean,&rdquo; Uraraka said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure if I want a burger or chicken or-&rdquo; She cut herself off, her eyes wide with shock. &ldquo;Deku, look!&rdquo; She exclaimed grabbing Izuku by the shoulder. &ldquo;They have red been pies! We have to get those.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s new,&rdquo; Izuku said.</p><p>Iida raised an eyebrow at his statement. &lsquo;New? This restaurant just opened.&rsquo; He shook his head and decided to save his questions for later.</p><p>&ldquo;You can order whatever you desire; I&rsquo;ll gladly pay,&rdquo; Iida.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; Tsuyu said. &ldquo;Even if it is fast food, that&rsquo;ll still be a lot of money.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please, allow me to pay. I don&rsquo;t want you all fretting about the price; this is supposed to be a nice day out.&rdquo; Iida smiled. &ldquo;Besides, as Midoriya and Uraraka have stated before, I&rsquo;m a &lsquo;rich kid&rsquo; so it&rsquo;s honestly no trouble.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Awesome!&rdquo; &nbsp;Izuku and Uraraka exclaimed.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, Iida,&rdquo; Tsuyu said.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank, you,&rdquo; Todoroki said.</p><p>They turned to the cashier, whom Iida noticed was also Filipino. She smiled at the group and said &ldquo;Hello, welcome to Jollibee. What can we get for you today?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hi there, I&rsquo;d like an Aloha Burger with garlic fries and a large drink, please,&rdquo; Izuku said. &ldquo;Oh, and a Halo-Halo for dessert.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can I get the Fiesta Noodles with a drink, and a red been pie,&rdquo; Uraraka said.</p><p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll just get the hotdog and a drink,&rdquo; Todoroki said.</p><p>Tsuyu hummed to herself for a moment as she looked over the menu. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get the spaghetti with a side of corn and a medium drink. I&rsquo;d also like an Ube Pearl Cooler, ribbit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That all sounds excellent,&rdquo; Iida said before turning to the cashier. &ldquo;I would like the Burger Steak with rice and a drink please.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, will that be all for you kids today?&rdquo; the cashier said.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Iida,&rdquo; Izuku exclaimed. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t get any fried chicken.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Peg pardon?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jollibee&rsquo;s fried chicken is amazing; we can&rsquo;t just come here and not get any. We should get a bucket to share.&rdquo;</p><p>Iida raised an eyebrow at his friend&rsquo;s statement. &lsquo;How does he know that?&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to try the chicken,&rdquo; Uraraka said, licking her lips. &ldquo;Should we get the regular or spicy?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like spicy food, ribbit,&rdquo; Tsuyu said. &ldquo;Can we get the regular?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But their spicy chicken is amazing,&rdquo; Izuku said.</p><p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we just get both?&rdquo; Todoroki said. &ldquo;That way everyone&rsquo;s happy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Iida said contemplatively. &ldquo;Normally I&rsquo;d be against such excessive eating and spending.&rdquo; After a moment he smiled. &ldquo;But since today is a special day I&rsquo;ll allow.&rdquo; He turned back to the cashier. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d also like two buckets of chicken, one regular and one spicy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Excellent, you total today comes to 7,106 Yen,&rdquo; the cashier said. Iida handed her his debit card, and she then reached over and grabbed a buzzer and handed it to Iida along with the card. &ldquo;Your food will be ready shortly. Have a jolly day.&rdquo;</p><p>After some searching, the five friends found a table and sat down to wait for their order. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so excited,&rdquo; Izuku said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I want to eat more, the fried chicken or the burger.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Deku,&rdquo; Uraraka said. &ldquo;What exactly is an Aloha Burger?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s awesome!&rdquo; Izuku exclaimed, his eyes practically sparkling. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a burger with lettuce, tomato, cheese, honey mustard, lots of bacon, and a slice of grilled pineapple.&rdquo; He licked his lips as he envisioned the burger in his mind.</p><p>&ldquo;Wow that does sound good,&rdquo; Uraraka said. &ldquo;I kind of wish I ordered that instead.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll love the Fiesta Noodles,&rdquo; Izuku said. &ldquo;Everything here is awesome.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me, Midoriya,&rdquo; Iida said. &ldquo;But may I ask you a question?&rdquo;</p><p>Izuku looked up at his friend and blinked in surprise. &ldquo;Uh, sure. What is it, Iida?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, even though this restaurant just opened, you already appear to be very familiar with it, I&rsquo;m curious as to how?&rdquo; Iida asked. Izuku&rsquo;s body went stiff.</p><p>&ldquo;Now that I think about it, you seemed to really know your way around the menu when you ordered your food,&rdquo; Tsuyu said, placing her pointer finger on her chin.</p><p>&ldquo;And you were raving about their fried chicken even though this is your first time here,&rdquo; Todoroki.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh yeah,&rdquo; Uraraka exclaimed. &ldquo;And you said that the Anko Pie was new, but this place only just opened.&rdquo;</p><p>Izuku let out a nervous laugh as he rubbed the back of his head. &ldquo;Well, the thing is, this isn&rsquo;t my first time at a Jollibee.&rdquo;</p><p>His four friends looked at him in confusion, wondering what exactly he was talking about.</p><p>&ldquo;You see, Jollibee isn&rsquo;t just this place, it&rsquo;s a really popular chain of restaurants,&rdquo; Izuku said.</p><p>&ldquo;If they&rsquo;re so popular, how come I&rsquo;ve never heard of them?&rdquo; Todoroki asked.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because this is their first Japanese location,&rdquo; Izuku explained. &ldquo;Jollibee is actually a Filipino fast food chain, and they&rsquo;re really popular over there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, I see,&rdquo; Todoroki said as he looked around. &ldquo;That explains why all the staff and customers are Filipino.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; Uraraka said. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s a Filipino chain, then why do you know about it, Deku?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uhm, I&rsquo;ve been to the Philippines before. A lot of times,&rdquo; Izuku said.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, your family likes to vacation in the Philippines?&rdquo; Iida asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; Izuku said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m actually half-Filipino on my dad&rsquo;s side, so I&rsquo;ve got a lot of family over there.&rdquo;</p><p>His friends stared at him for a moment, their eyes wide as they tried to process what they&rsquo;d just heard.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, what,&rdquo; Uraraka said. &ldquo;You are. How come you never said anything before?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; it just didn&rsquo;t seem important,&rdquo; Izuku said.</p><p>&ldquo;Hold on, I think I remember you told us your dad&rsquo;s name was Hisashi,&rdquo; Tsuyu said. &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t sound like a Filipino name.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not actually,&rdquo; Izuku said. &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s a reason. You see, my lola and lolo moved to Japan after they got married, and when they had my dad, they decided to give him a Japanese name.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, Deku, what&rsquo;s a lola?&rdquo; Uraraka asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, lola and lolo is Filipino for grandma and grandpa,&rdquo; Izuku explained. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I call them, and I call my mom&rsquo;s parent grandma and grandpa.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do they live close by?&rdquo; Tsuyu asked.</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Izuku said. &ldquo;Lola and lolo moved back to the Philippines after they retired, and that was when I was pretty young.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So, have you been to the Philippines a lot?&rdquo; Iida asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Loads of times. Every time we visit my mom and I stop at the Jollibee&rsquo;s at the airport, the manager even knows me by name.&rdquo; Izuku smiled as he recalled the memory.</p><p>&ldquo;Can you speak Filipinese?&rdquo; Uraraka asked.</p><p>Izuku laughed. &ldquo;The language is called Filipino, and yes, I can. I&rsquo;m bilingual.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Woah, that&rsquo;s so cool,&rdquo; Uraraka said. &ldquo;I wish I could speak two languages.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh that&rsquo;s nothing, you should see my lola,&rdquo; Izuku said. &ldquo;She can speak five languages; Filipino, English, Spanish, Japanese, and Malay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Remarkable,&rdquo; Iida said. &ldquo;To be able to speak such a multitude of languages is an incredible achievement. Your lola sound like a wonderful person.&rdquo;</p><p>Izuku blushed.</p><p>&ldquo;Midoriya,&rdquo; Todoroki said, catching the green haired boy&rsquo;s attention. &ldquo;Did you not tell us about this because you were afraid?&rdquo;</p><p>The table went dead silent at Todoroki&rsquo;s question. Iida, Uraraka, and Tsuyu gaped at the bicolored teen in disbelief. Izuku, on the other hand, went completely rigged.</p><p>&ldquo;Todoroki!&rdquo; Iida yelled. &ldquo;That kind of question is highly inappropriate.

A minute later he came back with a tray piled high with a mountain.</p><p>&ldquo;Wow this looks awesome,&rdquo; Uraraka said as she opened the box containing her Fiesta Noodles. &ldquo;And look at these tiny little shrimp, they&rsquo;re almost too cute to eat. Almost.&rdquo;</p><p>Todoroki eyed his hotdog suspiciously. &ldquo;Why does my hotdog have cheese on it, and what&rsquo;s with the mustard?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not mustard, it&rsquo;s cheese sauce,&rdquo; Izuku explained.</p><p>&ldquo;Just give it a try, Todoroki,&rdquo; Tsuyu said. &ldquo;This spaghetti&rsquo;s got sliced up hotdog and ham in it, but I&rsquo;m willing to try it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alright everyone, let&rsquo;s dig in,&rdquo; Iida said.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you for the meal!&rdquo; they said together before digging in.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my gosh, this tastes so good,&rdquo; Uraraka said with a look of bliss on her face. &ldquo;This sauce is awesome!&rdquo; She happily slurped up another forkful of noodles with a smile.</p><p>Tsuyu speared of a piece of hotdog with her forkful spaghetti and brought it to her mouth. &ldquo;Huh, that&rsquo;s weird,&rdquo; she said with an unreadable expression. &ldquo;This spaghetti tastes kind of sweet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the banana ketchup,&rdquo; Izuku explained after swallowing a bite of his burger. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sauce made from mashed bananas and spices; people like to mix it with the marinara sauce in the Philippines. Filipino style spaghetti is kind of an acquired taste.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well I like, ribbit,&rdquo; Tsuyu said cheerfully. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s different from the pasta I make for younger siblings; maybe I&rsquo;ll bring them some, ribbit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And I am quite enjoying this burger steak,&rdquo; Iida said. &ldquo;The gravy is delectable, and the meat is very tender.&rdquo; He scooped some rice and a bite of burger into his mouth.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really glad you&rsquo;re all enjoying it,&rdquo; Izuku said. &ldquo;What about you, Todoroki, do you like the hotdog?&rdquo;</p><p>The bicolored teen was currently chewing on a piece of said hotdog and simply shrugged before swallowing. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t dislike it, but I wouldn&rsquo;t order it again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh well, guess they can&rsquo;t all be winners,&rdquo; Izuku said with a sigh. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you try the chicken?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Todoroki said, putting down his hotdog. He reached over and grabbed a piece of regular chicken and brought it to his mouth. He took a small bite and chewed slowly. Suddenly, his eyes lit up, and he started devouring the fried chicken in his hand. He licked his lips and said &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; before reaching over for another.</p><p>&ldquo;Todoroki, make sure you leave some for the rest of us,&rdquo; Tsuyu said with a pout.</p><p>Todoroki made an indiscernible noise with his mouth full of food.</p><p>Izuku let out a small laugh. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you try the spicy chicken next, Todoroki, so Tsuyu can try some?&rdquo;</p><p>As the afternoon went on, not a single scrap of food remained on their table, save for Todoroki&rsquo;s half-eaten hotdog. The five friends sat contently around their table, stuffed to burst with Jollibee&rsquo;s food.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh man, those noodles were amazing,&rdquo; Uraraka said as she patted her stomach. &ldquo;And that red been pie was so good, I want to eat another, but I&rsquo;m too full.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You think you&rsquo;re full, look at me,&rdquo; Izuku said. &ldquo;I barely managed to finish my Hola-Hola, I don&rsquo;t think I have enough room for dinner.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Say, Midoriya, what is a Hola-Hola?&rdquo; Tsuyu asked. &ldquo;It looked really good.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s shaved ice and evaporated milk layered with sweet gelatin and fruit topped off with ice cream and a piece of flan,&rdquo; Izuku explained contently. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the best.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s sound delicious,&rdquo; Tsuyu said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to try it, ribbit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hold on, I think we&rsquo;ve had more than enough to eat today,&rdquo; Iida said sternly. &ldquo;As heroes in training, we shouldn&rsquo;t gorge ourselves on fast food.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, we could always just come back here next week,&rdquo; Todoroki said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to try the noodles Uraraka got.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a great idea,&rdquo; Uraraka exclaimed. &ldquo;How about we do this every week, every Friday after school.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That sounds awesome,&rdquo; Izuku replied.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like that, ribbit,&rdquo; Tsuyu said.</p><p>&ldquo;I think that would be an excellent idea,&rdquo; Iida said. &ldquo;It would be a terrific bonding experience for all of us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;d get to eat more fried chicken,&rdquo; Todoroki said bluntly.</p><p>Iida nodded. &ldquo;That as well.&rdquo;</p><p>And so, the five friends left the restaurant with smiles on their faces, looking forward to the days ahead.</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>I hope you liked it Fran!</p>",
