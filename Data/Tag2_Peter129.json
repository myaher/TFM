Getting good grades in high school, spending time with Tony Stark (!!!) on his weekends, and at night, he roams the city as the hero known as Spider-Man! Everything changes when a new student shows up at Midtown who seems determined to take it all away from him.<br/></p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17695649/chapters/42137126\" target=\"_blank\">AO3</a> | <a href=\"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13200736/5/All-I-see-is-green\" target=\"_blank\">FF.net</a></p><hr><p>\u201cSlow your roll, asshole, unless you want some extra holes in that body of yours.\u201d</p><p>Harley put up his hands, immediately without turning around, and stopped walking, remembering what Tony had told him about the dangers of walking around on your own in New York.\u00a0He couldn\u2019t help but glance down at the, most likely, ridiculously expensive jacket he was wearing, which Tony had insisted on buying him. Combine this with his lithe, youthful appearance, and you basically had a bright neon sign over his head that says: \u2018Rob me, please!\u2019</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want any trouble,\u201d he states for good measure, and turns his head slightly to try and catch a glimpse of what his attacker is doing. He barely caught sight of a figure with a hoodie drawn over his cap, casting an impenetrable shadow over his face, with a black-clad arm reaching out to the back of Harley\u2019s head, when he felt a harsh cold pressure to the back of his head, and flinched away when he realised that it was the barrel of a handgun. </p><p>\u201cNo funny games,\u201d the figure behind him grunted. \u201cJust slowly reach down, take out your wallet and phone and hand them to me. Don\u2019t even think about turning around, screaming, fighting or running away, because I will put a bullet in your brain before you can finish the thought.\u201d Harley shivered, a lump in his throat making it difficult to breath. His hand trembled as it reached into his jacket pocket, and took out his phone, reaching back to hold it out for the figure to take. It was yanked out of his hands without warning. </p><p>\u201cYour wallet,\u201d the voice pressed urgently behind him, \u201cand hand over your watch too.\u201d His watch\u2026 Harley\u2019s heart skipped a beat as he was reminded of the elaborate smart watch that sat on his wrist, equipped with all kinds of applications and gadgets, and a panic button that sends a distress signal straight to Tony. Of course!</p><p>\u201cM-my wallet is in my backpack,\u201d Harley stuttered out, raising his hands up again. \u201cLet me take off my watch.\u201d Keeping his hands in the air to show that he wasn\u2019t taking out anything else, Harley started fidgeting with the claps of his watch. With as much subtlety as he could muster, he pressed the tiny red knob on his watch, which vibrated gently in acknowledgement. Just as he finished unclasping the watch, another voice echoed through the alley, this time from up high. </p><p>\u201cYou know, most people don\u2019t really appreciate being held at gun point. You might want to stop that.\u201d Harley let out a sigh as relief washed over him, making his knees buckle under him. He knew that voice\u2026 He had heard it hundreds of times before in YouTube videos and the like. Immediately, an arm wrapped around his neck in a choke hold, his own hands involuntarily flying up to desperately grasp at the grip, and he was drawn backwards until his back met the figure\u2019s chest. The cold pressure of the gun has shifted to his temple, and he squeezed his eyes closed in fear as he gasped for breath. </p><p>\u201cGet the fuck out of here, Spider-Man, or I\u2019ll put a bullet in this fucking kid!\u201d Harley heard a thud as Spider-Man landed in front of them, but didn\u2019t dare open his eyes, his world narrowed down to the metal against his temple and the arm around his throat. He felt the chest behind him rapidly moving up and down as his attacker takes in one panic breath after another. </p><p>\u201cOkay, hey, slow down, there\u2019s no need for that.\u201d Spider-Man\u2019s voice had lost its earlier lightness, and sounded almost stern. \u201cI ain\u2019t looking for trouble if you\u2019re not making it. You got what you wanted. Just let the kid go, and walk away.\u201d Suddenly, Harley felt the gun being taken away from his temple as the figure behind him shoved him aggressively, and he stumbled forward, eyes snapping open and only seeing red and blue as a pair of spandex clad arms caught him gracefully. He looked up at Spider-Man\u2019s mask, but it was facing forward determinedly, as he helped Harley stay upright.</p><p>\u201cStay here, Harley,\u201d he spoke firmly, and he was off, a web slinging him to the furthest end of the alley, where, as Harley now noticed, the perpetrator was making a quick escape. He did not get far, however, as Spider-Man made quick work of webbing up his feet, and dragging him by his lower body towards the wall, continuously shooting webs at him to make the robber stick to it. </p><p>Harley let out a shaky breath as all adrenaline seemed to rush out of him simultaneously, and he could barely make it to the wall before his knees gave out entirely, dropping down on the concrete below, which emitted a strong stank of urine. He felt tired beyond belief, and wanted nothing more in that moment than to close his eyes, and fall asleep, be unconscious for a while and wake up in his bed in Tennessee by his sister jumping on his bed, and the smell of freshly fried eggs. He didn\u2019t notice when the tears started falling, but soon enough there were wet patches on his jeans where his face was pressed against his knees, which he had drawn to his chest in an attempt to make himself as small as humanly possible. </p><p>A sudden presence beside him startled him, but he calmed down when he realised it was none other than New York\u2019s wallcrawler, sitting on a urine-flooded alley next to a crying teenager who felt home sick. He didn\u2019t even say thank you\u2026 Harley started furiously wiping at his eyes, and sniffed a few times before he managed to find some form of composure. He opened his mouth to say something, anything, but was cut off by Spider-Man, who spoke first.</p><p>\u201cI got your phone back.\u201d It was then that Harley noticed the hand that was holding out the phone to him. He took it with a grateful smile, and an unreadable mask with white lenses glared back at him. Say thank you, say thank you, say thank you\u2026</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Wait, what? Spider-Man\u2019s head cocked in confusion.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you sorry for, Harley? None of this was your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know, but I should have known better than to- Wait a minute\u2026 How do you know my name?\u201d Harley suddenly remembered Spider-Man calling him \u2018Harley\u2019 earlier as well, although he had been too out-of-it to notice at the time. Suddenly, the mask was not as unreadable as it had seemed earlier when the white lenses gave away the widening of the eyes underneath.<br/>\u201cUh, I mean, I know all the names of the citizens of New York!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, like Santa Claus, or something,\u201d Harley laughed incredulously, both curious, worried and amused about the situation. </p><p>\u201cI mean, would you believe me if I said yes?\u201d Harley just raised an eyebrow in return, slowly feeling the weight on his shoulders lift some more. \u201cYeah, I figured as much. Okay, so, here\u2019s the truth. Mr. Stark told me about you.\u201d Of course! </p><p>\u201cThat makes sense. Tony mentioned you to me before too! But don\u2019t worry, nothing about your identity, or anything. Just that you had needed his help.\u201d Spider-Man let out an awkward laugh at that.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Mr. Iron Man and I are what I like to call co-dependant. He needs me as much as I need him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t, Underoos,\u201d a voice from beside them spoke, uncharacteristically quiet. Both Harley\u2019s and Spider-Man\u2019s heads snapped up at the sound of Tony Stark\u2019s voice, and stared at him as he stood before them, the Iron Man armour only a couple steps behind him, opened up. \u201cI think of it more as a mentor-mentee relationship, where you screw up sometimes, and I try to help you not screw up.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMr. Stark,\u201d Spider-Man laughed, but he was cut off by Harley getting up and launching himself at Tony, trembling from head to toe, the impact of the evening hitting him again at full force at the sight of his pseudo-dad. </p><p>\u201cShh, it\u2019s okay, kiddo,\u201d the older man whispered in his ear, as he pressed him close to his chest. \u201cI\u2019ve got you. I\u2019m right here.\u201d As Harley stood there, tightly wrapped up in Tony\u2019s embrace, a soft thwip was the only thing indicating Spider-Man\u2019s quiet departure from the scene. Distant police sirens could be heard approaching. </p><hr><p>\u201cYou, my friend, have had the craziest week ever, and that including the one where you were bitten by a radioactive spider and gained superpowers.\u201d Peter groaned pathetically from his position on Ned\u2019s lap, the latter of whom simply ignored him for the sake of stealthing his way across whatever video game he was playing, his hands holding the controller resting on Peter\u2019s chest. </p><p>\u201cTell me about it,\u201d Peter whined. \u201cAt least getting bitten by that spider and everything that followed was just facts, you know? This all involves feelings and social behaviour and puberty-\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs much as you\u2019re my best friend, and I truly sympathise with you,\u201d Ned interjected, as he casually took out at least four other players as he was talking. \u201cI think you\u2019re overthinking this. Be honest with yourself! The answer to all your current problems is right there: just talk to Harley! God knows he could use some friendship after what he went through, and by the way he was hunting you down in school today, it seems he\u2019s really eager to talk to you too.\u201d Peter groaned again, opening his eyes and absentmindedly glancing up at his best friend, who\u2019s full focus seemed to be on the TV screen in front of him. \u201cSomething\u2019s holding you back from talking to him though, am I right? What is it?\u201d </p><p>What was it? Honestly, Peter wished he could answer that question. Harley genuinely seemed to want to talk things out with him, and after his conversation with Mr. Stark, there was no real grudge that Peter found himself holding against the other teenager. It sounded like the boy was going through a lot, and in his own way, he was standing up for somebody he loved, or, at least, he thought he was. What had happened that evening was intense, much more than anybody should ever have to go through. Peter had been held at gun point more times that he could count, a job hazard, you could call it, but he never got used to the feeling that the person holding the gun could end everything in a split second, no questions asked, no going back. All they had to do was pull the trigger, and it would all be over. Peter squeezed his eyes closed again as his mind flashed with memories of his uncle, lying there surrounded by a puddle of his own blood\u2026</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Ned,\u201d he responded, a slight tremor in his voice giving away his current emotional state. Ned, ever the graceful friend, did not look away from the screen, but dropped one hand away from his controller, and onto Peter\u2019s chest as a sign of comfort. \u201cI want to talk to him, especially after what happened tonight\u2026 Mr. Stark will be there for him, but I just want to know if he\u2019s okay, you know? But then again, I wasn\u2019t there. Spider-Man was. And Spider-Man didn\u2019t get into a fight with him about Tony Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaving a secret identity is not easy, Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never thought it would be,\u201d Peter sighed in response. \u201cI just want to know what\u2019s holding me back from talking to Mr. Stark and Harley. I want to, I really do, but every single time I think about it, I feel like some freaky disembodied hand is trying to choke the life out of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, you\u2019re going to feel anxious about it, Pete,\u201d Ned responded, his hand pressing down slightly. \u201cYou feel hurt by both of them. But the only way to get rid of that anxiety is to communicate. Hell, even telling them that the idea of talking to them makes you anxious is already better than the radio silence you\u2019re giving now. Harley\u2019s not stupid: he knows you were avoiding him yesterday.\u201d Peter nodded in understanding, letting his friend\u2019s words sink in.</p><p>Honestly, knowing that Harley probably wanted to talk to him about something was both dauntingly terrifying and infinitely comforting. The situation was a chip on both of their shoulders, and they seemed equally eager to move past it, but Peter had no way of knowing how. After all, Harley still seemed awfully friendly with Flash, who hadn\u2019t let up on bullying Peter constantly since their last year of Middle School. He doubted Harley could change his mind about that. But not giving him a chance to redeem himself seemed wrong too, and he could almost hear his aunt in his head, telling him to \u2018never write of strangers at first sight, because strangers are just friends you haven\u2019t met yet\u2019. Na\u00efve, but not necessarily wrong. </p><p>Tomorrow, Peter promised himself. Tomorrow, he would set aside whatever was holding him back, and talk to Harley. <br/></p>",

Of course!</p><p>\u201cM-my wallet is in my backpack,\u201d Harley stuttered out, raising his hands up again. \u201cLet me take off my watch.\u201d Keeping his hands in the air to show that he wasn\u2019t taking out anything else, Harley started fidgeting with the claps of his watch. With as much subtlety as he could muster, he pressed the tiny red knob on his watch, which vibrated gently in acknowledgement. Just as he finished unclasping the watch, another voice echoed through the alley, this time from up high. </p><p>\u201cYou know, most people don\u2019t really appreciate being held at gun point. You might want to stop that.\u201d Harley let out a sigh as relief washed over him, making his knees buckle under him. He knew that voice\u2026 He had heard it hundreds of times before in YouTube videos and the like. Immediately, an arm wrapped around his neck in a choke hold, his own hands involuntarily flying up to desperately grasp at the grip, and he was drawn backwards until his back met the figure\u2019s chest. The cold pressure of the gun has shifted to his temple, and he squeezed his eyes closed in fear as he gasped for breath. </p><p>\u201cGet the fuck out of here, Spider-Man, or I\u2019ll put a bullet in this fucking kid!\u201d Harley heard a thud as Spider-Man landed in front of them, but didn\u2019t dare open his eyes, his world narrowed down to the metal against his temple and the arm around his throat. He felt the chest behind him rapidly moving up and down as his attacker takes in one panic breath after another. </p><p>\u201cOkay, hey, slow down, there\u2019s no need for that.\u201d Spider-Man\u2019s voice had lost its earlier lightness, and sounded almost stern. \u201cI ain\u2019t looking for trouble if you\u2019re not making it. You got what you wanted. Just let the kid go, and walk away.\u201d Suddenly, Harley felt the gun being taken away from his temple as the figure behind him shoved him aggressively, and he stumbled forward, eyes snapping open and only seeing red and blue as a pair of spandex clad arms caught him gracefully. He looked up at Spider-Man\u2019s mask, but it was facing forward determinedly, as he helped Harley stay upright.</p><p>\u201cStay here, Harley,\u201d he spoke firmly, and he was off, a web slinging him to the furthest end of the alley, where, as Harley now noticed, the perpetrator was making a quick escape. He did not get far, however, as Spider-Man made quick work of webbing up his feet, and dragging him by his lower body towards the wall, continuously shooting webs at him to make the robber stick to it. </p><p>Harley let out a shaky breath as all adrenaline seemed to rush out of him simultaneously, and he could barely make it to the wall before his knees gave out entirely, dropping down on the concrete below, which emitted a strong stank of urine. He felt tired beyond belief, and wanted nothing more in that moment than to close his eyes, and fall asleep, be unconscious for a while and wake up in his bed in Tennessee by his sister jumping on his bed, and the smell of freshly fried eggs. He didn\u2019t notice when the tears started falling, but soon enough there were wet patches on his jeans where his face was pressed against his knees, which he had drawn to his chest in an attempt to make himself as small as humanly possible. </p><p>A sudden presence beside him startled him, but he calmed down when he realised it was none other than New York\u2019s wallcrawler, sitting on a urine-flooded alley next to a crying teenager who felt home sick. He didn\u2019t even say thank you\u2026 Harley started furiously wiping at his eyes, and sniffed a few times before he managed to find some form of composure. He opened his mouth to say something, anything, but was cut off by Spider-Man, who spoke first.</p><p>\u201cI got your phone back.\u201d It was then that Harley noticed the hand that was holding out the phone to him. He took it with a grateful smile, and an unreadable mask with white lenses glared back at him. Say thank you, say thank you, say thank you\u2026</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Wait, what? Spider-Man\u2019s head cocked in confusion.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you sorry for, Harley? None of this was your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know, but I should have known better than to- Wait a minute\u2026 How do you know my name?\u201d Harley suddenly remembered Spider-Man calling him \u2018Harley\u2019 earlier as well, although he had been too out-of-it to notice at the time. Suddenly, the mask was not as unreadable as it had seemed earlier when the white lenses gave away the widening of the eyes underneath.<br>\u201cUh, I mean, I know all the names of the citizens of New York!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, like Santa Claus, or something,\u201d Harley laughed incredulously, both curious, worried and amused about the situation. </p><p>\u201cI mean, would you believe me if I said yes?\u201d Harley just raised an eyebrow in return, slowly feeling the weight on his shoulders lift some more. \u201cYeah, I figured as much. Okay, so, here\u2019s the truth. Mr. Stark told me about you.\u201d Of course! </p><p>\u201cThat makes sense. Tony mentioned you to me before too! But don\u2019t worry, nothing about your identity, or anything. Just that you had needed his help.\u201d Spider-Man let out an awkward laugh at that.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Mr. Iron Man and I are what I like to call co-dependant. He needs me as much as I need him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t, Underoos,\u201d a voice from beside them spoke, uncharacteristically quiet. Both Harley\u2019s and Spider-Man\u2019s heads snapped up at the sound of Tony Stark\u2019s voice, and stared at him as he stood before them, the Iron Man armour only a couple steps behind him, opened up. \u201cI think of it more as a mentor-mentee relationship, where you screw up sometimes, and I try to help you not screw up.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMr. Stark,\u201d Spider-Man laughed, but he was cut off by Harley getting up and launching himself at Tony, trembling from head to toe, the impact of the evening hitting him again at full force at the sight of his pseudo-dad. </p><p>\u201cShh, it\u2019s okay, kiddo,\u201d the older man whispered in his ear, as he pressed him close to his chest. \u201cI\u2019ve got you. I\u2019m right here.\u201d As Harley stood there, tightly wrapped up in Tony\u2019s embrace, a soft thwip was the only thing indicating Spider-Man\u2019s quiet departure from the scene. Distant police sirens could be heard approaching. </p><hr><p>\u201cYou, my friend, have had the craziest week ever, and that including the one where you were bitten by a radioactive spider and gained superpowers.\u201d Peter groaned pathetically from his position on Ned\u2019s lap, the latter of whom simply ignored him for the sake of stealthing his way across whatever video game he was playing, his hands holding the controller resting on Peter\u2019s chest. </p><p>\u201cTell me about it,\u201d Peter whined. \u201cAt least getting bitten by that spider and everything that followed was just facts, you know? This all involves feelings and social behaviour and puberty-\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs much as you\u2019re my best friend, and I truly sympathise with you,\u201d Ned interjected, as he casually took out at least four other players as he was talking. \u201cI think you\u2019re overthinking this. Be honest with yourself! The answer to all your current problems is right there: just talk to Harley! God knows he could use some friendship after what he went through, and by the way he was hunting you down in school today, it seems he\u2019s really eager to talk to you too.\u201d Peter groaned again, opening his eyes and absentmindedly glancing up at his best friend, who\u2019s full focus seemed to be on the TV screen in front of him. \u201cSomething\u2019s holding you back from talking to him though, am I right? What is it?\u201d </p><p>What was it? Honestly, Peter wished he could answer that question. Harley genuinely seemed to want to talk things out with him, and after his conversation with Mr. Stark, there was no real grudge that Peter found himself holding against the other teenager. It sounded like the boy was going through a lot, and in his own way, he was standing up for somebody he loved, or, at least, he thought he was. What had happened that evening was intense, much more than anybody should ever have to go through. Peter had been held at gun point more times that he could count, a job hazard, you could call it, but he never got used to the feeling that the person holding the gun could end everything in a split second, no questions asked, no going back. All they had to do was pull the trigger, and it would all be over. Peter squeezed his eyes closed again as his mind flashed with memories of his uncle, lying there surrounded by a puddle of his own blood\u2026</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Ned,\u201d he responded, a slight tremor in his voice giving away his current emotional state. Ned, ever the graceful friend, did not look away from the screen, but dropped one hand away from his controller, and onto Peter\u2019s chest as a sign of comfort. \u201cI want to talk to him, especially after what happened tonight\u2026 Mr. Stark will be there for him, but I just want to know if he\u2019s okay, you know? But then again, I wasn\u2019t there. Spider-Man was. And Spider-Man didn\u2019t get into a fight with him about Tony Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaving a secret identity is not easy, Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never thought it would be,\u201d Peter sighed in response. \u201cI just want to know what\u2019s holding me back from talking to Mr. Stark and Harley. I want to, I really do, but every single time I think about it, I feel like some freaky disembodied hand is trying to choke the life out of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, you\u2019re going to feel anxious about it, Pete,\u201d Ned responded, his hand pressing down slightly. \u201cYou feel hurt by both of them. But the only way to get rid of that anxiety is to communicate. Hell, even telling them that the idea of talking to them makes you anxious is already better than the radio silence you\u2019re giving now. Harley\u2019s not stupid: he knows you were avoiding him yesterday.\u201d Peter nodded in understanding, letting his friend\u2019s words sink in.</p><p>Honestly, knowing that Harley probably wanted to talk to him about something was both dauntingly terrifying and infinitely comforting. The situation was a chip on both of their shoulders, and they seemed equally eager to move past it, but Peter had no way of knowing how. After all, Harley still seemed awfully friendly with Flash, who hadn\u2019t let up on bullying Peter constantly since their last year of Middle School. He doubted Harley could change his mind about that. But not giving him a chance to redeem himself seemed wrong too, and he could almost hear his aunt in his head, telling him to \u2018never write of strangers at first sight, because strangers are just friends you haven\u2019t met yet\u2019. Na\u00efve, but not necessarily wrong. </p><p>Tomorrow, Peter promised himself. Tomorrow, he would set aside whatever was holding him back, and talk to Harley. <br></p></p>",

Getting good grades in high school, spending time with Tony Stark (!!!) on his weekends, and at night, he roams the city as the hero known as Spider-Man! Everything changes when a new student shows up at Midtown who seems determined to take it all away from him.<br></p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17695649/chapters/42137126\" target=\"_blank\">AO3</a> | <a href=\"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13200736/5/All-I-see-is-green\" target=\"_blank\">FF.net</a></p><hr><p>\u201cSlow your roll, asshole, unless you want some extra holes in that body of yours.\u201d</p><p>Harley put up his hands, immediately without turning around, and stopped walking, remembering what Tony had told him about the dangers of walking around on your own in New York.\u00a0He couldn\u2019t help but glance down at the, most likely, ridiculously expensive jacket he was wearing, which Tony had insisted on buying him. Combine this with his lithe, youthful appearance, and you basically had a bright neon sign over his head that says: \u2018Rob me, please!\u2019</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want any trouble,\u201d he states for good measure, and turns his head slightly to try and catch a glimpse of what his attacker is doing. He barely caught sight of a figure with a hoodie drawn over his cap, casting an impenetrable shadow over his face, with a black-clad arm reaching out to the back of Harley\u2019s head, when he felt a harsh cold pressure to the back of his head, and flinched away when he realised that it was the barrel of a handgun. </p><p>\u201cNo funny games,\u201d the figure behind him grunted. \u201cJust slowly reach down, take out your wallet and phone and hand them to me. Don\u2019t even think about turning around, screaming, fighting or running away, because I will put a bullet in your brain before you can finish the thought.\u201d Harley shivered, a lump in his throat making it difficult to breath. His hand trembled as it reached into his jacket pocket, and took out his phone, reaching back to hold it out for the figure to take. It was yanked out of his hands without warning. </p><p>\u201cYour wallet,\u201d the voice pressed urgently behind him, \u201cand hand over your watch too.\u201d His watch\u2026 Harley\u2019s heart skipped a beat as he was reminded of the elaborate smart watch that sat on his wrist, equipped with all kinds of applications and gadgets, and a panic button that sends a distress signal straight to Tony.

And Spider-Man didn\u2019t get into a fight with him about Tony Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaving a secret identity is not easy, Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never thought it would be,\u201d Peter sighed in response. \u201cI just want to know what\u2019s holding me back from talking to Mr. Stark and Harley. I want to, I really do, but every single time I think about it, I feel like some freaky disembodied hand is trying to choke the life out of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, you\u2019re going to feel anxious about it, Pete,\u201d Ned responded, his hand pressing down slightly. \u201cYou feel hurt by both of them. But the only way to get rid of that anxiety is to communicate. Hell, even telling them that the idea of talking to them makes you anxious is already better than the radio silence you\u2019re giving now. Harley\u2019s not stupid: he knows you were avoiding him yesterday.\u201d Peter nodded in understanding, letting his friend\u2019s words sink in.</p><p>Honestly, knowing that Harley probably wanted to talk to him about something was both dauntingly terrifying and infinitely comforting. The situation was a chip on both of their shoulders, and they seemed equally eager to move past it, but Peter had no way of knowing how. After all, Harley still seemed awfully friendly with Flash, who hadn\u2019t let up on bullying Peter constantly since their last year of Middle School. He doubted Harley could change his mind about that. But not giving him a chance to redeem himself seemed wrong too, and he could almost hear his aunt in his head, telling him to \u2018never write of strangers at first sight, because strangers are just friends you haven\u2019t met yet\u2019. Na\u00efve, but not necessarily wrong. </p><p>Tomorrow, Peter promised himself. Tomorrow, he would set aside whatever was holding him back, and talk to Harley. <br></p></p>",

Combine this with his lithe, youthful appearance, and you basically had a bright neon sign over his head that says: &lsquo;Rob me, please!&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any trouble,&rdquo; he states for good measure, and turns his head slightly to try and catch a glimpse of what his attacker is doing. He barely caught sight of a figure with a hoodie drawn over his cap, casting an impenetrable shadow over his face, with a black-clad arm reaching out to the back of Harley&rsquo;s head, when he felt a harsh cold pressure to the back of his head, and flinched away when he realised that it was the barrel of a handgun. </p><p>&ldquo;No funny games,&rdquo; the figure behind him grunted. &ldquo;Just slowly reach down, take out your wallet and phone and hand them to me. Don&rsquo;t even think about turning around, screaming, fighting or running away, because I will put a bullet in your brain before you can finish the thought.&rdquo; Harley shivered, a lump in his throat making it difficult to breath. His hand trembled as it reached into his jacket pocket, and took out his phone, reaching back to hold it out for the figure to take. It was yanked out of his hands without warning. </p><p>&ldquo;Your wallet,&rdquo; the voice pressed urgently behind him, &ldquo;and hand over your watch too.&rdquo; His watch&hellip; Harley&rsquo;s heart skipped a beat as he was reminded of the elaborate smart watch that sat on his wrist, equipped with all kinds of applications and gadgets, and a panic button that sends a distress signal straight to Tony. Of course!</p><p>&ldquo;M-my wallet is in my backpack,&rdquo; Harley stuttered out, raising his hands up again. &ldquo;Let me take off my watch.&rdquo; Keeping his hands in the air to show that he wasn&rsquo;t taking out anything else, Harley started fidgeting with the claps of his watch. With as much subtlety as he could muster, he pressed the tiny red knob on his watch, which vibrated gently in acknowledgement. Just as he finished unclasping the watch, another voice echoed through the alley, this time from up high. </p><p>&ldquo;You know, most people don&rsquo;t really appreciate being held at gun point. You might want to stop that.&rdquo; Harley let out a sigh as relief washed over him, making his knees buckle under him. He knew that voice&hellip; He had heard it hundreds of times before in YouTube videos and the like. Immediately, an arm wrapped around his neck in a choke hold, his own hands involuntarily flying up to desperately grasp at the grip, and he was drawn backwards until his back met the figure&rsquo;s chest. The cold pressure of the gun has shifted to his temple, and he squeezed his eyes closed in fear as he gasped for breath. </p><p>&ldquo;Get the fuck out of here, Spider-Man, or I&rsquo;ll put a bullet in this fucking kid!&rdquo; Harley heard a thud as Spider-Man landed in front of them, but didn&rsquo;t dare open his eyes, his world narrowed down to the metal against his temple and the arm around his throat. He felt the chest behind him rapidly moving up and down as his attacker takes in one panic breath after another. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay, hey, slow down, there&rsquo;s no need for that.&rdquo; Spider-Man&rsquo;s voice had lost its earlier lightness, and sounded almost stern. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t looking for trouble if you&rsquo;re not making it. You got what you wanted. Just let the kid go, and walk away.&rdquo; Suddenly, Harley felt the gun being taken away from his temple as the figure behind him shoved him aggressively, and he stumbled forward, eyes snapping open and only seeing red and blue as a pair of spandex clad arms caught him gracefully. He looked up at Spider-Man&rsquo;s mask, but it was facing forward determinedly, as he helped Harley stay upright.</p><p>&ldquo;Stay here, Harley,&rdquo; he spoke firmly, and he was off, a web slinging him to the furthest end of the alley, where, as Harley now noticed, the perpetrator was making a quick escape. He did not get far, however, as Spider-Man made quick work of webbing up his feet, and dragging him by his lower body towards the wall, continuously shooting webs at him to make the robber stick to it. </p><p>Harley let out a shaky breath as all adrenaline seemed to rush out of him simultaneously, and he could barely make it to the wall before his knees gave out entirely, dropping down on the concrete below, which emitted a strong stank of urine. He felt tired beyond belief, and wanted nothing more in that moment than to close his eyes, and fall asleep, be unconscious for a while and wake up in his bed in Tennessee by his sister jumping on his bed, and the smell of freshly fried eggs. He didn&rsquo;t notice when the tears started falling, but soon enough there were wet patches on his jeans where his face was pressed against his knees, which he had drawn to his chest in an attempt to make himself as small as humanly possible. </p><p>A sudden presence beside him startled him, but he calmed down when he realised it was none other than New York&rsquo;s wallcrawler, sitting on a urine-flooded alley next to a crying teenager who felt home sick. He didn&rsquo;t even say thank you&hellip; Harley started furiously wiping at his eyes, and sniffed a few times before he managed to find some form of composure. He opened his mouth to say something, anything, but was cut off by Spider-Man, who spoke first.</p><p>&ldquo;I got your phone back.&rdquo; It was then that Harley noticed the hand that was holding out the phone to him. He took it with a grateful smile, and an unreadable mask with white lenses glared back at him. Say thank you, say thank you, say thank you&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; Wait, what? Spider-Man&rsquo;s head cocked in confusion.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you sorry for, Harley? None of this was your fault.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know, I know, but I should have known better than to- Wait a minute&hellip; How do you know my name?&rdquo; Harley suddenly remembered Spider-Man calling him &lsquo;Harley&rsquo; earlier as well, although he had been too out-of-it to notice at the time. Suddenly, the mask was not as unreadable as it had seemed earlier when the white lenses gave away the widening of the eyes underneath.<br />&ldquo;Uh, I mean, I know all the names of the citizens of New York!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What, like Santa Claus, or something,&rdquo; Harley laughed incredulously, both curious, worried and amused about the situation. </p><p>&ldquo;I mean, would you believe me if I said yes?&rdquo; Harley just raised an eyebrow in return, slowly feeling the weight on his shoulders lift some more. &ldquo;Yeah, I figured as much. Okay, so, here&rsquo;s the truth. Mr. Stark told me about you.&rdquo; Of course! </p><p>&ldquo;That makes sense. Tony mentioned you to me before too! But don&rsquo;t worry, nothing about your identity, or anything. Just that you had needed his help.&rdquo; Spider-Man let out an awkward laugh at that.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, Mr. Iron Man and I are what I like to call co-dependant. He needs me as much as I need him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t, Underoos,&rdquo; a voice from beside them spoke, uncharacteristically quiet. Both Harley&rsquo;s and Spider-Man&rsquo;s heads snapped up at the sound of Tony Stark&rsquo;s voice, and stared at him as he stood before them, the Iron Man armour only a couple steps behind him, opened up. &ldquo;I think of it more as a mentor-mentee relationship, where you screw up sometimes, and I try to help you not screw up.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark,&rdquo; Spider-Man laughed, but he was cut off by Harley getting up and launching himself at Tony, trembling from head to toe, the impact of the evening hitting him again at full force at the sight of his pseudo-dad. </p><p>&ldquo;Shh, it&rsquo;s okay, kiddo,&rdquo; the older man whispered in his ear, as he pressed him close to his chest. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got you. I&rsquo;m right here.&rdquo; As Harley stood there, tightly wrapped up in Tony&rsquo;s embrace, a soft thwip was the only thing indicating Spider-Man&rsquo;s quiet departure from the scene. Distant police sirens could be heard approaching. </p><hr /><p>&ldquo;You, my friend, have had the craziest week ever, and that including the one where you were bitten by a radioactive spider and gained superpowers.&rdquo; Peter groaned pathetically from his position on Ned&rsquo;s lap, the latter of whom simply ignored him for the sake of stealthing his way across whatever video game he was playing, his hands holding the controller resting on Peter&rsquo;s chest. </p><p>&ldquo;Tell me about it,&rdquo; Peter whined. &ldquo;At least getting bitten by that spider and everything that followed was just facts, you know? This all involves feelings and social behaviour and puberty-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As much as you&rsquo;re my best friend, and I truly sympathise with you,&rdquo; Ned interjected, as he casually took out at least four other players as he was talking. &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re overthinking this. Be honest with yourself! The answer to all your current problems is right there: just talk to Harley! God knows he could use some friendship after what he went through, and by the way he was hunting you down in school today, it seems he&rsquo;s really eager to talk to you too.&rdquo; Peter groaned again, opening his eyes and absentmindedly glancing up at his best friend, who&rsquo;s full focus seemed to be on the TV screen in front of him. &ldquo;Something&rsquo;s holding you back from talking to him though, am I right? What is it?&rdquo; </p><p>What was it? Honestly, Peter wished he could answer that question. Harley genuinely seemed to want to talk things out with him, and after his conversation with Mr. Stark, there was no real grudge that Peter found himself holding against the other teenager. It sounded like the boy was going through a lot, and in his own way, he was standing up for somebody he loved, or, at least, he thought he was. What had happened that evening was intense, much more than anybody should ever have to go through. Peter had been held at gun point more times that he could count, a job hazard, you could call it, but he never got used to the feeling that the person holding the gun could end everything in a split second, no questions asked, no going back. All they had to do was pull the trigger, and it would all be over. Peter squeezed his eyes closed again as his mind flashed with memories of his uncle, lying there surrounded by a puddle of his own blood&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Ned,&rdquo; he responded, a slight tremor in his voice giving away his current emotional state. Ned, ever the graceful friend, did not look away from the screen, but dropped one hand away from his controller, and onto Peter&rsquo;s chest as a sign of comfort. &ldquo;I want to talk to him, especially after what happened tonight&hellip; Mr. Stark will be there for him, but I just want to know if he&rsquo;s okay, you know? But then again, I wasn&rsquo;t there. Spider-Man was. And Spider-Man didn&rsquo;t get into a fight with him about Tony Stark.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Having a secret identity is not easy, Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I never thought it would be,&rdquo; Peter sighed in response. &ldquo;I just want to know what&rsquo;s holding me back from talking to Mr. Stark and Harley. I want to, I really do, but every single time I think about it, I feel like some freaky disembodied hand is trying to choke the life out of me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course, you&rsquo;re going to feel anxious about it, Pete,&rdquo; Ned responded, his hand pressing down slightly. &ldquo;You feel hurt by both of them.
