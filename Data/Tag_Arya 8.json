I hope it\u2019s not too bad and happy midsummer!</p></blockquote><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Boo Boo Bull\u2019s Berry Bonanza<br/></b></p><p>The day had been long and frustrating. Arya entered the small corner store meaning to grab some frozen meal, but when even that seemed too much work - she was no mood for poking plastic and waiting for the microwave to do its thing - she headed for the cereals. She discarded anything that looked too healthy for her, that was not what she wanted. She wanted E-colours and sugar. And when she saw the garish and yet comforting shade of nearly neon purple that was the box of Boo Boo Bull\u2019s Berry Bonanza on the top shelf her mind was made. And as there was only one box of it, it felt like destiny.</p><p>Arya reached for the box, rose to her tiptoes and stretched her hand, fingers nearly brushing the colorful cardboard, but not quite. She huffed and flopped her hands down, quickly glancing was there a stepladder or crate or anything really she could stand on and grab her pink and purple cereal treat. There was nothing that wasn\u2019t made out of flimsy cardboard, and she hated to go ask for help. She reached again, cursing to whoever had though shelves this tall would be a good idea. Probably some smug tall person who had no idea how frustrating not reaching something was.</p><p>Her toes were hurting and Arya had to give up. She made a low and quiet grunt before facing up the fact that she needed to find someone taller to help her. She was already leaving to find someone when a guy appeared from behind the tall piles of soda crates, seemingly suddenly, almost stopping next to him.\u00a0</p><p>He looked sturdy and surly, in a quite interesting and hot way. Black unruly hair and bright blue eyes, wearing jeans and grey t-shirt, and one of those big headphones people who took listening music seriously, or pretending to be someone who wants to look like they were taking listening music seriously, had. And he was definitely tall enough to reach the top shelf. He was probably a head taller than Arya, who had stayed the same humble size since thirteen. </p><p>She had merely opened her mouth when he had already grabbed the purple cereal box, destined to be hers, and walking away.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Arya was surprised she reacted so fast and even more so that the tall stranger stopped. He turned, frowning, slightly moving his headphones from one of his ears. \u201cThose are my cereals.\u201d</p><p>The guy looked confused. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy cereals,\u201d Arya repeated and pointed the purple box. \u201cThat\u2019s mine, I was just grabbing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell grab another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t another, it was the last one.\u201d</p><p>The guy shrugged, moved his headphones back on and turned away.</p><p>Arya could&rsquo;ve left it. She could&rsquo;ve. Easily. Just let the guy leave, pick another sugary cereal from the shelf. It would\u2019ve been easy.</p><!-- more --><p>But she had already decided she was destined to get the Berry Bonanza, and he was being kind of rude. She took a few quick running steps, twisted herself in his way at the narrow aisle. He grunted when he had to make such a sudden stop, and yanked his headphones down, to dangle on his neck.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat&rsquo;s my cereals,\u201d Arya said between her teeth. \u201cPick some other brand. I want the Berry Bonanza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you five or something?\u201d The guy asked, raking his black mop of a hair, looking frustrated. \u201cI grabbed it, it\u2019s my box.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was reaching it first, you just grabbed it in front of my nose while I was asking could you hand it to me because I couldn&rsquo;t reach it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, lady, I don\u2019t know what your deal is but I took the box from the self fair and square. So could you please step away from my way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really care to be honest.\u201d</p><p>Arya gritted her teeth, her hands balled into fists. She wanted that cereal box and she was ready to fight for it if it came to that. But then he was sort of huge and looked super stubborn, so quickly she changed her strategy, she was nothing if not adaptable.</p><p>\u201cListen, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Arya sighed. \u201cI am just having a bad day and Boo Boo Bull\u2019s Berry Bonanza is sort of comfort food for me.\u201d</p><p>The guy made the kind of small hmph that indicated that he understood her.</p><p>\u201cCould you maybe find it in your heart to let me have this one,\u201d she asked, making a slightly awkward little smile, played innocent and fragile like she was a baby bird.</p><p>The guy frowned slightly deeper, Arya could see him starting to crack. He glanced the box and Arya made a slightly sad face.</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m just a dainty girl. I need the sustenance,\u201d she muttered and tried her hardest to look like maybe she would wither away if she wouldn\u2019t eat pink and purple cereals right now.</p><p>His face tensed up immediately. \u201cThere is nothing dainty about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look like you probably start bar fights,\u201d the guy accused. \u201cLike you probably have a knife in your bag.\u201d</p><p>Arya eyed her gym bag in which she definitely had the switchblade Jon had given her. \u201cWell, what if I have? I still want my Berry Bonanza.\u201d She tried to grab the box. The guy pulled it away and tried to swat her further like she was a fly.</p><p>\u201cYou are really a pain in the arse, has anybody ever told you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out my way!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me my Boo Boo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you are gonna do, fight for it?\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>The day had been long and frustrating. Gendry leaned his head against the grey tile wall behind him. He had just wanted some comfort and sugar into his system. It was going to be just a quick trip to the corner store to grab his cereals and head out. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I got arrested because of cereals,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>The girl sitting a few chairs away, on the same hard plastic chairs snorted. \u201cNo one\u2019s arrested, you\u2019re exaggerating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell we are at the police station,\u201d Gendry pointed out the obvious. \u201cAnd the shop owner is still trying to decide if he&rsquo;s going to sue, so it\u2019s not really exaggerating.\u201d He peered at the girl, her arms were crossed and she was scowling him back. She was annoying. And insanely cute with her big grey eyes and perky ponytail, soft pink pursed lips, looking healthy like she had just left the gym. Her hair looked still slightly damp from the shower. She probably smelled really nice if he would lean in closer. He wasn\u2019t going to, though, she had almost gotten him arrested. And now her cuteness was distracting him from her annoyingness.</p><p>\u201cHe is not gonna sue,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like anything even happened. Though if he for some reason is going to sue, that\u2019s going to be on you, because you were the one who knocked down the flat of pasta sauce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you basically tackled me!\u201d</p><p>She just huffed. \u201cI barely touched you. A slight shove. <i>A slight.</i>\u201d</p><p>Gendry shook his head and turned away from her. He couldn&rsquo;t believe that he was at the police station because of that stupid box of cereals.</p><p>The younger of the two officers that had arrived at the shop was approaching them. Gendry was happy it wasn&rsquo;t the tall blonde. She had been scary. He in the other hand seemed relaxed and the kind of person who would understand that sometimes even good people were pulled into weird situations, because of other, smaller and crazier people. Gendry straightened his back.</p><p>\u201cThe owner has decided not to press charges,\u201d the officer said.</p><p>Gendry sighed. He glanced at the girl, who was peering him back again, looked like she wanted to say<i> I told you so</i>, but also secretly relieved. \u201cBut you need to pay for the damage you caused -\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201c- and you are both apparently barred for the shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s an overreaction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease shut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen there is this,\u201d the officer said and lifted the nearly neon purple Boo Boo Bull\u2019s Berry Bonanza box.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s mine,\u201d she said quickly. </p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not,\u201d Gendry claimed.</p><p>\u201cI bought it.\u201d</p><p>Gendry scowled at her when she reached her hand and the officer handed the cereal box to her. She looked cute even while incredibly smug.</p><p>\u201cPlease get out of here,\u201d the officer sighed.</p><p>***</p><p>Arya marched out of the police station, keeping her pace brisk, cradling her cereal box against her chest like an artificial berry flavored child.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t buy it,\u201d he said as soon as he entered behind her, and Arya spun to face him, then turned quickly back into walking.</p><p>\u201cPretty sure I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou grabbed it from me when they were already escorting us out, threw a tenner to the cashier and shouted keep the change,\u201d He squinted at her with his eyes narrowed to thin lines. \u201cIt was a dick move.\u201d</p><p>Arya jiggled her cereal box. \u201cIt worked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill a dick move.\u201d</p><p>She stopped and sighed. He looked still so surly, and Arya felt sort of guilty for all the trouble they had gone through because of the box of cereals. \u201cListen, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cI know I said it before, but that was clearly an act. But now I\u2019m being serious. I\u2019m sorry that all this happened. And I\u2019m sure you think I\u2019m a crazy person. But I\u2019m not, I\u2019m quite nice actually.\u201d His brow cocked up like he was doubting her. \u201cBut I really needed some pick me up today and when I moved here to attend uni I practically lived on Berry Bonanza like three years. It helped me then and it\u2019s gonna help me now. I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t care about it, but in case you do, just know that this box and these sort of disgusting cereals mean the world to me.\u201d</p><p>The guy looked like he considered what to say for a moment and then nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, it\u2019s just cereals. Maybe I can find some other place that sells them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think this it\u2019s too late for that,\u201d Arya said, feeling suddenly apologetic.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWell, what can you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you probably grew up eating these, so you have had your fair share. We didn\u2019t have these up North.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he admitted, and for the first time, his face softened. \u201cMy mom bought them for me for a special treat. Nothing really makes you feel like five years old with no cares in the world than drinking that purple leftover milk from the bowl.\u201d There was a hint of a smile on his lips. \u201cHe used to\u2026 call me his little bullhead.\u201d A shade of pink flushed his cheeks after that and he clearly regretted saying that last part.</p><p>Arya hummed, cracked a smile for him. He was really cute. \u201cI guess you just have to go visit your mom and hope that she has some in her cupboards.\u201d</p><p>His eyes dropped from hers and he shrugged again. \u201cShe died when I was seven so probably not.\u201d</p><p>Arya\u2019s face sank and the hand holding the box relaxed to hang limp against her side. He didn\u2019t look like he was making it up or even saying things just to appeal her emotions. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you just played the dead mom card.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that, I just -</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Aya sighed, glanced the garish purple box and then handed it towards him. \u201cJust take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake it before I change my mind. I\u2019m not gonna take cereals from someone who bought them because of their dead mom. I\u2019m not a monster.\u201d He didn\u2019t move, just looked at her, so finally, Arya shook her hand and the box rattled. He reached to take it from her. \u201cEnjoy,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Arya looked at the box in his big hands. \u201cI\u2019m gonna miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was clearly talking to the box,\u201d Arya said when he looked so awkward suddenly. \u201cI mean I was looking at it. You better take good care of it.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, but the corners of his lips were tugging up.</p><p>Arya didn\u2019t know what to say anymore, there wasn\u2019t much to say. They had met. They had fought over cereals and almost got arrested. Now they parted their ways. She made weird twitch with her shoulders when waving felt too much and turned to leave.</p><p>\u201cI live a few blocks away.\u201d</p><p>Arya turned back to face him.</p><p>\u201cAnd I have milk.\u201d He looked surly again, but differently than before, like he didn&rsquo;t quite know what to do and it was annoying him. \u201cYou wanna grab a\u2026 bowl?\u201d</p><p>Arya hadn\u2019t looked the time, but it was already dark and she was standing in the street, in front of the police station and a hot stranger she had had a brawl with was inviting her to a bowl of cereals. It was not the way she had thought to spend her night. \u201cDon\u2019t you have any friends to spend time with?\u201d</p><p>\u201c&hellip;no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you don\u2019t. You have no mom and no friends. How\u2019s your dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever met him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really walked into that one, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>He snorted, his smile was baring his teeth. Arya shook her head, trying not to smile herself.</p><p>\u201cWell lead the way, I guess,\u201d she said, moving towards him, her mind made. She would now have to be his friend. He had no other and he had her favorite cereals already. They started walking further down the street. \u201cI\u2019m Arya. Do you have a name, sad boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGendry. And I\u2019m not sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, it\u2019s like you were built in a sad-angry-hot-boy-factory. Here, let me help and carry those.\u201d Her hand reached toward the box, almost grabbing it while he looked surprised she had accidentally let slip out the fact that she thought he was hot. But Arya couldn&rsquo;t imagine he wouldn&rsquo;t already know it, surely there had been girls telling him that before. At the last moment, he managed to gather himself and pull the box away from her reach.</p><p>\u201cNice try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to steal them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn&rsquo;t. And I can\u2019t, because technically they are mine. I bought them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith a dick move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd real money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis should be considered a tie because I bought the milk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt the milk cost ten dragons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither did the cereals. Paying that much was your own choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the only bill I had! I\u2019m just lucky I didn\u2019t end up paying more.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, looked at her in a weirdly soft way Arya wasn\u2019t sure anyone had ever looked at her before. She could just feel how she would end up work tomorrow wearing what she was wearing right now, having Berry Bonanza for breakfast, and probably a hickey on her neck.</p>",

It would\u2019ve been easy.</p>[[MORE]]<p>But she had already decided she was destined to get the Berry Bonanza, and he was being kind of rude. She took a few quick running steps, twisted herself in his way at the narrow aisle. He grunted when he had to make such a sudden stop, and yanked his headphones down, to dangle on his neck.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my cereals,\u201d Arya said between her teeth. \u201cPick some other brand. I want the Berry Bonanza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you five or something?\u201d The guy asked, raking his black mop of a hair, looking frustrated. \u201cI grabbed it, it\u2019s my box.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was reaching it first, you just grabbed it in front of my nose while I was asking could you hand it to me because I couldn\u2019t reach it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, lady, I don\u2019t know what your deal is but I took the box from the self fair and square. So could you please step away from my way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really care to be honest.\u201d</p><p>Arya gritted her teeth, her hands balled into fists. She wanted that cereal box and she was ready to fight for it if it came to that. But then he was sort of huge and looked super stubborn, so quickly she changed her strategy, she was nothing if not adaptable.</p><p>\u201cListen, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Arya sighed. \u201cI am just having a bad day and Boo Boo Bull\u2019s Berry Bonanza is sort of comfort food for me.\u201d</p><p>The guy made the kind of small hmph that indicated that he understood her.</p><p>\u201cCould you maybe find it in your heart to let me have this one,\u201d she asked, making a slightly awkward little smile, played innocent and fragile like she was a baby bird.</p><p>The guy frowned slightly deeper, Arya could see him starting to crack. He glanced the box and Arya made a slightly sad face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just a dainty girl. I need the sustenance,\u201d she muttered and tried her hardest to look like maybe she would wither away if she wouldn\u2019t eat pink and purple cereals right now.</p><p>His face tensed up immediately. \u201cThere is nothing dainty about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look like you probably start bar fights,\u201d the guy accused. \u201cLike you probably have a knife in your bag.\u201d</p><p>Arya eyed her gym bag in which she definitely had the switchblade Jon had given her. \u201cWell, what if I have? I still want my Berry Bonanza.\u201d She tried to grab the box. The guy pulled it away and tried to swat her further like she was a fly.</p><p>\u201cYou are really a pain in the arse, has anybody ever told you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out my way!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me my Boo Boo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you are gonna do, fight for it?\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>The day had been long and frustrating. Gendry leaned his head against the grey tile wall behind him. He had just wanted some comfort and sugar into his system. It was going to be just a quick trip to the corner store to grab his cereals and head out. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I got arrested because of cereals,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>The girl sitting a few chairs away, on the same hard plastic chairs snorted. \u201cNo one\u2019s arrested, you\u2019re exaggerating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell we are at the police station,\u201d Gendry pointed out the obvious. \u201cAnd the shop owner is still trying to decide if he\u2019s going to sue, so it\u2019s not really exaggerating.\u201d He peered at the girl, her arms were crossed and she was scowling him back. She was annoying. And insanely cute with her big grey eyes and perky ponytail, soft pink pursed lips, looking healthy like she had just left the gym. Her hair looked still slightly damp from the shower. She probably smelled really nice if he would lean in closer. He wasn\u2019t going to, though, she had almost gotten him arrested. And now her cuteness was distracting him from her annoyingness.</p><p>\u201cHe is not gonna sue,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like anything even happened. Though if he for some reason is going to sue, that\u2019s going to be on you, because you were the one who knocked down the flat of pasta sauce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you basically tackled me!\u201d</p><p>She just huffed. \u201cI barely touched you. A slight shove. <i>A slight.</i>\u201d</p><p>Gendry shook his head and turned away from her. He couldn\u2019t believe that he was at the police station because of that stupid box of cereals.</p><p>The younger of the two officers that had arrived at the shop was approaching them. Gendry was happy it wasn\u2019t the tall blonde. She had been scary. He in the other hand seemed relaxed and the kind of person who would understand that sometimes even good people were pulled into weird situations, because of other, smaller and crazier people. Gendry straightened his back.</p><p>\u201cThe owner has decided not to press charges,\u201d the officer said.</p><p>Gendry sighed. He glanced at the girl, who was peering him back again, looked like she wanted to say<i> I told you so</i>, but also secretly relieved. \u201cBut you need to pay for the damage you caused -\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201c- and you are both apparently barred for the shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s an overreaction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease shut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen there is this,\u201d the officer said and lifted the nearly neon purple Boo Boo Bull\u2019s Berry Bonanza box.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s mine,\u201d she said quickly. </p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not,\u201d Gendry claimed.</p><p>\u201cI bought it.\u201d</p><p>Gendry scowled at her when she reached her hand and the officer handed the cereal box to her. She looked cute even while incredibly smug.</p><p>\u201cPlease get out of here,\u201d the officer sighed.</p><p>***</p><p>Arya marched out of the police station, keeping her pace brisk, cradling her cereal box against her chest like an artificial berry flavored child.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t buy it,\u201d he said as soon as he entered behind her, and Arya spun to face him, then turned quickly back into walking.</p><p>\u201cPretty sure I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou grabbed it from me when they were already escorting us out, threw a tenner to the cashier and shouted keep the change,\u201d He squinted at her with his eyes narrowed to thin lines. \u201cIt was a dick move.\u201d</p><p>Arya jiggled her cereal box. \u201cIt worked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill a dick move.\u201d</p><p>She stopped and sighed. He looked still so surly, and Arya felt sort of guilty for all the trouble they had gone through because of the box of cereals. \u201cListen, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cI know I said it before, but that was clearly an act. But now I\u2019m being serious. I\u2019m sorry that all this happened. And I\u2019m sure you think I\u2019m a crazy person. But I\u2019m not, I\u2019m quite nice actually.\u201d His brow cocked up like he was doubting her. \u201cBut I really needed some pick me up today and when I moved here to attend uni I practically lived on Berry Bonanza like three years. It helped me then and it\u2019s gonna help me now. I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t care about it, but in case you do, just know that this box and these sort of disgusting cereals mean the world to me.\u201d</p><p>The guy looked like he considered what to say for a moment and then nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, it\u2019s just cereals. Maybe I can find some other place that sells them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think this it\u2019s too late for that,\u201d Arya said, feeling suddenly apologetic.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWell, what can you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you probably grew up eating these, so you have had your fair share. We didn\u2019t have these up North.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he admitted, and for the first time, his face softened. \u201cMy mom bought them for me for a special treat. Nothing really makes you feel like five years old with no cares in the world than drinking that purple leftover milk from the bowl.\u201d There was a hint of a smile on his lips. \u201cHe used to\u2026 call me his little bullhead.\u201d A shade of pink flushed his cheeks after that and he clearly regretted saying that last part.</p><p>Arya hummed, cracked a smile for him. He was really cute. \u201cI guess you just have to go visit your mom and hope that she has some in her cupboards.\u201d</p><p>His eyes dropped from hers and he shrugged again. \u201cShe died when I was seven so probably not.\u201d</p><p>Arya\u2019s face sank and the hand holding the box relaxed to hang limp against her side. He didn\u2019t look like he was making it up or even saying things just to appeal her emotions. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you just played the dead mom card.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that, I just -</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Aya sighed, glanced the garish purple box and then handed it towards him. \u201cJust take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake it before I change my mind. I\u2019m not gonna take cereals from someone who bought them because of their dead mom. I\u2019m not a monster.\u201d He didn\u2019t move, just looked at her, so finally, Arya shook her hand and the box rattled. He reached to take it from her. \u201cEnjoy,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Arya looked at the box in his big hands. \u201cI\u2019m gonna miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was clearly talking to the box,\u201d Arya said when he looked so awkward suddenly. \u201cI mean I was looking at it. You better take good care of it.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, but the corners of his lips were tugging up.</p><p>Arya didn\u2019t know what to say anymore, there wasn\u2019t much to say. They had met. They had fought over cereals and almost got arrested. Now they parted their ways. She made weird twitch with her shoulders when waving felt too much and turned to leave.</p><p>\u201cI live a few blocks away.\u201d</p><p>Arya turned back to face him.</p><p>\u201cAnd I have milk.\u201d He looked surly again, but differently than before, like he didn\u2019t quite know what to do and it was annoying him. \u201cYou wanna grab a\u2026 bowl?\u201d</p><p>Arya hadn\u2019t looked the time, but it was already dark and she was standing in the street, in front of the police station and a hot stranger she had had a brawl with was inviting her to a bowl of cereals. It was not the way she had thought to spend her night. \u201cDon\u2019t you have any friends to spend time with?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you don\u2019t. You have no mom and no friends. How\u2019s your dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever met him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really walked into that one, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>He snorted, his smile was baring his teeth. Arya shook her head, trying not to smile herself.</p><p>\u201cWell lead the way, I guess,\u201d she said, moving towards him, her mind made. She would now have to be his friend. He had no other and he had her favorite cereals already. They started walking further down the street. \u201cI\u2019m Arya. Do you have a name, sad boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGendry. And I\u2019m not sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, it\u2019s like you were built in a sad-angry-hot-boy-factory. Here, let me help and carry those.\u201d Her hand reached toward the box, almost grabbing it while he looked surprised she had accidentally let slip out the fact that she thought he was hot. But Arya couldn\u2019t imagine he wouldn\u2019t already know it, surely there had been girls telling him that before. At the last moment, he managed to gather himself and pull the box away from her reach.</p><p>\u201cNice try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to steal them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t. And I can\u2019t, because technically they are mine. I bought them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith a dick move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd real money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis should be considered a tie because I bought the milk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt the milk cost ten dragons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither did the cereals. Paying that much was your own choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the only bill I had! I\u2019m just lucky I didn\u2019t end up paying more.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, looked at her in a weirdly soft way Arya wasn\u2019t sure anyone had ever looked at her before. She could just feel how she would end up work tomorrow wearing what she was wearing right now, having Berry Bonanza for breakfast, and probably a hickey on her neck.</p>",

Arya entered the small corner store meaning to grab some frozen meal, but when even that seemed too much work - she was no mood for poking plastic and waiting for the microwave to do its thing - she headed for the cereals. She discarded anything that looked too healthy for her, that was not what she wanted. She wanted E-colours and sugar. And when she saw the garish and yet comforting shade of nearly neon purple that was the box of Boo Boo Bull\u2019s Berry Bonanza on the top shelf her mind was made. And as there was only one box of it, it felt like destiny.</p><p>Arya reached for the box, rose to her tiptoes and stretched her hand, fingers nearly brushing the colorful cardboard, but not quite. She huffed and flopped her hands down, quickly glancing was there a stepladder or crate or anything really she could stand on and grab her pink and purple cereal treat. There was nothing that wasn\u2019t made out of flimsy cardboard, and she hated to go ask for help. She reached again, cursing to whoever had though shelves this tall would be a good idea. Probably some smug tall person who had no idea how frustrating not reaching something was.</p><p>Her toes were hurting and Arya had to give up. She made a low and quiet grunt before facing up the fact that she needed to find someone taller to help her. She was already leaving to find someone when a guy appeared from behind the tall piles of soda crates, seemingly suddenly, almost stopping next to him.\u00a0</p><p>He looked sturdy and surly, in a quite interesting and hot way. Black unruly hair and bright blue eyes, wearing jeans and grey t-shirt, and one of those big headphones people who took listening music seriously, or pretending to be someone who wants to look like they were taking listening music seriously, had. And he was definitely tall enough to reach the top shelf. He was probably a head taller than Arya, who had stayed the same humble size since thirteen. </p><p>She had merely opened her mouth when he had already grabbed the purple cereal box, destined to be hers, and walking away.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Arya was surprised she reacted so fast and even more so that the tall stranger stopped. He turned, frowning, slightly moving his headphones from one of his ears. \u201cThose are my cereals.\u201d</p><p>The guy looked confused. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy cereals,\u201d Arya repeated and pointed the purple box. \u201cThat\u2019s mine, I was just grabbing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell grab another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t another, it was the last one.\u201d</p><p>The guy shrugged, moved his headphones back on and turned away.</p><p>Arya could\u2019ve left it. She could\u2019ve. Easily. Just let the guy leave, pick another sugary cereal from the shelf. It would\u2019ve been easy.</p>[[MORE]]<p>But she had already decided she was destined to get the Berry Bonanza, and he was being kind of rude. She took a few quick running steps, twisted herself in his way at the narrow aisle. He grunted when he had to make such a sudden stop, and yanked his headphones down, to dangle on his neck.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my cereals,\u201d Arya said between her teeth. \u201cPick some other brand. I want the Berry Bonanza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you five or something?\u201d The guy asked, raking his black mop of a hair, looking frustrated. \u201cI grabbed it, it\u2019s my box.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was reaching it first, you just grabbed it in front of my nose while I was asking could you hand it to me because I couldn\u2019t reach it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, lady, I don\u2019t know what your deal is but I took the box from the self fair and square. So could you please step away from my way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really care to be honest.\u201d</p><p>Arya gritted her teeth, her hands balled into fists. She wanted that cereal box and she was ready to fight for it if it came to that. But then he was sort of huge and looked super stubborn, so quickly she changed her strategy, she was nothing if not adaptable.</p><p>\u201cListen, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Arya sighed. \u201cI am just having a bad day and Boo Boo Bull\u2019s Berry Bonanza is sort of comfort food for me.\u201d</p><p>The guy made the kind of small hmph that indicated that he understood her.</p><p>\u201cCould you maybe find it in your heart to let me have this one,\u201d she asked, making a slightly awkward little smile, played innocent and fragile like she was a baby bird.</p><p>The guy frowned slightly deeper, Arya could see him starting to crack. He glanced the box and Arya made a slightly sad face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just a dainty girl. I need the sustenance,\u201d she muttered and tried her hardest to look like maybe she would wither away if she wouldn\u2019t eat pink and purple cereals right now.</p><p>His face tensed up immediately. \u201cThere is nothing dainty about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look like you probably start bar fights,\u201d the guy accused. \u201cLike you probably have a knife in your bag.\u201d</p><p>Arya eyed her gym bag in which she definitely had the switchblade Jon had given her. \u201cWell, what if I have? I still want my Berry Bonanza.\u201d She tried to grab the box. The guy pulled it away and tried to swat her further like she was a fly.</p><p>\u201cYou are really a pain in the arse, has anybody ever told you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out my way!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me my Boo Boo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you are gonna do, fight for it?\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>The day had been long and frustrating. Gendry leaned his head against the grey tile wall behind him. He had just wanted some comfort and sugar into his system. It was going to be just a quick trip to the corner store to grab his cereals and head out. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I got arrested because of cereals,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>The girl sitting a few chairs away, on the same hard plastic chairs snorted. \u201cNo one\u2019s arrested, you\u2019re exaggerating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell we are at the police station,\u201d Gendry pointed out the obvious. \u201cAnd the shop owner is still trying to decide if he\u2019s going to sue, so it\u2019s not really exaggerating.\u201d He peered at the girl, her arms were crossed and she was scowling him back. She was annoying. And insanely cute with her big grey eyes and perky ponytail, soft pink pursed lips, looking healthy like she had just left the gym. Her hair looked still slightly damp from the shower. She probably smelled really nice if he would lean in closer. He wasn\u2019t going to, though, she had almost gotten him arrested. And now her cuteness was distracting him from her annoyingness.</p><p>\u201cHe is not gonna sue,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like anything even happened. Though if he for some reason is going to sue, that\u2019s going to be on you, because you were the one who knocked down the flat of pasta sauce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you basically tackled me!\u201d</p><p>She just huffed. \u201cI barely touched you. A slight shove. <i>A slight.</i>\u201d</p><p>Gendry shook his head and turned away from her. He couldn\u2019t believe that he was at the police station because of that stupid box of cereals.</p><p>The younger of the two officers that had arrived at the shop was approaching them. Gendry was happy it wasn\u2019t the tall blonde. She had been scary. He in the other hand seemed relaxed and the kind of person who would understand that sometimes even good people were pulled into weird situations, because of other, smaller and crazier people. Gendry straightened his back.</p><p>\u201cThe owner has decided not to press charges,\u201d the officer said.</p><p>Gendry sighed. He glanced at the girl, who was peering him back again, looked like she wanted to say<i> I told you so</i>, but also secretly relieved. \u201cBut you need to pay for the damage you caused -\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201c- and you are both apparently barred for the shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s an overreaction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease shut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen there is this,\u201d the officer said and lifted the nearly neon purple Boo Boo Bull\u2019s Berry Bonanza box.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s mine,\u201d she said quickly. </p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not,\u201d Gendry claimed.</p><p>\u201cI bought it.\u201d</p><p>Gendry scowled at her when she reached her hand and the officer handed the cereal box to her. She looked cute even while incredibly smug.</p><p>\u201cPlease get out of here,\u201d the officer sighed.</p><p>***</p><p>Arya marched out of the police station, keeping her pace brisk, cradling her cereal box against her chest like an artificial berry flavored child.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t buy it,\u201d he said as soon as he entered behind her, and Arya spun to face him, then turned quickly back into walking.</p><p>\u201cPretty sure I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou grabbed it from me when they were already escorting us out, threw a tenner to the cashier and shouted keep the change,\u201d He squinted at her with his eyes narrowed to thin lines. \u201cIt was a dick move.\u201d</p><p>Arya jiggled her cereal box. \u201cIt worked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill a dick move.\u201d</p><p>She stopped and sighed. He looked still so surly, and Arya felt sort of guilty for all the trouble they had gone through because of the box of cereals. \u201cListen, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cI know I said it before, but that was clearly an act. But now I\u2019m being serious. I\u2019m sorry that all this happened. And I\u2019m sure you think I\u2019m a crazy person. But I\u2019m not, I\u2019m quite nice actually.\u201d His brow cocked up like he was doubting her. \u201cBut I really needed some pick me up today and when I moved here to attend uni I practically lived on Berry Bonanza like three years. It helped me then and it\u2019s gonna help me now. I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t care about it, but in case you do, just know that this box and these sort of disgusting cereals mean the world to me.\u201d</p><p>The guy looked like he considered what to say for a moment and then nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, it\u2019s just cereals. Maybe I can find some other place that sells them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think this it\u2019s too late for that,\u201d Arya said, feeling suddenly apologetic.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWell, what can you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you probably grew up eating these, so you have had your fair share. We didn\u2019t have these up North.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he admitted, and for the first time, his face softened. \u201cMy mom bought them for me for a special treat. Nothing really makes you feel like five years old with no cares in the world than drinking that purple leftover milk from the bowl.\u201d There was a hint of a smile on his lips. \u201cHe used to\u2026 call me his little bullhead.\u201d A shade of pink flushed his cheeks after that and he clearly regretted saying that last part.</p><p>Arya hummed, cracked a smile for him. He was really cute. \u201cI guess you just have to go visit your mom and hope that she has some in her cupboards.\u201d</p><p>His eyes dropped from hers and he shrugged again. \u201cShe died when I was seven so probably not.\u201d</p><p>Arya\u2019s face sank and the hand holding the box relaxed to hang limp against her side. He didn\u2019t look like he was making it up or even saying things just to appeal her emotions. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you just played the dead mom card.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that, I just -</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Aya sighed, glanced the garish purple box and then handed it towards him. \u201cJust take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake it before I change my mind. I\u2019m not gonna take cereals from someone who bought them because of their dead mom. I\u2019m not a monster.\u201d He didn\u2019t move, just looked at her, so finally, Arya shook her hand and the box rattled. He reached to take it from her. \u201cEnjoy,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Arya looked at the box in his big hands. \u201cI\u2019m gonna miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was clearly talking to the box,\u201d Arya said when he looked so awkward suddenly. \u201cI mean I was looking at it. You better take good care of it.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, but the corners of his lips were tugging up.</p><p>Arya didn\u2019t know what to say anymore, there wasn\u2019t much to say. They had met. They had fought over cereals and almost got arrested. Now they parted their ways. She made weird twitch with her shoulders when waving felt too much and turned to leave.</p><p>\u201cI live a few blocks away.\u201d</p><p>Arya turned back to face him.</p><p>\u201cAnd I have milk.\u201d He looked surly again, but differently than before, like he didn\u2019t quite know what to do and it was annoying him. \u201cYou wanna grab a\u2026 bowl?\u201d</p><p>Arya hadn\u2019t looked the time, but it was already dark and she was standing in the street, in front of the police station and a hot stranger she had had a brawl with was inviting her to a bowl of cereals. It was not the way she had thought to spend her night. \u201cDon\u2019t you have any friends to spend time with?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you don\u2019t. You have no mom and no friends. How\u2019s your dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever met him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really walked into that one, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>He snorted, his smile was baring his teeth. Arya shook her head, trying not to smile herself.</p><p>\u201cWell lead the way, I guess,\u201d she said, moving towards him, her mind made. She would now have to be his friend. He had no other and he had her favorite cereals already. They started walking further down the street. \u201cI\u2019m Arya. Do you have a name, sad boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGendry. And I\u2019m not sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, it\u2019s like you were built in a sad-angry-hot-boy-factory. Here, let me help and carry those.\u201d Her hand reached toward the box, almost grabbing it while he looked surprised she had accidentally let slip out the fact that she thought he was hot. But Arya couldn\u2019t imagine he wouldn\u2019t already know it, surely there had been girls telling him that before. At the last moment, he managed to gather himself and pull the box away from her reach.</p><p>\u201cNice try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to steal them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t. And I can\u2019t, because technically they are mine. I bought them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith a dick move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd real money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis should be considered a tie because I bought the milk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt the milk cost ten dragons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither did the cereals. Paying that much was your own choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the only bill I had! I\u2019m just lucky I didn\u2019t end up paying more.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, looked at her in a weirdly soft way Arya wasn\u2019t sure anyone had ever looked at her before. She could just feel how she would end up work tomorrow wearing what she was wearing right now, having Berry Bonanza for breakfast, and probably a hickey on her neck.</p>",

He was probably a head taller than Arya, who had stayed the same humble size since thirteen. </p><p>She had merely opened her mouth when he had already grabbed the purple cereal box, destined to be hers, and walking away.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; Arya was surprised she reacted so fast and even more so that the tall stranger stopped. He turned, frowning, slightly moving his headphones from one of his ears. &ldquo;Those are my cereals.&rdquo;</p><p>The guy looked confused. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My cereals,&rdquo; Arya repeated and pointed the purple box. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s mine, I was just grabbing it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well grab another.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t another, it was the last one.&rdquo;</p><p>The guy shrugged, moved his headphones back on and turned away.</p><p>Arya could&rsquo;ve left it. She could&rsquo;ve. Easily. Just let the guy leave, pick another sugary cereal from the shelf. It would&rsquo;ve been easy.</p><p>But she had already decided she was destined to get the Berry Bonanza, and he was being kind of rude. She took a few quick running steps, twisted herself in his way at the narrow aisle. He grunted when he had to make such a sudden stop, and yanked his headphones down, to dangle on his neck.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your problem?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my cereals,&rdquo; Arya said between her teeth. &ldquo;Pick some other brand. I want the Berry Bonanza.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you five or something?&rdquo; The guy asked, raking his black mop of a hair, looking frustrated. &ldquo;I grabbed it, it&rsquo;s my box.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was reaching it first, you just grabbed it in front of my nose while I was asking could you hand it to me because I couldn&rsquo;t reach it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Listen, lady, I don&rsquo;t know what your deal is but I took the box from the self fair and square. So could you please step away from my way?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a lady.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really care to be honest.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya gritted her teeth, her hands balled into fists. She wanted that cereal box and she was ready to fight for it if it came to that. But then he was sort of huge and looked super stubborn, so quickly she changed her strategy, she was nothing if not adaptable.</p><p>&ldquo;Listen, I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Arya sighed. &ldquo;I am just having a bad day and Boo Boo Bull&rsquo;s Berry Bonanza is sort of comfort food for me.&rdquo;</p><p>The guy made the kind of small hmph that indicated that he understood her.</p><p>&ldquo;Could you maybe find it in your heart to let me have this one,&rdquo; she asked, making a slightly awkward little smile, played innocent and fragile like she was a baby bird.</p><p>The guy frowned slightly deeper, Arya could see him starting to crack. He glanced the box and Arya made a slightly sad face.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just a dainty girl. I need the sustenance,&rdquo; she muttered and tried her hardest to look like maybe she would wither away if she wouldn&rsquo;t eat pink and purple cereals right now.</p><p>His face tensed up immediately. &ldquo;There is nothing dainty about you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You look like you probably start bar fights,&rdquo; the guy accused. &ldquo;Like you probably have a knife in your bag.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya eyed her gym bag in which she definitely had the switchblade Jon had given her. &ldquo;Well, what if I have? I still want my Berry Bonanza.&rdquo; She tried to grab the box. The guy pulled it away and tried to swat her further like she was a fly.</p><p>&ldquo;You are really a pain in the arse, has anybody ever told you that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All the time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Get out my way!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Give me my Boo Boo!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What you are gonna do, fight for it?&rdquo;</p><p>***</p><p>The day had been long and frustrating. Gendry leaned his head against the grey tile wall behind him. He had just wanted some comfort and sugar into his system. It was going to be just a quick trip to the corner store to grab his cereals and head out. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe I got arrested because of cereals,&rdquo; he muttered.</p><p>The girl sitting a few chairs away, on the same hard plastic chairs snorted. &ldquo;No one&rsquo;s arrested, you&rsquo;re exaggerating.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well we are at the police station,&rdquo; Gendry pointed out the obvious. &ldquo;And the shop owner is still trying to decide if he&rsquo;s going to sue, so it&rsquo;s not really exaggerating.&rdquo; He peered at the girl, her arms were crossed and she was scowling him back. She was annoying. And insanely cute with her big grey eyes and perky ponytail, soft pink pursed lips, looking healthy like she had just left the gym. Her hair looked still slightly damp from the shower. She probably smelled really nice if he would lean in closer. He wasn&rsquo;t going to, though, she had almost gotten him arrested. And now her cuteness was distracting him from her annoyingness.</p><p>&ldquo;He is not gonna sue,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like anything even happened. Though if he for some reason is going to sue, that&rsquo;s going to be on you, because you were the one who knocked down the flat of pasta sauce.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because you basically tackled me!&rdquo;</p><p>She just huffed. &ldquo;I barely touched you. A slight shove. <i>A slight.</i>&rdquo;</p><p>Gendry shook his head and turned away from her. He couldn&rsquo;t believe that he was at the police station because of that stupid box of cereals.</p><p>The younger of the two officers that had arrived at the shop was approaching them. Gendry was happy it wasn&rsquo;t the tall blonde. She had been scary. He in the other hand seemed relaxed and the kind of person who would understand that sometimes even good people were pulled into weird situations, because of other, smaller and crazier people. Gendry straightened his back.</p><p>&ldquo;The owner has decided not to press charges,&rdquo; the officer said.</p><p>Gendry sighed. He glanced at the girl, who was peering him back again, looked like she wanted to say<i> I told you so</i>, but also secretly relieved. &ldquo;But you need to pay for the damage you caused -&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;- and you are both apparently barred for the shop.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fair enough.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s an overreaction.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please shut up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then there is this,&rdquo; the officer said and lifted the nearly neon purple Boo Boo Bull&rsquo;s Berry Bonanza box.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mine,&rdquo; she said quickly. </p><p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not,&rdquo; Gendry claimed.</p><p>&ldquo;I bought it.&rdquo;</p><p>Gendry scowled at her when she reached her hand and the officer handed the cereal box to her. She looked cute even while incredibly smug.</p><p>&ldquo;Please get out of here,&rdquo; the officer sighed.</p><p>***</p><p>Arya marched out of the police station, keeping her pace brisk, cradling her cereal box against her chest like an artificial berry flavored child.</p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t buy it,&rdquo; he said as soon as he entered behind her, and Arya spun to face him, then turned quickly back into walking.</p><p>&ldquo;Pretty sure I did.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You grabbed it from me when they were already escorting us out, threw a tenner to the cashier and shouted keep the change,&rdquo; He squinted at her with his eyes narrowed to thin lines. &ldquo;It was a dick move.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya jiggled her cereal box. &ldquo;It worked.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Still a dick move.&rdquo;</p><p>She stopped and sighed. He looked still so surly, and Arya felt sort of guilty for all the trouble they had gone through because of the box of cereals. &ldquo;Listen, I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I know I said it before, but that was clearly an act. But now I&rsquo;m being serious. I&rsquo;m sorry that all this happened. And I&rsquo;m sure you think I&rsquo;m a crazy person. But I&rsquo;m not, I&rsquo;m quite nice actually.&rdquo; His brow cocked up like he was doubting her. &ldquo;But I really needed some pick me up today and when I moved here to attend uni I practically lived on Berry Bonanza like three years. It helped me then and it&rsquo;s gonna help me now. I&rsquo;m sure you don&rsquo;t care about it, but in case you do, just know that this box and these sort of disgusting cereals mean the world to me.&rdquo;</p><p>The guy looked like he considered what to say for a moment and then nodded. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, it&rsquo;s just cereals. Maybe I can find some other place that sells them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think this it&rsquo;s too late for that,&rdquo; Arya said, feeling suddenly apologetic.</p><p>He shrugged. &ldquo;Well, what can you do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And you probably grew up eating these, so you have had your fair share. We didn&rsquo;t have these up North.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he admitted, and for the first time, his face softened. &ldquo;My mom bought them for me for a special treat. Nothing really makes you feel like five years old with no cares in the world than drinking that purple leftover milk from the bowl.&rdquo; There was a hint of a smile on his lips. &ldquo;He used to&hellip; call me his little bullhead.&rdquo; A shade of pink flushed his cheeks after that and he clearly regretted saying that last part.</p><p>Arya hummed, cracked a smile for him. He was really cute. &ldquo;I guess you just have to go visit your mom and hope that she has some in her cupboards.&rdquo;</p><p>His eyes dropped from hers and he shrugged again. &ldquo;She died when I was seven so probably not.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya&rsquo;s face sank and the hand holding the box relaxed to hang limp against her side. He didn&rsquo;t look like he was making it up or even saying things just to appeal her emotions. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you just played the dead mom card.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean it like that, I just -</p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; Aya sighed, glanced the garish purple box and then handed it towards him. &ldquo;Just take it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Take it before I change my mind. I&rsquo;m not gonna take cereals from someone who bought them because of their dead mom. I&rsquo;m not a monster.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t move, just looked at her, so finally, Arya shook her hand and the box rattled. He reached to take it from her. &ldquo;Enjoy,&rdquo; she muttered.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya looked at the box in his big hands. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna miss you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, well&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was clearly talking to the box,&rdquo; Arya said when he looked so awkward suddenly. &ldquo;I mean I was looking at it. You better take good care of it.&rdquo;</p><p>He shook his head, but the corners of his lips were tugging up.</p><p>Arya didn&rsquo;t know what to say anymore, there wasn&rsquo;t much to say. They had met. They had fought over cereals and almost got arrested. Now they parted their ways. She made weird twitch with her shoulders when waving felt too much and turned to leave.</p><p>&ldquo;I live a few blocks away.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya turned back to face him.</p><p>&ldquo;And I have milk.&rdquo; He looked surly again, but differently than before, like he didn&rsquo;t quite know what to do and it was annoying him. &ldquo;You wanna grab a&hellip; bowl?&rdquo;</p><p>Arya hadn&rsquo;t looked the time, but it was already dark and she was standing in the street, in front of the police station and a hot stranger she had had a brawl with was inviting her to a bowl of cereals. It was not the way she had thought to spend her night. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you have any friends to spend time with?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;no.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course you don&rsquo;t. You have no mom and no friends. How&rsquo;s your dad?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Never met him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I really walked into that one, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p><p>He snorted, his smile was baring his teeth. Arya shook her head, trying not to smile herself.</p><p>&ldquo;Well lead the way, I guess,&rdquo; she said, moving towards him, her mind made. She would now have to be his friend. He had no other and he had her favorite cereals already. They started walking further down the street. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Arya. Do you have a name, sad boy?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Gendry. And I&rsquo;m not sad.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please, it&rsquo;s like you were built in a sad-angry-hot-boy-factory. Here, let me help and carry those.&rdquo; Her hand reached toward the box, almost grabbing it while he looked surprised she had accidentally let slip out the fact that she thought he was hot. But Arya couldn&rsquo;t imagine he wouldn&rsquo;t already know it, surely there had been girls telling him that before. At the last moment, he managed to gather himself and pull the box away from her reach.</p><p>&ldquo;Nice try.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t going to steal them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t. And I can&rsquo;t, because technically they are mine. I bought them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;With a dick move.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And real money.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This should be considered a tie because I bought the milk.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I doubt the milk cost ten dragons.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Neither did the cereals. Paying that much was your own choice.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was the only bill I had! I&rsquo;m just lucky I didn&rsquo;t end up paying more.&rdquo;</p><p>He laughed, looked at her in a weirdly soft way Arya wasn&rsquo;t sure anyone had ever looked at her before. She could just feel how she would end up work tomorrow wearing what she was wearing right now, having Berry Bonanza for breakfast, and probably a hickey on her neck.</p>",

Arya entered the small corner store meaning to grab some frozen meal, but when even that seemed too much work - she was no mood for poking plastic and waiting for the microwave to do its thing - she headed for the cereals. She discarded anything that looked too healthy for her, that was not what she wanted. She wanted E-colours and sugar. And when she saw the garish and yet comforting shade of nearly neon purple that was the box of Boo Boo Bull&rsquo;s Berry Bonanza on the top shelf her mind was made. And as there was only one box of it, it felt like destiny.</p>\n<p>Arya reached for the box, rose to her tiptoes and stretched her hand, fingers nearly brushing the colorful cardboard, but not quite. She huffed and flopped her hands down, quickly glancing was there a stepladder or crate or anything really she could stand on and grab her pink and purple cereal treat. There was nothing that wasn&rsquo;t made out of flimsy cardboard, and she hated to go ask for help. She reached again, cursing to whoever had though shelves this tall would be a good idea. Probably some smug tall person who had no idea how frustrating not reaching something was.</p>\n<p>Her toes were hurting and Arya had to give up. She made a low and quiet grunt before facing up the fact that she needed to find someone taller to help her. She was already leaving to find someone when a guy appeared from behind the tall piles of soda crates, seemingly suddenly, almost stopping next to him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He looked sturdy and surly, in a quite interesting and hot way. Black unruly hair and bright blue eyes, wearing jeans and grey t-shirt, and one of those big headphones people who took listening music seriously, or pretending to be someone who wants to look like they were taking listening music seriously, had. And he was definitely tall enough to reach the top shelf. He was probably a head taller than Arya, who had stayed the same humble size since thirteen. </p>\n<p>She had merely opened her mouth when he had already grabbed the purple cereal box, destined to be hers, and walking away.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; Arya was surprised she reacted so fast and even more so that the tall stranger stopped. He turned, frowning, slightly moving his headphones from one of his ears. &ldquo;Those are my cereals.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The guy looked confused. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;My cereals,&rdquo; Arya repeated and pointed the purple box. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s mine, I was just grabbing it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Well grab another.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t another, it was the last one.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The guy shrugged, moved his headphones back on and turned away.</p>\n<p>Arya could&rsquo;ve left it. She could&rsquo;ve. Easily. Just let the guy leave, pick another sugary cereal from the shelf. It would&rsquo;ve been easy.</p>\n</p>",
