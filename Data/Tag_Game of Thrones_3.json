His redemption wouldn&rsquo;t have been living out his days with a big fat glorious label of &ldquo;honourable&rdquo; slapped on him. He killed and betrayed and fought for Cersei, and at the same time he was always helping Tyrion escape and so on. We&rsquo;ve always thought he was good when he was protecting Tyrion and evil when he was protecting Cersei and her interests. If we think about it, from a complete outsider&rsquo;s point of view both sets of actions are selfish and backward but the real common denominator is exactly as above, family.\u00a0</p><p>It&rsquo;s not a coincidence in the last episode that Tyrion tells him to escape like Jaime had tried to do for him. Even after everything, Tyrion has ended up back at Kings Landing anyway and he&rsquo;s now prepared to face any punishment Daenerys sets on him. This is the same with Jaime, he&rsquo;s come full circle\u2014 he&rsquo;s facing his crimes. We might ask why he&rsquo;s protecting Cersei at a moment like this. But that&rsquo;s just it. He has always seen the bad in her, and he has a tumultuous relationship with that. Way back when, people expected him to go on protecting Aerys even when he was going mad, but now that he&rsquo;s protecting Cersei we think he&rsquo;s mad. It&rsquo;s the same on paper\u2014 he&rsquo;s keeping his promise to protect and love someone no matter what they&rsquo;ve done. He&rsquo;s done it at the &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; moment in history, and people can only know him as a traitor, but this just questions what being a knight really means. And that&rsquo;s what Jaime Lannister has always been about.We want him to kill Cersei or whatever but that&rsquo;s because we want him to be the songs-and-tales good knight. It&rsquo;s because he was on the way to becoming one. But how it&rsquo;s ended with him now is Jaime as an actual &ldquo;good&rdquo; knight, that is, someone who continuously makes choices based on loyalty. They showed us with Ned Stark that it can be stupid. They showed us with Brienne it can be good but complicated\u2014 she was accused of killing Renly, she was seen for being a Lannister sympathiser, etc etc. And now they&rsquo;ve showed us with Jaime that it&rsquo;s rarely ever simple.\u00a0</p><p>The way they wrote his scenes with Cersei were fine. But I think the crux of the misunderstanding is when he said he never cared about the people in Kings Landing anyway. I think that should have been a bigger moment so that all of this about Jaime really came to light for the audience, and the key point, that most importantly he would never kill Tywin no matter what, would have come through. He died completely on his own terms and of his own choices. RIP.\ufeff<br/></p>",
