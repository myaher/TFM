The end of the day had come, and you were ready to get home. You headed out of your art classroom and towards your locker to dump off some of your books.\u00a0</p><p>Your locker was right next to Peter Parker\u2019s. You didn\u2019t really know much about him, except that he was really nice and crazy smart. You had made small talk almost every day, and you were always friendly with each other, but you weren\u2019t quite friends yet.\u00a0</p><p>Oh but how you wished you were.\u00a0</p><p>He was so. Damn. Cute.\u00a0</p><p>You didn\u2019t know if he felt the same way, but you had had a crush on him since 7th grade. He was so sweet and shy and his hair was perfect. I mean, like, how-the-hell-is-it-so-gorgeous perfect.\u00a0</p><p>You knew he couldn\u2019t be your soulmate, though. His stain was on the palm of his right hand, while yours was around your ankle. There was no way the first time you two touched would be him grabbing your ankle. It made you somewhat disappointed, but you dreamt about being with him anyway.\u00a0</p><p>As you were putting your books away, he came up next to you and fiddled with the padlock on his locker.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey, Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, (Y/n).\u201d He gave you a big grin. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cGreat, thanks. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame old, I guess.\u201d</p><p>That was usually the extent of your conversations. Every once in a while he would say, \u201cNed is coming over to build LEGOs tonight,\u201d or you would say, \u201cMy mom said we could order Chinese takeout tonight,\u201d but you never had any \u201creal\u201d conversations.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey, c-can I ask a favor?\u201d he inquired suddenly.</p><p>\u201cSure!\u201d you answered, your heartbeat picking up speed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNed has a dentist appointment during chemistry tomorrow,\u201d he said, rubbing the back of his neck. \u201cWould you be my lab partner?\u201d</p><p>You couldn\u2019t help but smile. He was so cute and awkward.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to!\u201d you said happily.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d he asked. \u201cAwesome! Thanks so much!\u201d</p><p>He closed his locker. \u201cSee you tomorrow!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee ya!\u201d you replied, waving as he walked away. When you were sure no one could see, you pumped your fist. You guys were going to officially hang out. Progress, right?</p><p>You closed your locker and started to head home. You put your earbuds in to drown out the sounds of New York. The road you normally walked down to get back to your apartment was closed for construction, so you took some back alleys instead. You were completely oblivious to everything.\u00a0</p><p>Even the man following you.\u00a0</p><p>You took a couple more turns when you felt someone grab your shoulder and spin you around. The man was wearing a ski mask and had a knife pointed at your abdomen.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGimme the bag!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You dropped your backpack immediately. He grabbed it and began to rifle through it. You slowly tried to inch away.\u00a0</p><p>He shot back up and stuck the knife out.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move!\u201d he barked.\u00a0</p><p>You put your hands up in surrender and he went back to the bag. Upon finding nothing of value, you assumed he would run away. Instead he grabbed your upper arm and pulled you down the alley.\u00a0</p><p>You struggled to pull away from him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLet me go!\u201d</p><p>His grip only tightened.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHELP!\u201d you screamed.\u00a0</p><p>He put the knife up to your throat.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cStay quiet!\u201d he ordered.\u00a0</p><p>The two of you emerged from the alley. He kept the knife in his sleeve, still poking it against your gut. You made your way towards the river to cross the bridge.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not gonna make a sound, or I\u2019m gonna kill you right here, you understand?\u201d</p><p>You nodded.\u00a0</p><p>You were halfway across the bridge when you saw something red and blue dart across the sky.\u00a0</p><p>Spider-Man.</p><p>No doubt he saw you were in trouble. He had those weird spider-senses, right? <br/>You could see him perched on top of the bridge. Your captor had not taken notice. You looked up, trying your best to convey that you were in trouble with just your eyes.</p><p>You saw him raise his hand as if aiming at the man with the knife. A web shot out of his wrist.\u00a0</p><p>You pushed away at the last second, but the force you exerted just barely got your captor out of the way of the web.\u00a0</p><p>The man saw the web hit the edge of the bridge and looked up. He then turned towards you and grabbed you, lifting you above his shoulders.\u00a0</p><p>You squirmed as much as you could, but you couldn\u2019t get away.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHEY! Spider-Man!\u201d the man yelled. \u201cCatch!\u201d</p><p>The man turned towards the river and threw you over the edge.\u00a0</p><p>You screamed, but you couldn\u2019t hear yourself over the wind, whipping your hair around like a tornado. You were spinning in the air and you couldn\u2019t make anything out and you were about to hit the water.</p><p>Suddenly someone grabbed your ankle. You looked up to see Spider-Man himself dangling from a web off the bridge, holding on as tight as he could.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked. His voice sounded familiar.\u00a0</p><p>You nodded. It was all you could do. You were almost completely out of breath. <br/>He pulled the two of you back to the bridge where a crowd had gathered. They all clapped upon seeing you were okay.\u00a0</p><p>Spider-Man set you down.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d he asked, his voice gruffer than before, as if he were trying to disguise it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d you panted, leaning forward and putting your hands on your knees. \u201cThank you, I owe you my life!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll in a day\u2019s work, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said. \u201cThe police are on their way, stay here until they come, alright?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You nodded and thanked him again. He waved and then was gone, swinging downtown.\u00a0</p><p>The police arrived just after he had left. One of the officers came up to you to make sure you were okay and said she would stay with you until your parents came to the scene.\u00a0</p><p>Your dad drove to the scene, arriving about fifteen minutes after the police. He wrapped you up in a huge hug, almost looking like he was about to cry.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou okay kiddo?\u201d he asked, pushing hair out of your face.\u00a0</p><p>You nodded.\u00a0</p><p>He hugged you again. \u201cLet\u2019s get you home, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>As soon as you got home your mom almost tackled you, crying and smoothing your hair. You assured her you were fine. You were exhausted and just wanted to take a warm shower to relax your nerves.\u00a0</p><p>You went in your room, sat on your bed, and leaned down to untie your shoes. You took them and your socks off when you noticed something on your ankle.\u00a0</p><p>A spot of color.\u00a0</p><p>You pulled your pant leg to reveal that the black stain that wrapped around your ankle was now rainbow.\u00a0</p><p><i>Who the hell grabbed my ankle?</i></p><p>You sat up.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMOM! DAD!\u201d You ran back into the living room. \u201cSPIDER-MAN IS MY SOULMATE!\u201d</p><p>Your mom ran in from the kitchen and your dad came from his office. Their eyes went wide when they saw the colors wrapped around your ankle.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that was Spider-Man?\u201d asked your dad, not taking his eyes off of the rainbow on your skin.</p><p>\u201cNo one else has grabbed my ankle,\u201d you said excitedly. \u201cAnd who would, except for the guy who saved me from falling off of a bridge by pulling me by the ankle?\u201d</p><p>Your parents exchanged a look.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t he a little old for you?\u201d you mom asked skeptically.</p><p>\u201cNo one knows how old he is,\u201d you said. \u201cHis voice sounded like he could be a teenager though. It actually sounded familiar, so maybe he goes to my school!\u201d</p><p>Your dad chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m just surprised you found your soulmate this early. It took me until after college to finally find your mom.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him, then looked back at you. \u201cGuess you\u2019re gonna have to find out who Spider-Man is, huh?\u201d</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>It was a daunting task. No one knew anything about Spider-Man. Ned once told everyone that Peter knew him, but no one believed him. You decided it\u2019d be worth a shot to ask about it. There was no harm in it.</p><p>When you got to your locker the next morning, Peter was nowhere to be seen. It was okay, you\u2019d definitely see him in chemistry.</p><p>\u201cHey Peter!\u201d</p><p>He turned. \u201cHey, (Y/n), guess what?\u201d</p><p>He held his hand up. His palm was no longer black.</p><p>He had found his soulmate, too.</p><p>Your heart fell a bit. You already knew the two of you weren\u2019t meant for each other, but it still hurt a little.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWho was it?\u201d you asked, trying not to show any disappointment.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea,\u201d he answered. Seeing your surprised face, he continued, \u201cI was wearing\u2026 um&hellip; gloves when it happened, so it could have been anybody. I\u2019m really stumped.\u201d</p><p>You pulled your pant leg up to show him your ankle. \u201cI found mine yesterday, too, but guess who it is?\u201d</p><p>He just stared blankly.</p><p>\u201cSpider-Man!\u201d</p><p>His face went red immediately. \u201cHow, um, h-how do you know?\u201d he asked quickly.</p><p>\u201cLong story, but I got thrown off of a bridge yesterday on my way home and he saved me and he grabbed me by my ankle! I just need to figure out who he is. Ned told everyone you knew him, is that true?\u201d</p><p>His face just got redder. You opened your mouth to ask if he was okay when your chemistry teacher began talking about the experiment you were going to do. Peter faced towards the front of the class, still blushing.</p><p>You tried to talk to him throughout class after your teacher was finished talking, but he became very quiet. He would only talk about the experiment, but even when he did, his comments were short and barely audible. You felt bad; maybe he didn\u2019t actually know Spider-Man and you had embarrassed him?</p><p>You were still wondering what had gone wrong while you were hanging your apron on one of the hooks on the wall. Peter came up to you, fidgeting with his fingers.</p><p>\u201cCan I talk to you privately?\u201d he asked in a voice just above a whisper.</p><p>You nodded, and he led you into the hall, outside, and to an alley behind the school. Being in an alley again made you a bit nervous, but maybe if someone attacked you two, Spider-Man could come and you could talk about being soulmates.</p><p>Peter took a deep breath. \u201cI need you to keep a secret, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay\u2026 I can do that. Are you alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Spider-Man.\u201d</p><p>You squinted your eyes skeptically. \u201cAre you messing with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not messing with you!\u201d</p><p>You still weren\u2019t sure. \u201cProve it.\u201d</p><p>Peter put his bag on the ground and zipped it open, pulling a bundle of red and blue clothes out. He held it up so that you could see it was a Spider-Man suit.<br/>\u201cI was sitting on top of the bridge when you first saw me,\u201d he said. \u201cI shot a web and you pushed away from that guy, and when he saw the web he threw you over. I webbed him to the ground and jumped after you and I grabbed you by your ankle.</p><p>You were in shock. <i>Holy shit, Peter Parker is Spider-Man.</i></p><p>\u201cSo\u2026 you saved my life,\u201d you began, \u201cand\u2026 and we\u2019re\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoulmates,\u201d Peter finished.</p><p>You were ecstatic. You jumped as high as you could, punching your fists in the air. He chuckled.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay with that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOkay?! I\u2019ve had a crush on you since freaking middle school!\u201d You wrapped your arms around his neck, pulling him into a tight hug which he was quick to reciprocate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had a bit of a crush on you, too,\u201d he confessed in your ear.</p><p>Your heart skipped.\u00a0</p><p>Suddenly he pulled away, put his hands on your cheeks, and kissed you. You melted into it immediately, pushing your hands through his perfect hair.</p><p>\u201cI love you, (Y/n).\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, Peter.\u201d</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>The next few days, everyone was talking about how the two of you were soulmates. You were still able to keep Peter\u2019s secret identity, well, secret, even though people were constantly wondering how the hell you two ended up in a situation where he was grabbing your ankle.\u00a0</p><p>You and Peter met up at your lockers every morning and every afternoon when school ended. Sometimes you would build LEGOS with him and Ned. Sometimes he would come to your apartment and eat Chinese takeout. You texted each other every day when you woke up and every night when you went to sleep, and he always let you know he was safe after a patrol.</p><p>You were happy together, and you stayed that way for the rest of your lives.<br/></p>",

The end of the day had come, and you were ready to get home.

You didn\u2019t really know much about him, except that he was really nice and crazy smart. You had made small talk almost every day, and you were always friendly with each other, but you weren\u2019t quite friends yet.\u00a0</p><p>Oh but how you wished you were.\u00a0</p><p>He was so.

You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame old, I guess.\u201d</p><p>That was usually the extent of your conversations. Every once in a while he would say, \u201cNed is coming over to build LEGOs tonight,\u201d or you would say, \u201cMy mom said we could order Chinese takeout tonight,\u201d but you never had any \u201creal\u201d conversations.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey, c-can I ask a favor?\u201d he inquired suddenly.</p><p>\u201cSure!\u201d you answered, your heartbeat picking up speed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNed has a dentist appointment during chemistry tomorrow,\u201d he said, rubbing the back of his neck. \u201cWould you be my lab partner?\u201d</p><p>You couldn\u2019t help but smile. He was so cute and awkward.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to!\u201d you said happily.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d he asked. \u201cAwesome! Thanks so much!\u201d</p><p>He closed his locker. \u201cSee you tomorrow!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee ya!\u201d you replied, waving as he walked away. When you were sure no one could see, you pumped your fist. You guys were going to officially hang out. Progress, right?</p><p>You closed your locker and started to head home. You put your earbuds in to drown out the sounds of New York. The road you normally walked down to get back to your apartment was closed for construction, so you took some back alleys instead. You were completely oblivious to everything.\u00a0</p><p>Even the man following you.\u00a0</p><p>You took a couple more turns when you felt someone grab your shoulder and spin you around. The man was wearing a ski mask and had a knife pointed at your abdomen.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGimme the bag!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You dropped your backpack immediately. He grabbed it and began to rifle through it. You slowly tried to inch away.\u00a0</p><p>He shot back up and stuck the knife out.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move!\u201d he barked.\u00a0</p><p>You put your hands up in surrender and he went back to the bag. Upon finding nothing of value, you assumed he would run away. Instead he grabbed your upper arm and pulled you down the alley.\u00a0</p><p>You struggled to pull away from him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLet me go!\u201d</p><p>His grip only tightened.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHELP!\u201d you screamed.\u00a0</p><p>He put the knife up to your throat.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cStay quiet!\u201d he ordered.\u00a0</p><p>The two of you emerged from the alley. He kept the knife in his sleeve, still poking it against your gut. You made your way towards the river to cross the bridge.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not gonna make a sound, or I\u2019m gonna kill you right here, you understand?\u201d</p><p>You nodded.\u00a0</p><p>You were halfway across the bridge when you saw something red and blue dart across the sky.\u00a0</p><p>Spider-Man.</p><p>No doubt he saw you were in trouble. He had those weird spider-senses, right? <br>You could see him perched on top of the bridge. Your captor had not taken notice. You looked up, trying your best to convey that you were in trouble with just your eyes.</p><p>You saw him raise his hand as if aiming at the man with the knife. A web shot out of his wrist.\u00a0</p><p>You pushed away at the last second, but the force you exerted just barely got your captor out of the way of the web.\u00a0</p><p>The man saw the web hit the edge of the bridge and looked up. He then turned towards you and grabbed you, lifting you above his shoulders.\u00a0</p><p>You squirmed as much as you could, but you couldn\u2019t get away.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHEY! Spider-Man!\u201d the man yelled. \u201cCatch!\u201d</p><p>The man turned towards the river and threw you over the edge.\u00a0</p><p>You screamed, but you couldn\u2019t hear yourself over the wind, whipping your hair around like a tornado. You were spinning in the air and you couldn\u2019t make anything out and you were about to hit the water.</p><p>Suddenly someone grabbed your ankle. You looked up to see Spider-Man himself dangling from a web off the bridge, holding on as tight as he could.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked. His voice sounded familiar.\u00a0</p><p>You nodded. It was all you could do. You were almost completely out of breath. <br>He pulled the two of you back to the bridge where a crowd had gathered. They all clapped upon seeing you were okay.\u00a0</p><p>Spider-Man set you down.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d he asked, his voice gruffer than before, as if he were trying to disguise it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d you panted, leaning forward and putting your hands on your knees. \u201cThank you, I owe you my life!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll in a day\u2019s work, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said. \u201cThe police are on their way, stay here until they come, alright?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You nodded and thanked him again. He waved and then was gone, swinging downtown.\u00a0</p><p>The police arrived just after he had left. One of the officers came up to you to make sure you were okay and said she would stay with you until your parents came to the scene.\u00a0</p><p>Your dad drove to the scene, arriving about fifteen minutes after the police. He wrapped you up in a huge hug, almost looking like he was about to cry.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou okay kiddo?\u201d he asked, pushing hair out of your face.\u00a0</p><p>You nodded.\u00a0</p><p>He hugged you again. \u201cLet\u2019s get you home, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>As soon as you got home your mom almost tackled you, crying and smoothing your hair. You assured her you were fine. You were exhausted and just wanted to take a warm shower to relax your nerves.\u00a0</p><p>You went in your room, sat on your bed, and leaned down to untie your shoes. You took them and your socks off when you noticed something on your ankle.\u00a0</p><p>A spot of color.\u00a0</p><p>You pulled your pant leg to reveal that the black stain that wrapped around your ankle was now rainbow.\u00a0</p><p><i>Who the hell grabbed my ankle?</i></p><p>You sat up.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMOM! DAD!\u201d You ran back into the living room. \u201cSPIDER-MAN IS MY SOULMATE!\u201d</p><p>Your mom ran in from the kitchen and your dad came from his office. Their eyes went wide when they saw the colors wrapped around your ankle.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that was Spider-Man?\u201d asked your dad, not taking his eyes off of the rainbow on your skin.</p><p>\u201cNo one else has grabbed my ankle,\u201d you said excitedly. \u201cAnd who would, except for the guy who saved me from falling off of a bridge by pulling me by the ankle?\u201d</p><p>Your parents exchanged a look.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t he a little old for you?\u201d you mom asked skeptically.</p><p>\u201cNo one knows how old he is,\u201d you said. \u201cHis voice sounded like he could be a teenager though. It actually sounded familiar, so maybe he goes to my school!\u201d</p><p>Your dad chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m just surprised you found your soulmate this early. It took me until after college to finally find your mom.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him, then looked back at you. \u201cGuess you\u2019re gonna have to find out who Spider-Man is, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><p>It was a daunting task. No one knew anything about Spider-Man. Ned once told everyone that Peter knew him, but no one believed him. You decided it\u2019d be worth a shot to ask about it. There was no harm in it.</p><p>When you got to your locker the next morning, Peter was nowhere to be seen. It was okay, you\u2019d definitely see him in chemistry.</p><p>\u201cHey Peter!\u201d</p><p>He turned. \u201cHey, (Y/n), guess what?\u201d</p><p>He held his hand up. His palm was no longer black.</p><p>He had found his soulmate, too.</p><p>Your heart fell a bit. You already knew the two of you weren\u2019t meant for each other, but it still hurt a little.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWho was it?\u201d you asked, trying not to show any disappointment.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea,\u201d he answered. Seeing your surprised face, he continued, \u201cI was wearing\u2026 um\u2026 gloves when it happened, so it could have been anybody. I\u2019m really stumped.\u201d</p><p>You pulled your pant leg up to show him your ankle. \u201cI found mine yesterday, too, but guess who it is?\u201d</p><p>He just stared blankly.</p><p>\u201cSpider-Man!\u201d</p><p>His face went red immediately. \u201cHow, um, h-how do you know?\u201d he asked quickly.</p><p>\u201cLong story, but I got thrown off of a bridge yesterday on my way home and he saved me and he grabbed me by my ankle! I just need to figure out who he is. Ned told everyone you knew him, is that true?\u201d</p><p>His face just got redder. You opened your mouth to ask if he was okay when your chemistry teacher began talking about the experiment you were going to do. Peter faced towards the front of the class, still blushing.</p><p>You tried to talk to him throughout class after your teacher was finished talking, but he became very quiet. He would only talk about the experiment, but even when he did, his comments were short and barely audible. You felt bad; maybe he didn\u2019t actually know Spider-Man and you had embarrassed him?</p><p>You were still wondering what had gone wrong while you were hanging your apron on one of the hooks on the wall. Peter came up to you, fidgeting with his fingers.</p><p>\u201cCan I talk to you privately?\u201d he asked in a voice just above a whisper.</p><p>You nodded, and he led you into the hall, outside, and to an alley behind the school. Being in an alley again made you a bit nervous, but maybe if someone attacked you two, Spider-Man could come and you could talk about being soulmates.</p><p>Peter took a deep breath. \u201cI need you to keep a secret, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay\u2026 I can do that. Are you alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Spider-Man.\u201d</p><p>You squinted your eyes skeptically. \u201cAre you messing with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not messing with you!\u201d</p><p>You still weren\u2019t sure. \u201cProve it.\u201d</p><p>Peter put his bag on the ground and zipped it open, pulling a bundle of red and blue clothes out. He held it up so that you could see it was a Spider-Man suit.<br>\u201cI was sitting on top of the bridge when you first saw me,\u201d he said. \u201cI shot a web and you pushed away from that guy, and when he saw the web he threw you over. I webbed him to the ground and jumped after you and I grabbed you by your ankle.</p><p>You were in shock. <i>Holy shit, Peter Parker is Spider-Man.</i></p><p>\u201cSo\u2026 you saved my life,\u201d you began, \u201cand\u2026 and we\u2019re\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoulmates,\u201d Peter finished.</p><p>You were ecstatic. You jumped as high as you could, punching your fists in the air. He chuckled.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay with that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOkay?! I\u2019ve had a crush on you since freaking middle school!\u201d You wrapped your arms around his neck, pulling him into a tight hug which he was quick to reciprocate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had a bit of a crush on you, too,\u201d he confessed in your ear.</p><p>Your heart skipped.\u00a0</p><p>Suddenly he pulled away, put his hands on your cheeks, and kissed you. You melted into it immediately, pushing your hands through his perfect hair.</p><p>\u201cI love you, (Y/n).\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><p>The next few days, everyone was talking about how the two of you were soulmates. You were still able to keep Peter\u2019s secret identity, well, secret, even though people were constantly wondering how the hell you two ended up in a situation where he was grabbing your ankle.\u00a0</p><p>You and Peter met up at your lockers every morning and every afternoon when school ended. Sometimes you would build LEGOS with him and Ned. Sometimes he would come to your apartment and eat Chinese takeout. You texted each other every day when you woke up and every night when you went to sleep, and he always let you know he was safe after a patrol.</p><p>You were happy together, and you stayed that way for the rest of your lives.<br></p>",

Instead he grabbed your upper arm and pulled you down the alley.\u00a0</p><p>You struggled to pull away from him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLet me go!\u201d</p><p>His grip only tightened.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHELP!\u201d you screamed.\u00a0</p><p>He put the knife up to your throat.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cStay quiet!\u201d he ordered.\u00a0</p><p>The two of you emerged from the alley. He kept the knife in his sleeve, still poking it against your gut. You made your way towards the river to cross the bridge.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not gonna make a sound, or I\u2019m gonna kill you right here, you understand?\u201d</p><p>You nodded.\u00a0</p><p>You were halfway across the bridge when you saw something red and blue dart across the sky.\u00a0</p><p>Spider-Man.</p><p>No doubt he saw you were in trouble. He had those weird spider-senses, right? <br>You could see him perched on top of the bridge. Your captor had not taken notice. You looked up, trying your best to convey that you were in trouble with just your eyes.</p><p>You saw him raise his hand as if aiming at the man with the knife. A web shot out of his wrist.\u00a0</p><p>You pushed away at the last second, but the force you exerted just barely got your captor out of the way of the web.\u00a0</p><p>The man saw the web hit the edge of the bridge and looked up. He then turned towards you and grabbed you, lifting you above his shoulders.\u00a0</p><p>You squirmed as much as you could, but you couldn\u2019t get away.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHEY! Spider-Man!\u201d the man yelled. \u201cCatch!\u201d</p><p>The man turned towards the river and threw you over the edge.\u00a0</p><p>You screamed, but you couldn\u2019t hear yourself over the wind, whipping your hair around like a tornado. You were spinning in the air and you couldn\u2019t make anything out and you were about to hit the water.</p><p>Suddenly someone grabbed your ankle. You looked up to see Spider-Man himself dangling from a web off the bridge, holding on as tight as he could.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked. His voice sounded familiar.\u00a0</p><p>You nodded. It was all you could do. You were almost completely out of breath. <br>He pulled the two of you back to the bridge where a crowd had gathered. They all clapped upon seeing you were okay.\u00a0</p><p>Spider-Man set you down.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d he asked, his voice gruffer than before, as if he were trying to disguise it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d you panted, leaning forward and putting your hands on your knees. \u201cThank you, I owe you my life!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll in a day\u2019s work, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said. \u201cThe police are on their way, stay here until they come, alright?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You nodded and thanked him again. He waved and then was gone, swinging downtown.\u00a0</p><p>The police arrived just after he had left. One of the officers came up to you to make sure you were okay and said she would stay with you until your parents came to the scene.\u00a0</p><p>Your dad drove to the scene, arriving about fifteen minutes after the police. He wrapped you up in a huge hug, almost looking like he was about to cry.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou okay kiddo?\u201d he asked, pushing hair out of your face.\u00a0</p><p>You nodded.\u00a0</p><p>He hugged you again. \u201cLet\u2019s get you home, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>As soon as you got home your mom almost tackled you, crying and smoothing your hair. You assured her you were fine. You were exhausted and just wanted to take a warm shower to relax your nerves.\u00a0</p><p>You went in your room, sat on your bed, and leaned down to untie your shoes. You took them and your socks off when you noticed something on your ankle.\u00a0</p><p>A spot of color.\u00a0</p><p>You pulled your pant leg to reveal that the black stain that wrapped around your ankle was now rainbow.\u00a0</p><p><i>Who the hell grabbed my ankle?</i></p><p>You sat up.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMOM! DAD!\u201d You ran back into the living room. \u201cSPIDER-MAN IS MY SOULMATE!\u201d</p><p>Your mom ran in from the kitchen and your dad came from his office. Their eyes went wide when they saw the colors wrapped around your ankle.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that was Spider-Man?\u201d asked your dad, not taking his eyes off of the rainbow on your skin.</p><p>\u201cNo one else has grabbed my ankle,\u201d you said excitedly. \u201cAnd who would, except for the guy who saved me from falling off of a bridge by pulling me by the ankle?\u201d</p><p>Your parents exchanged a look.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t he a little old for you?\u201d you mom asked skeptically.</p><p>\u201cNo one knows how old he is,\u201d you said. \u201cHis voice sounded like he could be a teenager though. It actually sounded familiar, so maybe he goes to my school!\u201d</p><p>Your dad chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m just surprised you found your soulmate this early. It took me until after college to finally find your mom.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him, then looked back at you. \u201cGuess you\u2019re gonna have to find out who Spider-Man is, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><p>It was a daunting task. No one knew anything about Spider-Man. Ned once told everyone that Peter knew him, but no one believed him. You decided it\u2019d be worth a shot to ask about it. There was no harm in it.</p><p>When you got to your locker the next morning, Peter was nowhere to be seen. It was okay, you\u2019d definitely see him in chemistry.</p><p>\u201cHey Peter!\u201d</p><p>He turned. \u201cHey, (Y/n), guess what?\u201d</p><p>He held his hand up. His palm was no longer black.</p><p>He had found his soulmate, too.</p><p>Your heart fell a bit. You already knew the two of you weren\u2019t meant for each other, but it still hurt a little.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWho was it?\u201d you asked, trying not to show any disappointment.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea,\u201d he answered. Seeing your surprised face, he continued, \u201cI was wearing\u2026 um\u2026 gloves when it happened, so it could have been anybody. I\u2019m really stumped.\u201d</p><p>You pulled your pant leg up to show him your ankle. \u201cI found mine yesterday, too, but guess who it is?\u201d</p><p>He just stared blankly.</p><p>\u201cSpider-Man!\u201d</p><p>His face went red immediately. \u201cHow, um, h-how do you know?\u201d he asked quickly.</p><p>\u201cLong story, but I got thrown off of a bridge yesterday on my way home and he saved me and he grabbed me by my ankle! I just need to figure out who he is. Ned told everyone you knew him, is that true?\u201d</p><p>His face just got redder. You opened your mouth to ask if he was okay when your chemistry teacher began talking about the experiment you were going to do. Peter faced towards the front of the class, still blushing.</p><p>You tried to talk to him throughout class after your teacher was finished talking, but he became very quiet. He would only talk about the experiment, but even when he did, his comments were short and barely audible. You felt bad; maybe he didn\u2019t actually know Spider-Man and you had embarrassed him?</p><p>You were still wondering what had gone wrong while you were hanging your apron on one of the hooks on the wall. Peter came up to you, fidgeting with his fingers.</p><p>\u201cCan I talk to you privately?\u201d he asked in a voice just above a whisper.</p><p>You nodded, and he led you into the hall, outside, and to an alley behind the school. Being in an alley again made you a bit nervous, but maybe if someone attacked you two, Spider-Man could come and you could talk about being soulmates.</p><p>Peter took a deep breath. \u201cI need you to keep a secret, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay\u2026 I can do that. Are you alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Spider-Man.\u201d</p><p>You squinted your eyes skeptically. \u201cAre you messing with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not messing with you!\u201d</p><p>You still weren\u2019t sure. \u201cProve it.\u201d</p><p>Peter put his bag on the ground and zipped it open, pulling a bundle of red and blue clothes out. He held it up so that you could see it was a Spider-Man suit.<br>\u201cI was sitting on top of the bridge when you first saw me,\u201d he said. \u201cI shot a web and you pushed away from that guy, and when he saw the web he threw you over. I webbed him to the ground and jumped after you and I grabbed you by your ankle.</p><p>You were in shock. <i>Holy shit, Peter Parker is Spider-Man.</i></p><p>\u201cSo\u2026 you saved my life,\u201d you began, \u201cand\u2026 and we\u2019re\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoulmates,\u201d Peter finished.</p><p>You were ecstatic. You jumped as high as you could, punching your fists in the air. He chuckled.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay with that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOkay?! I\u2019ve had a crush on you since freaking middle school!\u201d You wrapped your arms around his neck, pulling him into a tight hug which he was quick to reciprocate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had a bit of a crush on you, too,\u201d he confessed in your ear.</p><p>Your heart skipped.\u00a0</p><p>Suddenly he pulled away, put his hands on your cheeks, and kissed you. You melted into it immediately, pushing your hands through his perfect hair.</p><p>\u201cI love you, (Y/n).\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><p>The next few days, everyone was talking about how the two of you were soulmates. You were still able to keep Peter\u2019s secret identity, well, secret, even though people were constantly wondering how the hell you two ended up in a situation where he was grabbing your ankle.\u00a0</p><p>You and Peter met up at your lockers every morning and every afternoon when school ended. Sometimes you would build LEGOS with him and Ned. Sometimes he would come to your apartment and eat Chinese takeout. You texted each other every day when you woke up and every night when you went to sleep, and he always let you know he was safe after a patrol.</p><p>You were happy together, and you stayed that way for the rest of your lives.<br></p>",

The end of the day had come, and you were ready to get home. You headed out of your art classroom and towards your locker to dump off some of your books.&nbsp;</p><p>Your locker was right next to Peter Parker&rsquo;s. You didn&rsquo;t really know much about him, except that he was really nice and crazy smart. You had made small talk almost every day, and you were always friendly with each other, but you weren&rsquo;t quite friends yet.&nbsp;</p><p>Oh but how you wished you were.&nbsp;</p><p>He was so. Damn. Cute.&nbsp;</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t know if he felt the same way, but you had had a crush on him since 7th grade. He was so sweet and shy and his hair was perfect. I mean, like, how-the-hell-is-it-so-gorgeous perfect.&nbsp;</p><p>You knew he couldn&rsquo;t be your soulmate, though. His stain was on the palm of his right hand, while yours was around your ankle. There was no way the first time you two touched would be him grabbing your ankle. It made you somewhat disappointed, but you dreamt about being with him anyway.&nbsp;</p><p>As you were putting your books away, he came up next to you and fiddled with the padlock on his locker.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hi, (Y/n).&rdquo; He gave you a big grin. &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Great, thanks. You?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Same old, I guess.&rdquo;</p><p>That was usually the extent of your conversations. Every once in a while he would say, &ldquo;Ned is coming over to build LEGOs tonight,&rdquo; or you would say, &ldquo;My mom said we could order Chinese takeout tonight,&rdquo; but you never had any &ldquo;real&rdquo; conversations.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, c-can I ask a favor?&rdquo; he inquired suddenly.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; you answered, your heartbeat picking up speed.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Ned has a dentist appointment during chemistry tomorrow,&rdquo; he said, rubbing the back of his neck. &ldquo;Would you be my lab partner?&rdquo;</p><p>You couldn&rsquo;t help but smile. He was so cute and awkward.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to!&rdquo; you said happily.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Awesome! Thanks so much!&rdquo;</p><p>He closed his locker. &ldquo;See you tomorrow!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;See ya!&rdquo; you replied, waving as he walked away. When you were sure no one could see, you pumped your fist. You guys were going to officially hang out. Progress, right?</p><p>You closed your locker and started to head home. You put your earbuds in to drown out the sounds of New York. The road you normally walked down to get back to your apartment was closed for construction, so you took some back alleys instead. You were completely oblivious to everything.&nbsp;</p><p>Even the man following you.&nbsp;</p><p>You took a couple more turns when you felt someone grab your shoulder and spin you around. The man was wearing a ski mask and had a knife pointed at your abdomen.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Gimme the bag!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>You dropped your backpack immediately. He grabbed it and began to rifle through it. You slowly tried to inch away.&nbsp;</p><p>He shot back up and stuck the knife out.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move!&rdquo; he barked.&nbsp;</p><p>You put your hands up in surrender and he went back to the bag. Upon finding nothing of value, you assumed he would run away.

He kept the knife in his sleeve, still poking it against your gut. You made your way towards the river to cross the bridge.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not gonna make a sound, or I&rsquo;m gonna kill you right here, you understand?&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded.&nbsp;</p><p>You were halfway across the bridge when you saw something red and blue dart across the sky.&nbsp;</p><p>Spider-Man.</p><p>No doubt he saw you were in trouble.

You were spinning in the air and you couldn&rsquo;t make anything out and you were about to hit the water.</p><p>Suddenly someone grabbed your ankle. You looked up to see Spider-Man himself dangling from a web off the bridge, holding on as tight as he could.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You okay?&rdquo; he asked.
