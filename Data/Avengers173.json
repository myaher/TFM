Falling down her rabbit hole didn\u2019t lead (Y/N) to breathtaking lands of shit-talking flowers and fantastical adventures with hookah smoking caterpillars. No. Her reality was much darker. The hole that she fell through left her more dazed and confused than Alice had ever been.<br/></p><p>\u00a0 With her hair\u00a0whipping past her face, she wished bitterly that Lewis Carroll had written her life\u2019s story. At least then she might be able to do some shrooms to staunch the pain and help her to forget&hellip;forget everything. She didn\u2019t want to remember what she had done. She just wanted to disappear.</p><hr><p>\u00a0<b>W A K A N D A</b></p><p><b>\u00a0 </b>Nothing could have prepared Steve for the hellish creatures that charged the open barrier. It was the bloodiest war he had ever seen, and that was saying a lot. Even with Wanda and a special appearance by Thor to aid them, the battle left them gruesomely outnumbered to the deranged beasts that continued to pour in endless droves from the extraterrestrial ships like the bursting of several angry hornet\u2019s nests all at once.</p><p>\u00a0 He had hardly a moment to breathe between the slaughter of one creature before another one, or two, or five were on top of him again, wicked teeth and jagged claws slashing at every inch of skin they could gouge. He couldn\u2019t help the guttural fear that grasped him as he stared down the gullet of the beast that struck him to the ground, drips of blood and slobber spilled over him as the darkness became overpowering despite the blinding daylight that sweltered the battlefield in sickening heat.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 But before the beast could rip his head off, he felt the relief of its weight lifted from his ragged body, managing to lift his head enough to see Bucky wrestle the thing to the ground with the final stab of his oversized hunting knife as T\u2019Challa distracted the other two, slashing furiously with his own vibranium\u00a0claws. Bucky extended Steve his hand, patting his friend heavily on the back.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNever thought I\u2019d wish for the forties again,&ldquo; Bucky sighed as he retrieved his fallen gun, taking a moment to not pass out. He also never thought until that moment that he would ever have to wonder what his own personal hell would look like&hellip;but this wretched place was giving Hydra a run for its blood money.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNever thought I\u2019d be grateful for you saving my ass again,\u201d Steve responded breathlessly, punching Bucky in the shoulder who smiled back at him.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cComes with the job, pal,\u201d Bucky winked before charging back into the thick of the battle. Steve watched him go until he felt a presence\u00a0behind him, where he backflipped over the beast that tried to tackle him, but Steve was quicker. He tried not to think of the sticky blood that drowned his boots as he stepped from the creature&rsquo;s skull to continue his fight.</p><p>\u00a0 The Sun was a curse on the land, seeming to burn with a vendetta against the treachery that it was forced to witness over it\u2019s ancient, green Earth. It was an absolute mutiny. Despite the legendary beauty Wakanda had once held, it was now torn by the foulest of smells and the rotten spoils of war.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 But there was a sudden shift. A breeze blew past Steve, sending familiar chills down his spine as he turned towards the direction of the refreshing, northern wind. He wanted to believe it was her, that she had come back, but he would not give in to his foolish hopes. He needed to know for sure. He needed to see&hellip;</p><p>\u00a0 The battlefield parted around a thundercloud portal, shadows twisting sinisterly from beneath the smoke that rose and fell with a malevolent life of its own as blue lightning flashed within its depths. But he was transfixed on the dark figure that stepped from the portal, her ethereal beauty and undeniable power knocking the last remnants of breath he had been holding from his gasping lungs. It was like he always teased her: <i>how can someone be so damn addicting?</i></p><p><i>\u00a0 </i>She always had a snarky comment to follow his question, of course. And that was one of the millions of reasons why he loved her, and why his feet naturally gravitated towards her after his initial state of shock, desperate to hold her in his arms again. Wanting to apologize for ever letting her slip out of his hands, to begin with, and to promise that it would never happen again.</p><p>\u00a0 He was so spellbound by her presence that he hadn\u2019t bothered to notice the feral beast that launched itself towards him, fangs bared to sink into his neck. But by the time he caught sight of the creature from his periphery, it was already too late. Throwing up his arms to protect himself, he waited for the fatal slash of claws that never came. Peering over his defenses, he saw the beast writhing on the ground with a silver ice katana buried deep into its own neck.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 His head whipped back towards (Y/N), her eyes consumed by a haunting sapphire\u00a0light that flickered out as soon as she saw him. She narrowed her eyes at him a moment, then allowed a huge smile to brighten her features that glowed in the now tolerable sunlight. They both crossed the field to each other, (Y/N) not even looking at the beasts before they burst into amethyst flames.</p><p>\u00a0 And Steve couldn\u2019t help but wonder: <i>How had she gotten so much more powerful in so little time? </i>But as soon as she jumped into his arms, all worries melted from his mind, dissolving into the overwhelming feeling of relief. He squeezed her tight, whispering\u00a0\u2018I love you\u2019 into the crook of her neck as he kissed the top of her head, noticing the strands of white that decorated her {your color} hair, but forgot as soon as she pulled away, revealing the <g class=\"gr_ gr_614 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del\" id=\"614\" data-gr-id=\"614\">face</g> that he had missed more than anything he\u2019d ever missed in his life. Overcome by her presence, he tried to lean in for a kiss, but her face dropped as she threw her hand over his lips. His brows furrowed as she giggled playfully.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cLook, you can kiss me until I\u2019m blue in the face once this is all over, Captain,\u201d she purred, pursing her lips seductively as she leaned closer to him.\u00a0\u201cBut first, I need to know where Vision is.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Steve pulled her hand into his own as he laughed at his own distraction.\u00a0\u201cAnd finally we\u2019ve reached the day where\u00a0<i>you\u2019re</i> the one more focused on the mission than <i>me</i>,\u201d he teased her, kissing her hand that she cupped around his cheek before it fell away, her impatience getting the better of her.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSteve, there isn\u2019t time for this. Tell me where Vision is, now&hellip;please,\u201d she added politely at the end.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYeah&hellip;yeah, of course,\u201d Steve nodded as he pointed towards a large, grey building that was built into the luscious cliffside. Raging waterfalls spilled from the end of the jungle like tears rushing from the crystal clear skies, a startling comparison to the massacre below its tranquility. Just as he began to speak again, they both caught sight of two figures breaking out of one of the windows where they fell into the endless sea of trees below.</p><p>\u00a0 \u2018<i>Guys, we got a Vision situation here</i>,\u2019 Sam called through Steve\u2019s earpiece.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThat was Vision. We have to get to him,\u201d Steve said quickly to (Y/N), tugging on her hand towards the forest, but before he could relay that news over the intercom, her other hand fell onto his own, pulling it away from his ear.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNo, wait!\u201d She exclaimed, but quickly composed herself. \u201cSteve, I\u2019ve got this one. You stay here and fight. The team needs you down here. I\u2019ve got <g class=\"gr_ gr_623 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"623\" data-gr-id=\"623\">Vision</g>.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBut-\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Steve started, but (Y/N) kissed his cheek, letting her lips linger close to his ear.\u00a0\u201cStay here. I\u2019ve got this,\u201d she repeated. And, before he could argue, she was already gone, the last of her image disappearing into the shadows of the jungle.</p><p>\u00a0 Steve tried to turn away, he really did. He wanted to trust her, but there was something so&hellip;off about what had just happened. The way she wouldn\u2019t kiss him (it was more likely that she would\u2019ve jumped his bones right there on the battlefield than her not kiss him at all), the way she giggled like a schoolgirl (yeah, right), and the way she wouldn\u2019t let him fight with her when they had <i>just </i>reunited. Everything felt fake. Forced. It was an act.</p><p>\u00a0 There were some things that couldn\u2019t be faked, and one of them was love.</p><p>\u00a0<i> That was not (Y/N),</i>\u00a0Steve realized with a striking jolt, pivoting on his heels away from the battlefield to follow whatever was taking the form of his fiancee.</p><hr><p>\u00a0 Branches clawed at (Y/N)\u2019s arms and legs, but she blew them aside with her magic, snapping entire trees in half to make way for her until she heard a struggle through the leaves. She ducked into the bushes, lithely making her way towards a clearing that opened up to a fight between Veronica (which she guessed was being controlled by Bruce) and one of Thanos\u2019s meathead minions, a creature that looked like an overcooked Ninja Turtle. The two threw punch after punch at each other in the pit of the waterfalls, tripping over themselves in the shallow river.</p><p>\u00a0 She watched for a moment until her Power Stone began to burn against her chest, signaling for her to keep moving as she was getting closer to her target. She grappled up the side of a small cliff to peer over a plane where Vision and another one of Thanos\u2019s minions were standing face-to-face just as Vision was knocked down to his knees. The black and gold cloaked minion towered over Vision with a bladed staff. (Y/N) almost stopped him, but thought better of it just as the blade sunk into Vision\u2019s chest with a guttural groan.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI thought you were a formidable machine,\u201d the minion growled, hovering Vision above the ground as his form began to flicker. \u201cBut you\u2019re dying like any man.\u201d Releasing the blade, the minion left Vision to crumble in a heap to the ground. But before he could strike again, (Y/N) sliced his head clean off. His torso fell to the side in a cloud of red dirt before a wide-eyed Vision who stared at the body, at (Y/N), then back at the body. The sorceress never even flinched.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThird time I\u2019ve beheaded someone in just over two days. Think there\u2019s a rehab for that?\u201d (Y/N) joked darkly as she twirled her blue-bloodied dagger, then replaced it in her holster. With a sigh, she extended her hand to Vision.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI suppose a thank you is in order, now,\u201d he laughed wearily as he leaned against her for support.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBetter be. I don\u2019t save just anybody, Mr. Robot. I have priorities, dammit.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWell, I am certainly glad to be one of them,\u201d Vision responded, groaning as his wound extended and contracted with every step he took. He knew he shouldn\u2019t be walking, but at least he had (Y/N) to fight for him now, despite the shudder that ran through him at what he had just seen her do. But he knew her, and more importantly, he trusted her as his girlfriend\u2019s best friend. At least he knew that was finally safe.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 However, through his increasingly fuzzy vision, he noticed they were trekking further into the jungle, the opposite direction of where they needed to go. He cleared his throat. \u201cMay I ask, though. Where are we walking to? I believe the main facility is back that way,\u201d he commented, looking over to (Y/N) who was staring straight ahead, her face no longer anything that he recognized as the sounds of Bruce\u2019s fight died down and the silence blanketed the heavy trees that surrounded them like prison bars.\u00a0\u201c(Y/N)?\u201d Vision asked her again. But the chill that greeted him froze him to the core just as his stone began to sear into his skull.</p><p>\u00a0 Suddenly, (Y/N) turned on Vision, but all she could focus on was the golden Mind Stone. It beckoned to her with tantalizing whispers of desire.</p><p>\u00a0 And finally, she understood Thanos\u2019s claim for destiny. No, she <i>felt</i> it. The stone was rightfully hers for the taking. It always had been. Thanos had just been the one to point it out to her.</p><p>\u00a0 Her own Power Stone seemed to call out to the Mind Stone as it burned furiously against her chest, making Vision wince in response as his eyes met with hers through the shadows of the brush.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI promise, this is nothing personal,\u201d (Y/N) said to him distantly as she shoved him to the ground. She encircled him, icy fingers trailing his neck as she rounded to face him, himself barely able to get to his knees.\u00a0\u201cJust something Thanos wants. And what Thanos wants&hellip;\u201d she said, raising her hand towards the stone,\u00a0\u201cI get.\u201d And with her final snarl, she sent a beam of purple and silver light towards Vision, extracting a roar of anguish from his lips that burst through the treetops like the blares of an alarm.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 She could see the Mind Stone beginning to shift in his forehead, her vicious magic carving it out of his own head before her very eyes. From beyond the mind control, her confused and terrified <g class=\"gr_ gr_619 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling multiReplace\" id=\"619\" data-gr-id=\"619\">self felt</g> something shatter deep inside of her. Something that she couldn\u2019t understand or begin to define. Before that moment, she always believed that she was the most broken that she could ever be. There was nothing else dark enough to phase her any longer.</p><p>\u00a0 But she was wrong. So, painfully wrong.</p><p>\u00a0 Everything was more intense in those torturous seconds. The humidity from the scornful Sun. The roaring of the waterfalls. The screams of some alien creature. The unforgiving nature of her magic that was so cold, it burned.</p><p>\u00a0 But as soon as she saw the beginnings of exposed wiring, she heard a terrified voice shriek out her name.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201c(Y/N)!? What are you doing?\u201d Wanda cried, not able to believe the atrocity\u00a0before her, but she snapped out of it when she saw Vision\u2019s face. In her haste, she shot (Y/N) with a red spell that knocked her friend into a backward roll. Landing on her feet, (Y/N) snapped her head up to Wanda who rushed to Vision\u2019s aid, asking if he was okay as he fell limp into her arms.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m doing what\u2019s right for the Universe. Something you\u2019ve never been able to do,\u201d (Y/N) spit at her, not even bothering to conceal herself any longer, allowing the Sapphire of her mind control infiltrate her eyes with brutal intensity. Wanda watched (Y/N) with horror, finally understanding that what was stalking her was not her friend any longer.\u00a0\u201cEven when you tried, you still managed to kill eleven innocent people in a country you had no right to be in&hellip;do<g class=\"gr_ gr_578 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"578\" data-gr-id=\"578\">n\u2019t</g> you feel disgusted with yourself for what you did? How can you even live with yourself? Murderer,\u201d she dragged out the words, the emphasis like dragging a dagger across Wanda\u2019s heart, slowly <g class=\"gr_ gr_577 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del\" id=\"577\" data-gr-id=\"577\">slicing</g> deeper and deeper each time she repeated it.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cStop,\u201d Wanda quivered, closing her eyes to the thoughts of that obscene day that haunted her every single night. But she couldn\u2019t shut them out this time.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cMurderer,\u201d (Y/N) continued to chant, crouching lower in her stance to launch herself at the witch, preparing for the kill.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t listen to her. She\u2019s baiting you, Wanda,\u201d Vision pleaded, pulling Wanda from her nightmares that (Y/N) was so clearly inducing, the red magic of the Reality Stone sparking off her own fingertips as the ice sorceress snarled at her.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHow can you trust yourself after losing control time and time again? The cycle just continues, Wanda. You use your powers, and people die. Maybe you were just born a bad omen. Born to cause death wherever you go&hellip;and to whoever you grow close to. That reminds me&hellip;how is Pietro doing these days?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Wanda stopped crying, her trembling body going still as her eyes flickered up to (Y/N), a rage like nothing she had ever seen filling the witch\u2019s eyes. Laying Vision against a stone, she stood protectively in front of him, her hands spiraling offensively in front of her as she stared down the imposter. (Y/N) just laughed.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cReally?\u201d she scoffed, throwing her hair over her shoulder.\u00a0\u201cPlease, Wanda. We both know that I\u2019m stronger than you. <i>Everyone</i> knows it. And I always have been.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBut I have more to lose,\u201d Wanda concluded through gritted teeth as she charged (Y/N) who dodged her first <g class=\"gr_ gr_594 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"594\" data-gr-id=\"594\">beam,</g> but got blasted into the trunk of an ancient tree that somehow held its ground on the second. Wanda tried to blast (Y/N) again, aiming for her heart to stun the sorceress, but, as predicted, (Y/N) was not only <g class=\"gr_ gr_593 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"593\" data-gr-id=\"593\">faster,</g> but much stronger. Holding off Wanda\u2019s beam as she began to walk towards the witch, her hands held firmly in front of her as she placed one foot in front of the other until she was almost nose-to-nose with Wanda where she slipped out of the beam, spinning to her left to elbow Wanda in the side of her head, sending the witch sprawling into the dirt. She attempted to stand her ground again, but (Y/N) swept her legs from under her and kicked her into a boulder where she smashed her head.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) walked over to where she lay, toeing the witch curiously, but her body lay still, red leather jacket frosted in wicked silver ice that curled in amethyst smoke, rising like the dead from a grave. With a satisfied smirk, (Y/N) crossed the plane to reach Vision, planning to finish her mission, but a body crashed into her, throwing her to the ground as he pinned her wrists to the dirt.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 His face was still beautiful despite the blood and ash that smeared his features, dusting his beard that had grown unkept in her absence. In her head, she begged him to run away, to get as far from her as possible before she&hellip;before she did something that she would never be able to forgive herself for. Something so unthinkable&hellip;but it wasn\u2019t unthinkable. It was right at her fingertips that were already glowing a dangerous shade of violet, daring him to test her any further. But of course, he did. And she hated him for it.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201c(Y/N)! Wake up!\u201d Steve ordered her, knocking the blade from her grasp before she could stab him, digging his knee into her chest.\u00a0\u201cCome back to me! You know me. You love me. Don\u2019t leave me here, (Y/N). Please.\u201d She rolled on top of him for a moment, but he pinned her back down again, hooking his foot behind her knee to slam her harder into the ground. \u201cYou\u2019re so much stronger than whatever\u2019s controlling you. You are (Y/N) (Y/L/N). And you\u2019re coming home with me because you are the fiercest person I\u2019ve ever met. You can beat this. You always have. Please! You have to wake up!\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 He begged her, kissing her forehead, her cheeks, her lips, but her eyes were distant. Blank. He didn\u2019t recognize them. They weren\u2019t hers. He shook her, the tears falling down his face onto her heaving chest, but it was hopeless. He knew what he had to do&hellip;but he could never. He would rather die than do that.</p><p>\u00a0 His eyes shot up to hers as her lips began to move, a strangled voice attempting to escape the barriers. He waited, encouraging her to speak, but her eyes narrowed just as she found her voice, eyes flashing in an eerie shade of violet.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cGet off of me!\u201d she growled as she forced him off of her in an explosion of violet that careened him onto his back. She stood over him as she kicked him in the side like a wounded dog. Lifting her chin, she sneered at him distastefully.\u00a0\u201cWeak idiot. Even when you know that she\u2019s gone, you still can\u2019t bear to kill me. Pitiful. We need strong men and women in the next life. I hope the Snap wipes you out first. Call it Darwinian justice.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 And with her final words to him, she used her magic to throw him like a bullet through the trees. Hell knew where she threw him or if he survived, but she didn\u2019t care. She only turned back to Vision who was being caressed by Wanda, all color drained from her face as he pleaded with her to destroy the stone, but it was too late. (Y/N) was already prowling towards them, a predator, her aura of the same eerie violet light from her eyes surrounding her figure. She exuded power in its purest form. She was Power.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 Wanda tried to stop her one last time, stronger than the last, but she was cast aside once again. It was a hard fought battle, torturous to witness, but despairing in the end. There were flashes of battles between her versus Bucky, versus T\u2019Challa, versus Bruce, Natasha, Rhodey, Sam&hellip;they all attempted to match her, but she was an avalanche rushing down a mountain. A winter storm against a ship in the middle of a raging sea. They came at her one at a time, but even if they worked together, it was hopeless. Maybe this was her destiny. Maybe Strange was wrong.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 No, he was wrong. She wasn\u2019t the hero in this story. She was never meant to be.</p><p>\u00a0 Grasping Vision with her magic, she ripped the last of the Mind Stone from his head with her bare hands, wires wrenched from their sockets with dying sparks as she dropped his gray, lifeless body to the ground like he was nothing. Not even a person. Just a means to Thanos\u2019s end.</p><p>\u00a0 Inside, (Y/N) couldn\u2019t stop replaying the image of his pleading eyes that dulled and rolled into the back of his head the moment she tore the stone from his skull, the way his last breath sounded as it escaped his lips, undoubtedly the most horrifying sound she had ever heard. She was a murderer. There was no mistaking it. She had just killed someone, someone she cared about, with her own bare hands. It was something she had never done before. It was&hellip;it was&hellip;</p><p>\u00a0 Beautiful. The Mind Stone glowed in a scintillating golden light brighter than the striking Sun, it\u2019s intensity an honor to behold. She couldn\u2019t believe that she was actually holding it. No dreams could compare. The key to Thanos\u2019s approval, the key to the balance of the Universe. She studied the gem carefully as it floated across her fingertips, noticing the tiny flecks of orange and red that twisted menacingly inside the crystal, knowing that the power was desperately searching for a release, ready to wreak havoc now that there was nobody to tame <g class=\"gr_ gr_592 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling multiReplace\" id=\"592\" data-gr-id=\"592\">it\u2019s</g> tantalizing power.</p><p>\u00a0 She was broken from her trance when the gem suddenly began to burn hotter than ever before, almost causing her to drop the damned thing when she heard the familiar thunder of an opening portal, feeling his presence take control of the very Earth she stood on. She turned her head to peer over her shoulder, watching Thanos step from his portal, flashing her the emerald Time Stone that gleamed on his gauntlet. She flashed him the Mind Stone in response, earning her a grin from his scarred face, claw marks grazing down his cheeks in daunting memories. But it had all been worth it when he approached (Y/N), her knee beginning to bend in his presence, but he held her chin instead, making her look his dead in the eye.</p><p>\u00a0 \u201cYou must not bow, my child, for you have done the Universe an exceptional service today that will span for many long generations,\u201d Thanos announced to her proudly. \u201cYou will forever be remembered for your bravery, for you are the only one of my loyal servants to have not failed me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI would never, Father,\u201d (Y/N) responded submissively, but held her head up high to Thanos, like a soldier receiving\u00a0the most morbid Medal of Honor to have ever been given. Absolute mutiny.</p><p>\u00a0 Everyone was forced to watch from the outskirts of (Y/N)\u2019s shield that surrounded herself and Thanos as she handed him the stone. Nothing could stop the disgusted grimace that bubbled up from deep inside Steve\u2019s core when the name\u00a0\u201cFather\u201d spilled from (Y/N)\u2019s lips. It was so casual, he almost believed her. But it wasn\u2019t her. That thing just looked like her. But it didn\u2019t make what he was forced to watch any easier to digest. He wasn\u2019t sure if he would ever be able to truly swallow it down. Not that he had the time to do so anyway.</p><p>\u00a0 Thanos grasped the Mind Stone from (Y/N)\u2019s fingertips, slamming the crystal into his gauntlet to complete his collection, the electrifying jolts of magic racing through his veins in vibrant colors. (Y/N) could feel the power surge through her own veins as she felt his hand rest on her shoulder. She breathed it in like oxygen. It was better than oxygen. Intoxicating.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 But the connection was sliced off by the blade of an ax that buried itself into Thanos\u2019s wide chest, purple blood spurting from the gaping wound as the forcefield that surrounded them dissipated into thin air. Thor landed next to (Y/N), preparing for a fight, but Thanos waved her off. She stood to his side as a sentry, a neutral expression painted on her face as Thor grabbed the back of Thanos\u2019s head and the hilt of his ax, burying it deeper into Thanos\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u00a0 \u201cI told you, you\u2019d die for that,\u201d Thor avowed, vengeance set in his immovable expression. He had made good on his threat, watching as his brother\u2019s murderer roared in pain, lolling his head to the side when Thor ceased the ax. Thanos began mumbling something, his words disjointed by his dying breaths&hellip;or so Thor believed. But (Y/N) knew better. He wouldn\u2019t have waved her off if the bastard didn\u2019t have a plan.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou&hellip;you should have gone for the head,\u201d Thanos growled as he shoved Thor away from him, ripping the ax from his body as he snatched (Y/N) roughly by the shoulder, absorbing her powers into his gauntlet as his Power Stone completed. And with a final haunting grin towards his audience, he snapped his fingers and the Sun had finally seemed to have had enough as the world went blind, only Thor\u2019s lasting howl echoing in the back of everyone\u2019s minds.</p><p>\u00a0 When the world returned to Steve\u2019s vision, all he saw was (Y/N) as her body hit the ground. He wasn\u2019t fast enough to catch her, but he lunged to reach her, trying to find a pulse that wasn\u2019t there. He gently brushed the flyaways from her face, tracing her bruised and scarred cheeks that were devoid of any color. He tucked her into his chest, rocking slowly back and forth on the forest floor in disbelief, not wanting to accept what had just happened. Who he was holding.</p><p>\u00a0 This wasn\u2019t how it was supposed to be. This wasn\u2019t right. They should have been home by then, embracing each other in bed after a sound night of sleep. He was supposed to be looking into her eyes, getting lost in the plans of their future together. The endless possibilities they were supposed to share.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 But reality was cruel. No, he wouldn\u2019t accept it. His mind reeled back to the events of the last few days, but nothing made sense. Nothing mattered anymore. Everything felt meaningless as he pulled her closer to his chest, burying his face in her hair.</p><p>\u00a0 All he could do was choke out strangled\u00a0\u2018I love you\u2019s into the deafening silence. He had no prayers left. She had been his last, and only one.</p><p>\u00a0 Thor stared in shock at Steve and (Y/N), watching the life leave Steve just as it had (Y/N). His teammates, friends, family, people he thought he would spend the rest of his life with. He understood the abhorrent depths of what Steve was feeling, distinguishing the dull pain that shrouded his friend\u2019s eyes as it had his own when he laid over Loki\u2019s body. And everything came full circle as his eyes met the smoking gauntlet on Thanos\u2019s hand, the entire thing melted and charred in black ash, a foretelling of the next disturbing minutes to come.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d Thor shouted at him in desperation.\u00a0\u201cWhat did you do?!\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 But all Thanos did was backhand Thor across the plane, striding over to where (Y/N) lay in Steve\u2019s arms, determined to retrieve his perfect weapon. Steve fought Thanos, fought him harder than he\u2019d ever fought for anything, standing over (Y/N) as Thanos bore his full weight on the grieving Super Soldier. Steve gritted his teeth, his arms giving way to the massive Mad Titan that threatened to crush him and take all that he had left of her. He couldn\u2019t understand it. But she was really gone now. She was really&hellip;</p><p>\u00a0 Thanos swatted Steve aside, finally reaching (Y/N)\u2019s body that he carefully caressed in his arms, giving one last prideful look towards Thor before he stepped back into his portal, disappearing from the horrors that he cast upon the Universe.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 Steve awoke a moment after Thanos left, scrambling to his feet as he called (Y/N)\u2019s name. With a heavy heart, Bucky held his friend, trying to calm him down, but Steve pushed Bucky off of him. Limping towards Thor, he repeated hollowly,\u00a0\u201cwhere is he? Where did he take her? Thor, where\u2019d he go?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 Thor had no response for him. He wished that he had any words, anything at all to console Steve, but he didn\u2019t. He had nothing. Everything he had worked <g class=\"gr_ gr_617 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"617\" data-gr-id=\"617\">for</g> to get the ax. Nedavelir. Taking on the force of a fucking star. None of it made a difference. And just like Steve, Thor felt that everything was meaningless. Half his people were slaughtered, now with Heimdall, Loki, and (Y/N). What more could Thanos take from him? The Mad Titan had ruined him.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSteve?\u201d Bucky called out, finally getting Steve\u2019s attention just as his body crashed into a flurry of gray ash. Steve stumbled towards his best friend, but again, he was too late. He knelt down beside the ash, placing a trembling hand onto the ground where Bucky had just been, but&hellip;the numbness suddenly returned. It was so striking that Steve\u2019s knees finally gave out beneath him as he stared from Thor to the ground. There was an emptiness in them. Like looking at a corpse.</p><p>\u00a0 He heard light footsteps race behind him, registering them as Natasha\u2019s before she placed her hand on his shoulder, her other hand pressed to her stomach, her mouth agape as she caught sight of Vision\u2019s dead body. But Steve could barely feel her attempt at comfort. He could only stare at where Bucky had been.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhat is this? What the hell is happening?\u201d Rhodey tried to ask Thor, but Thor was just as speechless as Natasha, Bruce, and Rocket, not one being able to rationalize what Thanos had just done.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOh, God,\u201d was Steve\u2019s only response, a shard of ice buried in his heart.</p><hr><p><b>D I S T A N T \u00a0- \u00a0P L A N E T</b></p><p><b>\u00a0</b> She awoke to the soft sunlight of dawn, the moment just as the Sun broke the boundaries of the horizon to begin a new day.</p><p>\u00a0 But what was the point anymore? What is a new day when half the Universe had just been slaughtered? She felt like she was frozen, like time couldn\u2019t go on until everything returned to the way it was just after the Avengers saved New York. After possibilities arose, and the word\u00a0\u201cheroes\u201d actually had a meaning to her. When anything had a\u00a0meaning to her.</p><p>\u00a0 All she could remember was a flash of Steve dissolving in the shadows of the jungle, the blinding gold of the Mind Stone, and Vision\u2019s hollow eye sockets.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 She didn\u2019t want to open her eyes. She didn\u2019t want to wake to a world where Steve could possibly be gone. Where her family was dead&hellip;again. In a Universe where she was responsible for severing the lifelines of half the people in it. She couldn\u2019t decide if it would be better or worse to know who had survived and who had&hellip;But the voice that she dreaded cut through her core like steel grating iron.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSo, she finally wakes,\u201d Thanos proclaimed into the sunrise, basking in its welcoming glow that brought promises of a bright future for the Universe he had just rescued. His destiny had been met. But, there was still one loose end he had to tie up before everything was settled. Without looking behind him, he felt (Y/N) stand from her cot, striding calmly to the front of their wooden shack on the edge of a viridescent landscape that sprawled over miles and miles of luscious hills that sprouted millions of trees. She heard the wild call of a lonesome bird, its one-note song solidifying something heavy in her chest. Stars hung faintly in the dawning sky beside a low hovering moon, it\u2019s surface so close, (Y/N) felt like if she strained enough on her toes, she could poke one of its craters, hopefully, fall inside one and never come out again.</p><p>\u00a0 Wherever this serene place was, it was a stone-cold liar. A deceiving land that attempted to replace beauty with the agony that Thanos had caused that would ripple across generations like a hurricane causing tsunamis in every surrounding country it could reach. This place disgusted (Y/N), but she couldn\u2019t turn away from the rising sun, furious at its audacity to continue to rise, and for time to continue to move forward. It was an outrage against humanity.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou did it, didn\u2019t you?\u201d (Y/N) whispered calmly, a deathly calm that didn\u2019t surprise Thanos, but still left him with a grave chill as she sat beside him.</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) already knew the answer to her question. She could feel it in her bones. But she had to hear it stated out loud to fully believe it. She had to.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhat other reason would I have to be here enjoying the sunrise?\u201d he answered, leaning back to take in the warmth as he closed his eyes, fully content in the experience he had dreamed of for decades.</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) wasn\u2019t having that.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDoes it feel as satisfying without her here?\u201d she whispered coldly, her gaze fixed on the cattails that swayed mournfully in the breeze, only their brushes across the long grasses filling the sullen silence.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou remind me of her, you know,\u201d Thanos finally said, evading her heartwrenching question to test the waters.\u00a0\u201cShe was brave like you. A fearsome fighter&hellip;I may not have her with me any longer, but I do have you.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 The wrath that was seething beneath her calm exterior finally broke as she ripped a large stake of wood from the ceiling, projecting it into his bicep where it buried itself into his muscle with a sickening crunch. He just stared at it passively, withdrawing it from his flesh like a woodchip as he tossed it from hand to hand. (Y/N) still refused to look at him, but her eyes had grown much darker with a lust for blood.</p><p>\u00a0 Yet her magic was depleted. The Power Stone was destroyed. All she had left was her boiling rage and hunger for vengeance as her fingers curled into fists atop her knees.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou don\u2019t <i>have</i> me,\u201d (Y/N) sneered. \u201cI\u2019m not yours to have. The stones are gone, you rapacious sadist. You know that you can\u2019t control me otherwise&hellip;so why even try?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Thanos could see through her hateful words like shattering glass, see the pain that was slowly eating her alive. He knew that she was goading him into killing her. Not able to handle the guilt of what she believed to be murder. And <g class=\"gr_ gr_579 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"579\" data-gr-id=\"579\">her</g> wish, she would finally receive because she was right. He would never be able to break her far enough to become his new right hand. Never.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThere was a time when I had the utmost faith in you, (Y/N),\u201d Thanos ranted as he stood above her. \u201cA time when I could see the opportunities\u00a0for us together as clear as this beautiful day rising before us. But it seems like our time together must be cut short, unfortunately. I once thought you were the only one who could carry out what needs to be done from this day forward, but it appears that another may be able to take your place.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) froze at that admission. He had more plans beyond the Snap. She felt dizzy at the thought of how stupid she had been, believing that somehow after this was all over that he would be satisfied. But a power-hungry madman like himself would never be satisfied. It was just in his nature.</p><p>\u00a0 She tried to make a move to run, but he caught her by the neck, anticipating her escape.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDespite how you\u2019ve portrayed yourself over the last few years, you always somehow return to your roots: a runaway. Hiding from your fears when they finally get the best of you. You wear a nice mask, but it runs in your blood,\u201d he growled at her as she struggled in his grasp.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 But then she saw it. A shard of amethyst light buried in the wound on his wrist. It was small, and probably not what she thought it was, but she had a shimmer of slim hope that wedged its way into her veins, forcing her fingers to reach towards the lustrous fragment that she could have sworn had winked at her.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cStill, I may come to regret this decision. You would have been my crowning jewel to a now worthy empire&hellip;but I doubt it,\u201d Thanos declared as he grabbed ahold of a gleaming silver sword, aiming the blade towards her heart.\u00a0\u201cMay you go in peace, my child,\u201d he said to her just as her fingers grasped the shard of amethyst, her intentions going to a portal, willing it to appear behind her. But instead, she felt the freezing cold blade impale her gut, narrowly dodging her heart when she lurched in his grasp. Yet, the pain wasn\u2019t any less intense, digging around her insides like a living being as Thanos glared her down.</p><p>\u00a0 She glared back at him with piercing silver eyes that gave him whiplash as he struggled for understanding. He just barely glanced at the amethyst fragment she was clutching in her bloody fingers before a portal opened behind her, exactly where her mind had wielded it. She gave him one last victorious smile before she shoved herself off of his blade, the sharp edge grazing vital organs in her body before she let herself fall into the endless void, ignoring the sinking feeling that pulled her towards the desire to end it all. The only thing she could hear was the violent, bloodthirsty roars of Thanos that echoed around her, but even those faded as she fell down&hellip;down&hellip;down the rabbit hole. Now, all she could hear was the whistling of the wind whip past her freezing cold ears. Everything was getting colder as her breath became a struggle. But she decided to struggle.</p><p>\u00a0 Maybe there was one thing that still gave her life meaning after all.</p><p>\u00a0 Revenge.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b> \u00a0<g class=\"gr_ gr_563 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del\" id=\"563\" data-gr-id=\"563\">T O</g> \u00a0- \u00a0B E \u00a0- \u00a0C O N T I N U E D</b></p><p><b>T A G S</b>: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlSoQ-tzWXqmHBQjEOwnDYg\">@benedrylcumbersnatch</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mR0IW7pRRTlGjpaBZzLfoVw\">@daniellajocelyn</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYlu0CG6g0HV126mDX5EUAA\">@shannonr2003</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muXrTh8-Cv3mjVDxjEs3Ktg\">@ever-so-slightly-below-average</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKJ5sTXat_3jOUb9CtnlJjw\">@mysteriouslysharkbait</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mt6uzR8mKp99MC6sWbfZb_w\">@sireennotsiren</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDkKVCSpAX6qq9iDj5NKJLw\">@pluvialday</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/me4cXs-LqZjfS_X4AiYJsiQ\">@thenogravity</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjfaeGdUxkUDrEfygL1CdqQ\">@iiicurlingwavesiii</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtifdrf4Wv9zh77_HIw6Rng\">@i-only-signed-up-for-fanfiction</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUxwWE4gjyaVLsK28-QE45Q\">@introvertedsin</a></p><p>**Updates: And that\u2019s the end of Part 7, my loves!

If anyone has any requests, I\u2019d be so fucking honored to take them on as well as finish some of my other unfinished projects (including an overly ambitious Harry Potter Fem!Slytherin Reader series if anyone\u2019s interested).

Falling down her rabbit hole didn\u2019t lead (Y/N) to breathtaking lands of shit-talking flowers and fantastical adventures with hookah smoking caterpillars. No. Her reality was much darker. The hole that she fell through left her more dazed and confused than Alice had ever been.<br></p><p>\u00a0 With her hair\u00a0whipping past her face, she wished bitterly that Lewis Carroll had written her life\u2019s story. At least then she might be able to do some shrooms to staunch the pain and help her to forget\u2026forget everything. She didn\u2019t want to remember what she had done. She just wanted to disappear.</p><hr><p>\u00a0<b>W A K A N D A</b></p><p><b>\u00a0 </b>Nothing could have prepared Steve for the hellish creatures that charged the open barrier. It was the bloodiest war he had ever seen, and that was saying a lot. Even with Wanda and a special appearance by Thor to aid them, the battle left them gruesomely outnumbered to the deranged beasts that continued to pour in endless droves from the extraterrestrial ships like the bursting of several angry hornet\u2019s nests all at once.</p><p>\u00a0 He had hardly a moment to breathe between the slaughter of one creature before another one, or two, or five were on top of him again, wicked teeth and jagged claws slashing at every inch of skin they could gouge. He couldn\u2019t help the guttural fear that grasped him as he stared down the gullet of the beast that struck him to the ground, drips of blood and slobber spilled over him as the darkness became overpowering despite the blinding daylight that sweltered the battlefield in sickening heat.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 But before the beast could rip his head off, he felt the relief of its weight lifted from his ragged body, managing to lift his head enough to see Bucky wrestle the thing to the ground with the final stab of his oversized hunting knife as T\u2019Challa distracted the other two, slashing furiously with his own vibranium\u00a0claws. Bucky extended Steve his hand, patting his friend heavily on the back.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNever thought I\u2019d wish for the forties again,\u201c Bucky sighed as he retrieved his fallen gun, taking a moment to not pass out. He also never thought until that moment that he would ever have to wonder what his own personal hell would look like\u2026but this wretched place was giving Hydra a run for its blood money.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNever thought I\u2019d be grateful for you saving my ass again,\u201d Steve responded breathlessly, punching Bucky in the shoulder who smiled back at him.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cComes with the job, pal,\u201d Bucky winked before charging back into the thick of the battle. Steve watched him go until he felt a presence\u00a0behind him, where he backflipped over the beast that tried to tackle him, but Steve was quicker. He tried not to think of the sticky blood that drowned his boots as he stepped from the creature\u2019s skull to continue his fight.</p><p>\u00a0 The Sun was a curse on the land, seeming to burn with a vendetta against the treachery that it was forced to witness over it\u2019s ancient, green Earth. It was an absolute mutiny. Despite the legendary beauty Wakanda had once held, it was now torn by the foulest of smells and the rotten spoils of war.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 But there was a sudden shift. A breeze blew past Steve, sending familiar chills down his spine as he turned towards the direction of the refreshing, northern wind. He wanted to believe it was her, that she had come back, but he would not give in to his foolish hopes. He needed to know for sure. He needed to see\u2026</p><p>\u00a0 The battlefield parted around a thundercloud portal, shadows twisting sinisterly from beneath the smoke that rose and fell with a malevolent life of its own as blue lightning flashed within its depths. But he was transfixed on the dark figure that stepped from the portal, her ethereal beauty and undeniable power knocking the last remnants of breath he had been holding from his gasping lungs. It was like he always teased her: <i>how can someone be so damn addicting?</i></p><p><i>\u00a0 </i>She always had a snarky comment to follow his question, of course. And that was one of the millions of reasons why he loved her, and why his feet naturally gravitated towards her after his initial state of shock, desperate to hold her in his arms again. Wanting to apologize for ever letting her slip out of his hands, to begin with, and to promise that it would never happen again.</p><p>\u00a0 He was so spellbound by her presence that he hadn\u2019t bothered to notice the feral beast that launched itself towards him, fangs bared to sink into his neck. But by the time he caught sight of the creature from his periphery, it was already too late. Throwing up his arms to protect himself, he waited for the fatal slash of claws that never came. Peering over his defenses, he saw the beast writhing on the ground with a silver ice katana buried deep into its own neck.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 His head whipped back towards (Y/N), her eyes consumed by a haunting sapphire\u00a0light that flickered out as soon as she saw him. She narrowed her eyes at him a moment, then allowed a huge smile to brighten her features that glowed in the now tolerable sunlight. They both crossed the field to each other, (Y/N) not even looking at the beasts before they burst into amethyst flames.</p><p>\u00a0 And Steve couldn\u2019t help but wonder: <i>How had she gotten so much more powerful in so little time? </i>But as soon as she jumped into his arms, all worries melted from his mind, dissolving into the overwhelming feeling of relief. He squeezed her tight, whispering\u00a0\u2018I love you\u2019 into the crook of her neck as he kissed the top of her head, noticing the strands of white that decorated her {your color} hair, but forgot as soon as she pulled away, revealing the <g class=\"gr_ gr_614 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del\" id=\"614\" data-gr-id=\"614\">face</g> that he had missed more than anything he\u2019d ever missed in his life. Overcome by her presence, he tried to lean in for a kiss, but her face dropped as she threw her hand over his lips. His brows furrowed as she giggled playfully.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cLook, you can kiss me until I\u2019m blue in the face once this is all over, Captain,\u201d she purred, pursing her lips seductively as she leaned closer to him.\u00a0\u201cBut first, I need to know where Vision is.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Steve pulled her hand into his own as he laughed at his own distraction.\u00a0\u201cAnd finally we\u2019ve reached the day where\u00a0<i>you\u2019re</i> the one more focused on the mission than <i>me</i>,\u201d he teased her, kissing her hand that she cupped around his cheek before it fell away, her impatience getting the better of her.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSteve, there isn\u2019t time for this. Tell me where Vision is, now\u2026please,\u201d she added politely at the end.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYeah\u2026yeah, of course,\u201d Steve nodded as he pointed towards a large, grey building that was built into the luscious cliffside. Raging waterfalls spilled from the end of the jungle like tears rushing from the crystal clear skies, a startling comparison to the massacre below its tranquility. Just as he began to speak again, they both caught sight of two figures breaking out of one of the windows where they fell into the endless sea of trees below.</p><p>\u00a0 \u2018<i>Guys, we got a Vision situation here</i>,\u2019 Sam called through Steve\u2019s earpiece.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThat was Vision. We have to get to him,\u201d Steve said quickly to (Y/N), tugging on her hand towards the forest, but before he could relay that news over the intercom, her other hand fell onto his own, pulling it away from his ear.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNo, wait!\u201d She exclaimed, but quickly composed herself. \u201cSteve, I\u2019ve got this one. You stay here and fight. The team needs you down here. I\u2019ve got <g class=\"gr_ gr_623 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"623\" data-gr-id=\"623\">Vision</g>.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBut-\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Steve started, but (Y/N) kissed his cheek, letting her lips linger close to his ear.\u00a0\u201cStay here. I\u2019ve got this,\u201d she repeated. And, before he could argue, she was already gone, the last of her image disappearing into the shadows of the jungle.</p><p>\u00a0 Steve tried to turn away, he really did. He wanted to trust her, but there was something so\u2026off about what had just happened. The way she wouldn\u2019t kiss him (it was more likely that she would\u2019ve jumped his bones right there on the battlefield than her not kiss him at all), the way she giggled like a schoolgirl (yeah, right), and the way she wouldn\u2019t let him fight with her when they had <i>just </i>reunited. Everything felt fake. Forced. It was an act.</p><p>\u00a0 There were some things that couldn\u2019t be faked, and one of them was love.</p><p>\u00a0<i> That was not (Y/N),</i>\u00a0Steve realized with a striking jolt, pivoting on his heels away from the battlefield to follow whatever was taking the form of his fiancee.</p><hr><p>\u00a0 Branches clawed at (Y/N)\u2019s arms and legs, but she blew them aside with her magic, snapping entire trees in half to make way for her until she heard a struggle through the leaves. She ducked into the bushes, lithely making her way towards a clearing that opened up to a fight between Veronica (which she guessed was being controlled by Bruce) and one of Thanos\u2019s meathead minions, a creature that looked like an overcooked Ninja Turtle. The two threw punch after punch at each other in the pit of the waterfalls, tripping over themselves in the shallow river.</p><p>\u00a0 She watched for a moment until her Power Stone began to burn against her chest, signaling for her to keep moving as she was getting closer to her target. She grappled up the side of a small cliff to peer over a plane where Vision and another one of Thanos\u2019s minions were standing face-to-face just as Vision was knocked down to his knees. The black and gold cloaked minion towered over Vision with a bladed staff. (Y/N) almost stopped him, but thought better of it just as the blade sunk into Vision\u2019s chest with a guttural groan.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI thought you were a formidable machine,\u201d the minion growled, hovering Vision above the ground as his form began to flicker. \u201cBut you\u2019re dying like any man.\u201d Releasing the blade, the minion left Vision to crumble in a heap to the ground. But before he could strike again, (Y/N) sliced his head clean off. His torso fell to the side in a cloud of red dirt before a wide-eyed Vision who stared at the body, at (Y/N), then back at the body. The sorceress never even flinched.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThird time I\u2019ve beheaded someone in just over two days. Think there\u2019s a rehab for that?\u201d (Y/N) joked darkly as she twirled her blue-bloodied dagger, then replaced it in her holster. With a sigh, she extended her hand to Vision.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI suppose a thank you is in order, now,\u201d he laughed wearily as he leaned against her for support.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBetter be. I don\u2019t save just anybody, Mr. Robot. I have priorities, dammit.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWell, I am certainly glad to be one of them,\u201d Vision responded, groaning as his wound extended and contracted with every step he took. He knew he shouldn\u2019t be walking, but at least he had (Y/N) to fight for him now, despite the shudder that ran through him at what he had just seen her do. But he knew her, and more importantly, he trusted her as his girlfriend\u2019s best friend. At least he knew that was finally safe.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 However, through his increasingly fuzzy vision, he noticed they were trekking further into the jungle, the opposite direction of where they needed to go. He cleared his throat. \u201cMay I ask, though. Where are we walking to? I believe the main facility is back that way,\u201d he commented, looking over to (Y/N) who was staring straight ahead, her face no longer anything that he recognized as the sounds of Bruce\u2019s fight died down and the silence blanketed the heavy trees that surrounded them like prison bars.\u00a0\u201c(Y/N)?\u201d Vision asked her again. But the chill that greeted him froze him to the core just as his stone began to sear into his skull.</p><p>\u00a0 Suddenly, (Y/N) turned on Vision, but all she could focus on was the golden Mind Stone. It beckoned to her with tantalizing whispers of desire.</p><p>\u00a0 And finally, she understood Thanos\u2019s claim for destiny. No, she <i>felt</i> it. The stone was rightfully hers for the taking. It always had been. Thanos had just been the one to point it out to her.</p><p>\u00a0 Her own Power Stone seemed to call out to the Mind Stone as it burned furiously against her chest, making Vision wince in response as his eyes met with hers through the shadows of the brush.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI promise, this is nothing personal,\u201d (Y/N) said to him distantly as she shoved him to the ground. She encircled him, icy fingers trailing his neck as she rounded to face him, himself barely able to get to his knees.\u00a0\u201cJust something Thanos wants. And what Thanos wants\u2026\u201d she said, raising her hand towards the stone,\u00a0\u201cI get.\u201d And with her final snarl, she sent a beam of purple and silver light towards Vision, extracting a roar of anguish from his lips that burst through the treetops like the blares of an alarm.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 She could see the Mind Stone beginning to shift in his forehead, her vicious magic carving it out of his own head before her very eyes. From beyond the mind control, her confused and terrified <g class=\"gr_ gr_619 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling multiReplace\" id=\"619\" data-gr-id=\"619\">self felt</g> something shatter deep inside of her. Something that she couldn\u2019t understand or begin to define. Before that moment, she always believed that she was the most broken that she could ever be. There was nothing else dark enough to phase her any longer.</p><p>\u00a0 But she was wrong. So, painfully wrong.</p><p>\u00a0 Everything was more intense in those torturous seconds. The humidity from the scornful Sun. The roaring of the waterfalls. The screams of some alien creature. The unforgiving nature of her magic that was so cold, it burned.</p><p>\u00a0 But as soon as she saw the beginnings of exposed wiring, she heard a terrified voice shriek out her name.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201c(Y/N)!? What are you doing?\u201d Wanda cried, not able to believe the atrocity\u00a0before her, but she snapped out of it when she saw Vision\u2019s face. In her haste, she shot (Y/N) with a red spell that knocked her friend into a backward roll. Landing on her feet, (Y/N) snapped her head up to Wanda who rushed to Vision\u2019s aid, asking if he was okay as he fell limp into her arms.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m doing what\u2019s right for the Universe. Something you\u2019ve never been able to do,\u201d (Y/N) spit at her, not even bothering to conceal herself any longer, allowing the Sapphire of her mind control infiltrate her eyes with brutal intensity. Wanda watched (Y/N) with horror, finally understanding that what was stalking her was not her friend any longer.\u00a0\u201cEven when you tried, you still managed to kill eleven innocent people in a country you had no right to be in\u2026do<g class=\"gr_ gr_578 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"578\" data-gr-id=\"578\">n\u2019t</g> you feel disgusted with yourself for what you did? How can you even live with yourself? Murderer,\u201d she dragged out the words, the emphasis like dragging a dagger across Wanda\u2019s heart, slowly <g class=\"gr_ gr_577 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del\" id=\"577\" data-gr-id=\"577\">slicing</g> deeper and deeper each time she repeated it.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cStop,\u201d Wanda quivered, closing her eyes to the thoughts of that obscene day that haunted her every single night. But she couldn\u2019t shut them out this time.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cMurderer,\u201d (Y/N) continued to chant, crouching lower in her stance to launch herself at the witch, preparing for the kill.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t listen to her. She\u2019s baiting you, Wanda,\u201d Vision pleaded, pulling Wanda from her nightmares that (Y/N) was so clearly inducing, the red magic of the Reality Stone sparking off her own fingertips as the ice sorceress snarled at her.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHow can you trust yourself after losing control time and time again? The cycle just continues, Wanda. You use your powers, and people die. Maybe you were just born a bad omen. Born to cause death wherever you go\u2026and to whoever you grow close to. That reminds me\u2026how is Pietro doing these days?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Wanda stopped crying, her trembling body going still as her eyes flickered up to (Y/N), a rage like nothing she had ever seen filling the witch\u2019s eyes. Laying Vision against a stone, she stood protectively in front of him, her hands spiraling offensively in front of her as she stared down the imposter. (Y/N) just laughed.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cReally?\u201d she scoffed, throwing her hair over her shoulder.\u00a0\u201cPlease, Wanda. We both know that I\u2019m stronger than you. <i>Everyone</i> knows it. And I always have been.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBut I have more to lose,\u201d Wanda concluded through gritted teeth as she charged (Y/N) who dodged her first <g class=\"gr_ gr_594 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"594\" data-gr-id=\"594\">beam,</g> but got blasted into the trunk of an ancient tree that somehow held its ground on the second. Wanda tried to blast (Y/N) again, aiming for her heart to stun the sorceress, but, as predicted, (Y/N) was not only <g class=\"gr_ gr_593 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"593\" data-gr-id=\"593\">faster,</g> but much stronger. Holding off Wanda\u2019s beam as she began to walk towards the witch, her hands held firmly in front of her as she placed one foot in front of the other until she was almost nose-to-nose with Wanda where she slipped out of the beam, spinning to her left to elbow Wanda in the side of her head, sending the witch sprawling into the dirt. She attempted to stand her ground again, but (Y/N) swept her legs from under her and kicked her into a boulder where she smashed her head.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) walked over to where she lay, toeing the witch curiously, but her body lay still, red leather jacket frosted in wicked silver ice that curled in amethyst smoke, rising like the dead from a grave. With a satisfied smirk, (Y/N) crossed the plane to reach Vision, planning to finish her mission, but a body crashed into her, throwing her to the ground as he pinned her wrists to the dirt.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 His face was still beautiful despite the blood and ash that smeared his features, dusting his beard that had grown unkept in her absence. In her head, she begged him to run away, to get as far from her as possible before she\u2026before she did something that she would never be able to forgive herself for. Something so unthinkable\u2026but it wasn\u2019t unthinkable. It was right at her fingertips that were already glowing a dangerous shade of violet, daring him to test her any further. But of course, he did. And she hated him for it.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201c(Y/N)! Wake up!\u201d Steve ordered her, knocking the blade from her grasp before she could stab him, digging his knee into her chest.\u00a0\u201cCome back to me! You know me. You love me. Don\u2019t leave me here, (Y/N). Please.\u201d She rolled on top of him for a moment, but he pinned her back down again, hooking his foot behind her knee to slam her harder into the ground. \u201cYou\u2019re so much stronger than whatever\u2019s controlling you. You are (Y/N) (Y/L/N). And you\u2019re coming home with me because you are the fiercest person I\u2019ve ever met. You can beat this. You always have. Please! You have to wake up!\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 He begged her, kissing her forehead, her cheeks, her lips, but her eyes were distant. Blank. He didn\u2019t recognize them. They weren\u2019t hers. He shook her, the tears falling down his face onto her heaving chest, but it was hopeless. He knew what he had to do\u2026but he could never. He would rather die than do that.</p><p>\u00a0 His eyes shot up to hers as her lips began to move, a strangled voice attempting to escape the barriers. He waited, encouraging her to speak, but her eyes narrowed just as she found her voice, eyes flashing in an eerie shade of violet.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cGet off of me!\u201d she growled as she forced him off of her in an explosion of violet that careened him onto his back. She stood over him as she kicked him in the side like a wounded dog. Lifting her chin, she sneered at him distastefully.\u00a0\u201cWeak idiot. Even when you know that she\u2019s gone, you still can\u2019t bear to kill me. Pitiful. We need strong men and women in the next life. I hope the Snap wipes you out first. Call it Darwinian justice.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 And with her final words to him, she used her magic to throw him like a bullet through the trees. Hell knew where she threw him or if he survived, but she didn\u2019t care. She only turned back to Vision who was being caressed by Wanda, all color drained from her face as he pleaded with her to destroy the stone, but it was too late. (Y/N) was already prowling towards them, a predator, her aura of the same eerie violet light from her eyes surrounding her figure. She exuded power in its purest form. She was Power.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 Wanda tried to stop her one last time, stronger than the last, but she was cast aside once again. It was a hard fought battle, torturous to witness, but despairing in the end. There were flashes of battles between her versus Bucky, versus T\u2019Challa, versus Bruce, Natasha, Rhodey, Sam\u2026they all attempted to match her, but she was an avalanche rushing down a mountain. A winter storm against a ship in the middle of a raging sea. They came at her one at a time, but even if they worked together, it was hopeless. Maybe this was her destiny. Maybe Strange was wrong.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 No, he was wrong. She wasn\u2019t the hero in this story. She was never meant to be.</p><p>\u00a0 Grasping Vision with her magic, she ripped the last of the Mind Stone from his head with her bare hands, wires wrenched from their sockets with dying sparks as she dropped his gray, lifeless body to the ground like he was nothing. Not even a person. Just a means to Thanos\u2019s end.</p><p>\u00a0 Inside, (Y/N) couldn\u2019t stop replaying the image of his pleading eyes that dulled and rolled into the back of his head the moment she tore the stone from his skull, the way his last breath sounded as it escaped his lips, undoubtedly the most horrifying sound she had ever heard. She was a murderer. There was no mistaking it. She had just killed someone, someone she cared about, with her own bare hands. It was something she had never done before. It was\u2026it was\u2026</p><p>\u00a0 Beautiful. The Mind Stone glowed in a scintillating golden light brighter than the striking Sun, it\u2019s intensity an honor to behold. She couldn\u2019t believe that she was actually holding it. No dreams could compare. The key to Thanos\u2019s approval, the key to the balance of the Universe. She studied the gem carefully as it floated across her fingertips, noticing the tiny flecks of orange and red that twisted menacingly inside the crystal, knowing that the power was desperately searching for a release, ready to wreak havoc now that there was nobody to tame <g class=\"gr_ gr_592 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling multiReplace\" id=\"592\" data-gr-id=\"592\">it\u2019s</g> tantalizing power.</p><p>\u00a0 She was broken from her trance when the gem suddenly began to burn hotter than ever before, almost causing her to drop the damned thing when she heard the familiar thunder of an opening portal, feeling his presence take control of the very Earth she stood on. She turned her head to peer over her shoulder, watching Thanos step from his portal, flashing her the emerald Time Stone that gleamed on his gauntlet. She flashed him the Mind Stone in response, earning her a grin from his scarred face, claw marks grazing down his cheeks in daunting memories. But it had all been worth it when he approached (Y/N), her knee beginning to bend in his presence, but he held her chin instead, making her look his dead in the eye.</p><p>\u00a0 \u201cYou must not bow, my child, for you have done the Universe an exceptional service today that will span for many long generations,\u201d Thanos announced to her proudly. \u201cYou will forever be remembered for your bravery, for you are the only one of my loyal servants to have not failed me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI would never, Father,\u201d (Y/N) responded submissively, but held her head up high to Thanos, like a soldier receiving\u00a0the most morbid Medal of Honor to have ever been given. Absolute mutiny.</p><p>\u00a0 Everyone was forced to watch from the outskirts of (Y/N)\u2019s shield that surrounded herself and Thanos as she handed him the stone. Nothing could stop the disgusted grimace that bubbled up from deep inside Steve\u2019s core when the name\u00a0\u201cFather\u201d spilled from (Y/N)\u2019s lips. It was so casual, he almost believed her. But it wasn\u2019t her. That thing just looked like her. But it didn\u2019t make what he was forced to watch any easier to digest. He wasn\u2019t sure if he would ever be able to truly swallow it down. Not that he had the time to do so anyway.</p><p>\u00a0 Thanos grasped the Mind Stone from (Y/N)\u2019s fingertips, slamming the crystal into his gauntlet to complete his collection, the electrifying jolts of magic racing through his veins in vibrant colors. (Y/N) could feel the power surge through her own veins as she felt his hand rest on her shoulder. She breathed it in like oxygen. It was better than oxygen. Intoxicating.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 But the connection was sliced off by the blade of an ax that buried itself into Thanos\u2019s wide chest, purple blood spurting from the gaping wound as the forcefield that surrounded them dissipated into thin air. Thor landed next to (Y/N), preparing for a fight, but Thanos waved her off. She stood to his side as a sentry, a neutral expression painted on her face as Thor grabbed the back of Thanos\u2019s head and the hilt of his ax, burying it deeper into Thanos\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u00a0 \u201cI told you, you\u2019d die for that,\u201d Thor avowed, vengeance set in his immovable expression. He had made good on his threat, watching as his brother\u2019s murderer roared in pain, lolling his head to the side when Thor ceased the ax. Thanos began mumbling something, his words disjointed by his dying breaths\u2026or so Thor believed. But (Y/N) knew better. He wouldn\u2019t have waved her off if the bastard didn\u2019t have a plan.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou\u2026you should have gone for the head,\u201d Thanos growled as he shoved Thor away from him, ripping the ax from his body as he snatched (Y/N) roughly by the shoulder, absorbing her powers into his gauntlet as his Power Stone completed. And with a final haunting grin towards his audience, he snapped his fingers and the Sun had finally seemed to have had enough as the world went blind, only Thor\u2019s lasting howl echoing in the back of everyone\u2019s minds.</p><p>\u00a0 When the world returned to Steve\u2019s vision, all he saw was (Y/N) as her body hit the ground. He wasn\u2019t fast enough to catch her, but he lunged to reach her, trying to find a pulse that wasn\u2019t there. He gently brushed the flyaways from her face, tracing her bruised and scarred cheeks that were devoid of any color. He tucked her into his chest, rocking slowly back and forth on the forest floor in disbelief, not wanting to accept what had just happened. Who he was holding.</p><p>\u00a0 This wasn\u2019t how it was supposed to be. This wasn\u2019t right. They should have been home by then, embracing each other in bed after a sound night of sleep. He was supposed to be looking into her eyes, getting lost in the plans of their future together. The endless possibilities they were supposed to share.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 But reality was cruel. No, he wouldn\u2019t accept it. His mind reeled back to the events of the last few days, but nothing made sense. Nothing mattered anymore. Everything felt meaningless as he pulled her closer to his chest, burying his face in her hair.</p><p>\u00a0 All he could do was choke out strangled\u00a0\u2018I love you\u2019s into the deafening silence. He had no prayers left. She had been his last, and only one.</p><p>\u00a0 Thor stared in shock at Steve and (Y/N), watching the life leave Steve just as it had (Y/N). His teammates, friends, family, people he thought he would spend the rest of his life with. He understood the abhorrent depths of what Steve was feeling, distinguishing the dull pain that shrouded his friend\u2019s eyes as it had his own when he laid over Loki\u2019s body. And everything came full circle as his eyes met the smoking gauntlet on Thanos\u2019s hand, the entire thing melted and charred in black ash, a foretelling of the next disturbing minutes to come.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d Thor shouted at him in desperation.\u00a0\u201cWhat did you do?!\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 But all Thanos did was backhand Thor across the plane, striding over to where (Y/N) lay in Steve\u2019s arms, determined to retrieve his perfect weapon. Steve fought Thanos, fought him harder than he\u2019d ever fought for anything, standing over (Y/N) as Thanos bore his full weight on the grieving Super Soldier. Steve gritted his teeth, his arms giving way to the massive Mad Titan that threatened to crush him and take all that he had left of her. He couldn\u2019t understand it. But she was really gone now. She was really\u2026</p><p>\u00a0 Thanos swatted Steve aside, finally reaching (Y/N)\u2019s body that he carefully caressed in his arms, giving one last prideful look towards Thor before he stepped back into his portal, disappearing from the horrors that he cast upon the Universe.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 Steve awoke a moment after Thanos left, scrambling to his feet as he called (Y/N)\u2019s name. With a heavy heart, Bucky held his friend, trying to calm him down, but Steve pushed Bucky off of him. Limping towards Thor, he repeated hollowly,\u00a0\u201cwhere is he? Where did he take her? Thor, where\u2019d he go?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 Thor had no response for him. He wished that he had any words, anything at all to console Steve, but he didn\u2019t. He had nothing. Everything he had worked <g class=\"gr_ gr_617 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"617\" data-gr-id=\"617\">for</g> to get the ax. Nedavelir. Taking on the force of a fucking star. None of it made a difference. And just like Steve, Thor felt that everything was meaningless. Half his people were slaughtered, now with Heimdall, Loki, and (Y/N). What more could Thanos take from him? The Mad Titan had ruined him.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSteve?\u201d Bucky called out, finally getting Steve\u2019s attention just as his body crashed into a flurry of gray ash. Steve stumbled towards his best friend, but again, he was too late. He knelt down beside the ash, placing a trembling hand onto the ground where Bucky had just been, but\u2026the numbness suddenly returned. It was so striking that Steve\u2019s knees finally gave out beneath him as he stared from Thor to the ground. There was an emptiness in them. Like looking at a corpse.</p><p>\u00a0 He heard light footsteps race behind him, registering them as Natasha\u2019s before she placed her hand on his shoulder, her other hand pressed to her stomach, her mouth agape as she caught sight of Vision\u2019s dead body. But Steve could barely feel her attempt at comfort. He could only stare at where Bucky had been.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhat is this? What the hell is happening?\u201d Rhodey tried to ask Thor, but Thor was just as speechless as Natasha, Bruce, and Rocket, not one being able to rationalize what Thanos had just done.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOh, God,\u201d was Steve\u2019s only response, a shard of ice buried in his heart.</p><hr><p><b>D I S T A N T \u00a0- \u00a0P L A N E T</b></p><p><b>\u00a0</b> She awoke to the soft sunlight of dawn, the moment just as the Sun broke the boundaries of the horizon to begin a new day.</p><p>\u00a0 But what was the point anymore? What is a new day when half the Universe had just been slaughtered? She felt like she was frozen, like time couldn\u2019t go on until everything returned to the way it was just after the Avengers saved New York. After possibilities arose, and the word\u00a0\u201cheroes\u201d actually had a meaning to her. When anything had a\u00a0meaning to her.</p><p>\u00a0 All she could remember was a flash of Steve dissolving in the shadows of the jungle, the blinding gold of the Mind Stone, and Vision\u2019s hollow eye sockets.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 She didn\u2019t want to open her eyes. She didn\u2019t want to wake to a world where Steve could possibly be gone. Where her family was dead\u2026again. In a Universe where she was responsible for severing the lifelines of half the people in it. She couldn\u2019t decide if it would be better or worse to know who had survived and who had\u2026But the voice that she dreaded cut through her core like steel grating iron.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSo, she finally wakes,\u201d Thanos proclaimed into the sunrise, basking in its welcoming glow that brought promises of a bright future for the Universe he had just rescued. His destiny had been met. But, there was still one loose end he had to tie up before everything was settled. Without looking behind him, he felt (Y/N) stand from her cot, striding calmly to the front of their wooden shack on the edge of a viridescent landscape that sprawled over miles and miles of luscious hills that sprouted millions of trees. She heard the wild call of a lonesome bird, its one-note song solidifying something heavy in her chest. Stars hung faintly in the dawning sky beside a low hovering moon, it\u2019s surface so close, (Y/N) felt like if she strained enough on her toes, she could poke one of its craters, hopefully, fall inside one and never come out again.</p><p>\u00a0 Wherever this serene place was, it was a stone-cold liar. A deceiving land that attempted to replace beauty with the agony that Thanos had caused that would ripple across generations like a hurricane causing tsunamis in every surrounding country it could reach. This place disgusted (Y/N), but she couldn\u2019t turn away from the rising sun, furious at its audacity to continue to rise, and for time to continue to move forward. It was an outrage against humanity.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou did it, didn\u2019t you?\u201d (Y/N) whispered calmly, a deathly calm that didn\u2019t surprise Thanos, but still left him with a grave chill as she sat beside him.</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) already knew the answer to her question. She could feel it in her bones. But she had to hear it stated out loud to fully believe it. She had to.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhat other reason would I have to be here enjoying the sunrise?\u201d he answered, leaning back to take in the warmth as he closed his eyes, fully content in the experience he had dreamed of for decades.</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) wasn\u2019t having that.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDoes it feel as satisfying without her here?\u201d she whispered coldly, her gaze fixed on the cattails that swayed mournfully in the breeze, only their brushes across the long grasses filling the sullen silence.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou remind me of her, you know,\u201d Thanos finally said, evading her heartwrenching question to test the waters.\u00a0\u201cShe was brave like you. A fearsome fighter\u2026I may not have her with me any longer, but I do have you.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 The wrath that was seething beneath her calm exterior finally broke as she ripped a large stake of wood from the ceiling, projecting it into his bicep where it buried itself into his muscle with a sickening crunch. He just stared at it passively, withdrawing it from his flesh like a woodchip as he tossed it from hand to hand. (Y/N) still refused to look at him, but her eyes had grown much darker with a lust for blood.</p><p>\u00a0 Yet her magic was depleted. The Power Stone was destroyed. All she had left was her boiling rage and hunger for vengeance as her fingers curled into fists atop her knees.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou don\u2019t <i>have</i> me,\u201d (Y/N) sneered. \u201cI\u2019m not yours to have. The stones are gone, you rapacious sadist. You know that you can\u2019t control me otherwise\u2026so why even try?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Thanos could see through her hateful words like shattering glass, see the pain that was slowly eating her alive. He knew that she was goading him into killing her. Not able to handle the guilt of what she believed to be murder. And <g class=\"gr_ gr_579 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"579\" data-gr-id=\"579\">her</g> wish, she would finally receive because she was right. He would never be able to break her far enough to become his new right hand. Never.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThere was a time when I had the utmost faith in you, (Y/N),\u201d Thanos ranted as he stood above her. \u201cA time when I could see the opportunities\u00a0for us together as clear as this beautiful day rising before us. But it seems like our time together must be cut short, unfortunately. I once thought you were the only one who could carry out what needs to be done from this day forward, but it appears that another may be able to take your place.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) froze at that admission. He had more plans beyond the Snap. She felt dizzy at the thought of how stupid she had been, believing that somehow after this was all over that he would be satisfied. But a power-hungry madman like himself would never be satisfied. It was just in his nature.</p><p>\u00a0 She tried to make a move to run, but he caught her by the neck, anticipating her escape.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDespite how you\u2019ve portrayed yourself over the last few years, you always somehow return to your roots: a runaway. Hiding from your fears when they finally get the best of you. You wear a nice mask, but it runs in your blood,\u201d he growled at her as she struggled in his grasp.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 But then she saw it. A shard of amethyst light buried in the wound on his wrist. It was small, and probably not what she thought it was, but she had a shimmer of slim hope that wedged its way into her veins, forcing her fingers to reach towards the lustrous fragment that she could have sworn had winked at her.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cStill, I may come to regret this decision. You would have been my crowning jewel to a now worthy empire\u2026but I doubt it,\u201d Thanos declared as he grabbed ahold of a gleaming silver sword, aiming the blade towards her heart.\u00a0\u201cMay you go in peace, my child,\u201d he said to her just as her fingers grasped the shard of amethyst, her intentions going to a portal, willing it to appear behind her. But instead, she felt the freezing cold blade impale her gut, narrowly dodging her heart when she lurched in his grasp. Yet, the pain wasn\u2019t any less intense, digging around her insides like a living being as Thanos glared her down.</p><p>\u00a0 She glared back at him with piercing silver eyes that gave him whiplash as he struggled for understanding. He just barely glanced at the amethyst fragment she was clutching in her bloody fingers before a portal opened behind her, exactly where her mind had wielded it. She gave him one last victorious smile before she shoved herself off of his blade, the sharp edge grazing vital organs in her body before she let herself fall into the endless void, ignoring the sinking feeling that pulled her towards the desire to end it all. The only thing she could hear was the violent, bloodthirsty roars of Thanos that echoed around her, but even those faded as she fell down\u2026down\u2026down the rabbit hole. Now, all she could hear was the whistling of the wind whip past her freezing cold ears. Everything was getting colder as her breath became a struggle. But she decided to struggle.</p><p>\u00a0 Maybe there was one thing that still gave her life meaning after all.</p><p>\u00a0 Revenge.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b> \u00a0<g class=\"gr_ gr_563 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del\" id=\"563\" data-gr-id=\"563\">T O</g> \u00a0- \u00a0B E \u00a0- \u00a0C O N T I N U E D</b></p><p><b>T A G S</b>: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlSoQ-tzWXqmHBQjEOwnDYg\">@benedrylcumbersnatch</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mR0IW7pRRTlGjpaBZzLfoVw\">@daniellajocelyn</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYlu0CG6g0HV126mDX5EUAA\">@shannonr2003</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muXrTh8-Cv3mjVDxjEs3Ktg\">@ever-so-slightly-below-average</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKJ5sTXat_3jOUb9CtnlJjw\">@mysteriouslysharkbait</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mt6uzR8mKp99MC6sWbfZb_w\">@sireennotsiren</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDkKVCSpAX6qq9iDj5NKJLw\">@pluvialday</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/me4cXs-LqZjfS_X4AiYJsiQ\">@thenogravity</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjfaeGdUxkUDrEfygL1CdqQ\">@iiicurlingwavesiii</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtifdrf4Wv9zh77_HIw6Rng\">@i-only-signed-up-for-fanfiction</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUxwWE4gjyaVLsK28-QE45Q\">@introvertedsin</a></p><p>**Updates: And that\u2019s the end of Part 7, my loves! Fuck me, that was a lot. I went back and forth on whether this should be the end of the series and the reader should just die, but\u2026I enjoy the struggle too much apparently so I will return again with (possibly the final) Part 8 when the last film comes out. Thinking I\u2019ll continue after that with some fluff chapters with homely Avengers far in the future starting families and stuff, but we\u2019ll see (maybe even create an alternate ending if Marvel goes all emo on us). I hope y\u2019all have enjoyed my heartache because\u00a0if anyone knows anything about fanfiction, the pain is all a part of the process, but I really am happy with the results so far. In the meantime, I think I\u2019m gonna take a short break from Tumblr just to relax my aching brain. This doesn\u2019t mean that my blog will be dead over the next few months. If anyone has any requests, I\u2019d be so fucking honored to take them on as well as finish some of my other unfinished projects (including an overly ambitious Harry Potter Fem!Slytherin Reader series if anyone\u2019s interested). Thank you all again for the support and I\u2019ll be back as soon as I can!</p><p>**Please don\u2019t forget to follow and hit that notification button to make sure that you don\u2019t miss a damn thing if you like my shit. Everyone knows that tagging has gone to hell, so I think I\u2019m gonna disband my tag list until Tumblr gets a grip (but I doubt it).

Falling down her rabbit hole didn\u2019t lead (Y/N) to breathtaking lands of shit-talking flowers and fantastical adventures with hookah smoking caterpillars. No. Her reality was much darker. The hole that she fell through left her more dazed and confused than Alice had ever been.<br></p><p>\u00a0 With her hair\u00a0whipping past her face, she wished bitterly that Lewis Carroll had written her life\u2019s story. At least then she might be able to do some shrooms to staunch the pain and help her to forget\u2026forget everything. She didn\u2019t want to remember what she had done. She just wanted to disappear.</p><hr><p>\u00a0<b>W A K A N D A</b></p><p><b>\u00a0 </b>Nothing could have prepared Steve for the hellish creatures that charged the open barrier. It was the bloodiest war he had ever seen, and that was saying a lot. Even with Wanda and a special appearance by Thor to aid them, the battle left them gruesomely outnumbered to the deranged beasts that continued to pour in endless droves from the extraterrestrial ships like the bursting of several angry hornet\u2019s nests all at once.</p><p>\u00a0 He had hardly a moment to breathe between the slaughter of one creature before another one, or two, or five were on top of him again, wicked teeth and jagged claws slashing at every inch of skin they could gouge. He couldn\u2019t help the guttural fear that grasped him as he stared down the gullet of the beast that struck him to the ground, drips of blood and slobber spilled over him as the darkness became overpowering despite the blinding daylight that sweltered the battlefield in sickening heat.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 But before the beast could rip his head off, he felt the relief of its weight lifted from his ragged body, managing to lift his head enough to see Bucky wrestle the thing to the ground with the final stab of his oversized hunting knife as T\u2019Challa distracted the other two, slashing furiously with his own vibranium\u00a0claws. Bucky extended Steve his hand, patting his friend heavily on the back.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNever thought I\u2019d wish for the forties again,\u201c Bucky sighed as he retrieved his fallen gun, taking a moment to not pass out. He also never thought until that moment that he would ever have to wonder what his own personal hell would look like\u2026but this wretched place was giving Hydra a run for its blood money.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNever thought I\u2019d be grateful for you saving my ass again,\u201d Steve responded breathlessly, punching Bucky in the shoulder who smiled back at him.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cComes with the job, pal,\u201d Bucky winked before charging back into the thick of the battle. Steve watched him go until he felt a presence\u00a0behind him, where he backflipped over the beast that tried to tackle him, but Steve was quicker. He tried not to think of the sticky blood that drowned his boots as he stepped from the creature\u2019s skull to continue his fight.</p><p>\u00a0 The Sun was a curse on the land, seeming to burn with a vendetta against the treachery that it was forced to witness over it\u2019s ancient, green Earth. It was an absolute mutiny. Despite the legendary beauty Wakanda had once held, it was now torn by the foulest of smells and the rotten spoils of war.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 But there was a sudden shift. A breeze blew past Steve, sending familiar chills down his spine as he turned towards the direction of the refreshing, northern wind. He wanted to believe it was her, that she had come back, but he would not give in to his foolish hopes. He needed to know for sure. He needed to see\u2026</p><p>\u00a0 The battlefield parted around a thundercloud portal, shadows twisting sinisterly from beneath the smoke that rose and fell with a malevolent life of its own as blue lightning flashed within its depths. But he was transfixed on the dark figure that stepped from the portal, her ethereal beauty and undeniable power knocking the last remnants of breath he had been holding from his gasping lungs. It was like he always teased her: <i>how can someone be so damn addicting?</i></p><p><i>\u00a0 </i>She always had a snarky comment to follow his question, of course. And that was one of the millions of reasons why he loved her, and why his feet naturally gravitated towards her after his initial state of shock, desperate to hold her in his arms again. Wanting to apologize for ever letting her slip out of his hands, to begin with, and to promise that it would never happen again.</p><p>\u00a0 He was so spellbound by her presence that he hadn\u2019t bothered to notice the feral beast that launched itself towards him, fangs bared to sink into his neck. But by the time he caught sight of the creature from his periphery, it was already too late. Throwing up his arms to protect himself, he waited for the fatal slash of claws that never came. Peering over his defenses, he saw the beast writhing on the ground with a silver ice katana buried deep into its own neck.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 His head whipped back towards (Y/N), her eyes consumed by a haunting sapphire\u00a0light that flickered out as soon as she saw him. She narrowed her eyes at him a moment, then allowed a huge smile to brighten her features that glowed in the now tolerable sunlight. They both crossed the field to each other, (Y/N) not even looking at the beasts before they burst into amethyst flames.</p><p>\u00a0 And Steve couldn\u2019t help but wonder: <i>How had she gotten so much more powerful in so little time? </i>But as soon as she jumped into his arms, all worries melted from his mind, dissolving into the overwhelming feeling of relief. He squeezed her tight, whispering\u00a0\u2018I love you\u2019 into the crook of her neck as he kissed the top of her head, noticing the strands of white that decorated her {your color} hair, but forgot as soon as she pulled away, revealing the <g class=\"gr_ gr_614 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del\" id=\"614\" data-gr-id=\"614\">face</g> that he had missed more than anything he\u2019d ever missed in his life. Overcome by her presence, he tried to lean in for a kiss, but her face dropped as she threw her hand over his lips. His brows furrowed as she giggled playfully.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cLook, you can kiss me until I\u2019m blue in the face once this is all over, Captain,\u201d she purred, pursing her lips seductively as she leaned closer to him.\u00a0\u201cBut first, I need to know where Vision is.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Steve pulled her hand into his own as he laughed at his own distraction.\u00a0\u201cAnd finally we\u2019ve reached the day where\u00a0<i>you\u2019re</i> the one more focused on the mission than <i>me</i>,\u201d he teased her, kissing her hand that she cupped around his cheek before it fell away, her impatience getting the better of her.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSteve, there isn\u2019t time for this. Tell me where Vision is, now\u2026please,\u201d she added politely at the end.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYeah\u2026yeah, of course,\u201d Steve nodded as he pointed towards a large, grey building that was built into the luscious cliffside. Raging waterfalls spilled from the end of the jungle like tears rushing from the crystal clear skies, a startling comparison to the massacre below its tranquility. Just as he began to speak again, they both caught sight of two figures breaking out of one of the windows where they fell into the endless sea of trees below.</p><p>\u00a0 \u2018<i>Guys, we got a Vision situation here</i>,\u2019 Sam called through Steve\u2019s earpiece.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThat was Vision. We have to get to him,\u201d Steve said quickly to (Y/N), tugging on her hand towards the forest, but before he could relay that news over the intercom, her other hand fell onto his own, pulling it away from his ear.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNo, wait!\u201d She exclaimed, but quickly composed herself. \u201cSteve, I\u2019ve got this one. You stay here and fight. The team needs you down here. I\u2019ve got <g class=\"gr_ gr_623 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"623\" data-gr-id=\"623\">Vision</g>.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBut-\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Steve started, but (Y/N) kissed his cheek, letting her lips linger close to his ear.\u00a0\u201cStay here. I\u2019ve got this,\u201d she repeated. And, before he could argue, she was already gone, the last of her image disappearing into the shadows of the jungle.</p><p>\u00a0 Steve tried to turn away, he really did. He wanted to trust her, but there was something so\u2026off about what had just happened. The way she wouldn\u2019t kiss him (it was more likely that she would\u2019ve jumped his bones right there on the battlefield than her not kiss him at all), the way she giggled like a schoolgirl (yeah, right), and the way she wouldn\u2019t let him fight with her when they had <i>just </i>reunited. Everything felt fake. Forced. It was an act.</p><p>\u00a0 There were some things that couldn\u2019t be faked, and one of them was love.</p><p>\u00a0<i> That was not (Y/N),</i>\u00a0Steve realized with a striking jolt, pivoting on his heels away from the battlefield to follow whatever was taking the form of his fiancee.</p><hr><p>\u00a0 Branches clawed at (Y/N)\u2019s arms and legs, but she blew them aside with her magic, snapping entire trees in half to make way for her until she heard a struggle through the leaves. She ducked into the bushes, lithely making her way towards a clearing that opened up to a fight between Veronica (which she guessed was being controlled by Bruce) and one of Thanos\u2019s meathead minions, a creature that looked like an overcooked Ninja Turtle. The two threw punch after punch at each other in the pit of the waterfalls, tripping over themselves in the shallow river.</p><p>\u00a0 She watched for a moment until her Power Stone began to burn against her chest, signaling for her to keep moving as she was getting closer to her target. She grappled up the side of a small cliff to peer over a plane where Vision and another one of Thanos\u2019s minions were standing face-to-face just as Vision was knocked down to his knees. The black and gold cloaked minion towered over Vision with a bladed staff. (Y/N) almost stopped him, but thought better of it just as the blade sunk into Vision\u2019s chest with a guttural groan.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI thought you were a formidable machine,\u201d the minion growled, hovering Vision above the ground as his form began to flicker. \u201cBut you\u2019re dying like any man.\u201d Releasing the blade, the minion left Vision to crumble in a heap to the ground. But before he could strike again, (Y/N) sliced his head clean off. His torso fell to the side in a cloud of red dirt before a wide-eyed Vision who stared at the body, at (Y/N), then back at the body. The sorceress never even flinched.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThird time I\u2019ve beheaded someone in just over two days. Think there\u2019s a rehab for that?\u201d (Y/N) joked darkly as she twirled her blue-bloodied dagger, then replaced it in her holster. With a sigh, she extended her hand to Vision.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI suppose a thank you is in order, now,\u201d he laughed wearily as he leaned against her for support.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBetter be. I don\u2019t save just anybody, Mr. Robot. I have priorities, dammit.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWell, I am certainly glad to be one of them,\u201d Vision responded, groaning as his wound extended and contracted with every step he took. He knew he shouldn\u2019t be walking, but at least he had (Y/N) to fight for him now, despite the shudder that ran through him at what he had just seen her do. But he knew her, and more importantly, he trusted her as his girlfriend\u2019s best friend. At least he knew that was finally safe.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 However, through his increasingly fuzzy vision, he noticed they were trekking further into the jungle, the opposite direction of where they needed to go. He cleared his throat. \u201cMay I ask, though. Where are we walking to? I believe the main facility is back that way,\u201d he commented, looking over to (Y/N) who was staring straight ahead, her face no longer anything that he recognized as the sounds of Bruce\u2019s fight died down and the silence blanketed the heavy trees that surrounded them like prison bars.\u00a0\u201c(Y/N)?\u201d Vision asked her again. But the chill that greeted him froze him to the core just as his stone began to sear into his skull.</p><p>\u00a0 Suddenly, (Y/N) turned on Vision, but all she could focus on was the golden Mind Stone. It beckoned to her with tantalizing whispers of desire.</p><p>\u00a0 And finally, she understood Thanos\u2019s claim for destiny. No, she <i>felt</i> it. The stone was rightfully hers for the taking. It always had been. Thanos had just been the one to point it out to her.</p><p>\u00a0 Her own Power Stone seemed to call out to the Mind Stone as it burned furiously against her chest, making Vision wince in response as his eyes met with hers through the shadows of the brush.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI promise, this is nothing personal,\u201d (Y/N) said to him distantly as she shoved him to the ground. She encircled him, icy fingers trailing his neck as she rounded to face him, himself barely able to get to his knees.\u00a0\u201cJust something Thanos wants. And what Thanos wants\u2026\u201d she said, raising her hand towards the stone,\u00a0\u201cI get.\u201d And with her final snarl, she sent a beam of purple and silver light towards Vision, extracting a roar of anguish from his lips that burst through the treetops like the blares of an alarm.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 She could see the Mind Stone beginning to shift in his forehead, her vicious magic carving it out of his own head before her very eyes. From beyond the mind control, her confused and terrified <g class=\"gr_ gr_619 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling multiReplace\" id=\"619\" data-gr-id=\"619\">self felt</g> something shatter deep inside of her. Something that she couldn\u2019t understand or begin to define. Before that moment, she always believed that she was the most broken that she could ever be. There was nothing else dark enough to phase her any longer.</p><p>\u00a0 But she was wrong. So, painfully wrong.</p><p>\u00a0 Everything was more intense in those torturous seconds. The humidity from the scornful Sun. The roaring of the waterfalls. The screams of some alien creature. The unforgiving nature of her magic that was so cold, it burned.</p><p>\u00a0 But as soon as she saw the beginnings of exposed wiring, she heard a terrified voice shriek out her name.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201c(Y/N)!? What are you doing?\u201d Wanda cried, not able to believe the atrocity\u00a0before her, but she snapped out of it when she saw Vision\u2019s face. In her haste, she shot (Y/N) with a red spell that knocked her friend into a backward roll. Landing on her feet, (Y/N) snapped her head up to Wanda who rushed to Vision\u2019s aid, asking if he was okay as he fell limp into her arms.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m doing what\u2019s right for the Universe. Something you\u2019ve never been able to do,\u201d (Y/N) spit at her, not even bothering to conceal herself any longer, allowing the Sapphire of her mind control infiltrate her eyes with brutal intensity. Wanda watched (Y/N) with horror, finally understanding that what was stalking her was not her friend any longer.\u00a0\u201cEven when you tried, you still managed to kill eleven innocent people in a country you had no right to be in\u2026do<g class=\"gr_ gr_578 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"578\" data-gr-id=\"578\">n\u2019t</g> you feel disgusted with yourself for what you did? How can you even live with yourself? Murderer,\u201d she dragged out the words, the emphasis like dragging a dagger across Wanda\u2019s heart, slowly <g class=\"gr_ gr_577 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del\" id=\"577\" data-gr-id=\"577\">slicing</g> deeper and deeper each time she repeated it.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cStop,\u201d Wanda quivered, closing her eyes to the thoughts of that obscene day that haunted her every single night. But she couldn\u2019t shut them out this time.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cMurderer,\u201d (Y/N) continued to chant, crouching lower in her stance to launch herself at the witch, preparing for the kill.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t listen to her. She\u2019s baiting you, Wanda,\u201d Vision pleaded, pulling Wanda from her nightmares that (Y/N) was so clearly inducing, the red magic of the Reality Stone sparking off her own fingertips as the ice sorceress snarled at her.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHow can you trust yourself after losing control time and time again? The cycle just continues, Wanda. You use your powers, and people die. Maybe you were just born a bad omen. Born to cause death wherever you go\u2026and to whoever you grow close to. That reminds me\u2026how is Pietro doing these days?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Wanda stopped crying, her trembling body going still as her eyes flickered up to (Y/N), a rage like nothing she had ever seen filling the witch\u2019s eyes. Laying Vision against a stone, she stood protectively in front of him, her hands spiraling offensively in front of her as she stared down the imposter. (Y/N) just laughed.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cReally?\u201d she scoffed, throwing her hair over her shoulder.\u00a0\u201cPlease, Wanda. We both know that I\u2019m stronger than you. <i>Everyone</i> knows it. And I always have been.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBut I have more to lose,\u201d Wanda concluded through gritted teeth as she charged (Y/N) who dodged her first <g class=\"gr_ gr_594 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"594\" data-gr-id=\"594\">beam,</g> but got blasted into the trunk of an ancient tree that somehow held its ground on the second. Wanda tried to blast (Y/N) again, aiming for her heart to stun the sorceress, but, as predicted, (Y/N) was not only <g class=\"gr_ gr_593 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"593\" data-gr-id=\"593\">faster,</g> but much stronger. Holding off Wanda\u2019s beam as she began to walk towards the witch, her hands held firmly in front of her as she placed one foot in front of the other until she was almost nose-to-nose with Wanda where she slipped out of the beam, spinning to her left to elbow Wanda in the side of her head, sending the witch sprawling into the dirt. She attempted to stand her ground again, but (Y/N) swept her legs from under her and kicked her into a boulder where she smashed her head.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) walked over to where she lay, toeing the witch curiously, but her body lay still, red leather jacket frosted in wicked silver ice that curled in amethyst smoke, rising like the dead from a grave. With a satisfied smirk, (Y/N) crossed the plane to reach Vision, planning to finish her mission, but a body crashed into her, throwing her to the ground as he pinned her wrists to the dirt.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 His face was still beautiful despite the blood and ash that smeared his features, dusting his beard that had grown unkept in her absence. In her head, she begged him to run away, to get as far from her as possible before she\u2026before she did something that she would never be able to forgive herself for. Something so unthinkable\u2026but it wasn\u2019t unthinkable. It was right at her fingertips that were already glowing a dangerous shade of violet, daring him to test her any further. But of course, he did. And she hated him for it.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201c(Y/N)! Wake up!\u201d Steve ordered her, knocking the blade from her grasp before she could stab him, digging his knee into her chest.\u00a0\u201cCome back to me! You know me. You love me. Don\u2019t leave me here, (Y/N). Please.\u201d She rolled on top of him for a moment, but he pinned her back down again, hooking his foot behind her knee to slam her harder into the ground. \u201cYou\u2019re so much stronger than whatever\u2019s controlling you. You are (Y/N) (Y/L/N). And you\u2019re coming home with me because you are the fiercest person I\u2019ve ever met. You can beat this. You always have. Please! You have to wake up!\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 He begged her, kissing her forehead, her cheeks, her lips, but her eyes were distant. Blank. He didn\u2019t recognize them. They weren\u2019t hers. He shook her, the tears falling down his face onto her heaving chest, but it was hopeless. He knew what he had to do\u2026but he could never. He would rather die than do that.</p><p>\u00a0 His eyes shot up to hers as her lips began to move, a strangled voice attempting to escape the barriers. He waited, encouraging her to speak, but her eyes narrowed just as she found her voice, eyes flashing in an eerie shade of violet.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cGet off of me!\u201d she growled as she forced him off of her in an explosion of violet that careened him onto his back. She stood over him as she kicked him in the side like a wounded dog. Lifting her chin, she sneered at him distastefully.\u00a0\u201cWeak idiot. Even when you know that she\u2019s gone, you still can\u2019t bear to kill me. Pitiful. We need strong men and women in the next life. I hope the Snap wipes you out first. Call it Darwinian justice.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 And with her final words to him, she used her magic to throw him like a bullet through the trees. Hell knew where she threw him or if he survived, but she didn\u2019t care. She only turned back to Vision who was being caressed by Wanda, all color drained from her face as he pleaded with her to destroy the stone, but it was too late. (Y/N) was already prowling towards them, a predator, her aura of the same eerie violet light from her eyes surrounding her figure. She exuded power in its purest form. She was Power.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 Wanda tried to stop her one last time, stronger than the last, but she was cast aside once again. It was a hard fought battle, torturous to witness, but despairing in the end. There were flashes of battles between her versus Bucky, versus T\u2019Challa, versus Bruce, Natasha, Rhodey, Sam\u2026they all attempted to match her, but she was an avalanche rushing down a mountain. A winter storm against a ship in the middle of a raging sea. They came at her one at a time, but even if they worked together, it was hopeless. Maybe this was her destiny. Maybe Strange was wrong.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 No, he was wrong. She wasn\u2019t the hero in this story. She was never meant to be.</p><p>\u00a0 Grasping Vision with her magic, she ripped the last of the Mind Stone from his head with her bare hands, wires wrenched from their sockets with dying sparks as she dropped his gray, lifeless body to the ground like he was nothing. Not even a person. Just a means to Thanos\u2019s end.</p><p>\u00a0 Inside, (Y/N) couldn\u2019t stop replaying the image of his pleading eyes that dulled and rolled into the back of his head the moment she tore the stone from his skull, the way his last breath sounded as it escaped his lips, undoubtedly the most horrifying sound she had ever heard. She was a murderer. There was no mistaking it. She had just killed someone, someone she cared about, with her own bare hands. It was something she had never done before. It was\u2026it was\u2026</p><p>\u00a0 Beautiful. The Mind Stone glowed in a scintillating golden light brighter than the striking Sun, it\u2019s intensity an honor to behold. She couldn\u2019t believe that she was actually holding it. No dreams could compare. The key to Thanos\u2019s approval, the key to the balance of the Universe. She studied the gem carefully as it floated across her fingertips, noticing the tiny flecks of orange and red that twisted menacingly inside the crystal, knowing that the power was desperately searching for a release, ready to wreak havoc now that there was nobody to tame <g class=\"gr_ gr_592 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling multiReplace\" id=\"592\" data-gr-id=\"592\">it\u2019s</g> tantalizing power.</p><p>\u00a0 She was broken from her trance when the gem suddenly began to burn hotter than ever before, almost causing her to drop the damned thing when she heard the familiar thunder of an opening portal, feeling his presence take control of the very Earth she stood on. She turned her head to peer over her shoulder, watching Thanos step from his portal, flashing her the emerald Time Stone that gleamed on his gauntlet. She flashed him the Mind Stone in response, earning her a grin from his scarred face, claw marks grazing down his cheeks in daunting memories. But it had all been worth it when he approached (Y/N), her knee beginning to bend in his presence, but he held her chin instead, making her look his dead in the eye.</p><p>\u00a0 \u201cYou must not bow, my child, for you have done the Universe an exceptional service today that will span for many long generations,\u201d Thanos announced to her proudly. \u201cYou will forever be remembered for your bravery, for you are the only one of my loyal servants to have not failed me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI would never, Father,\u201d (Y/N) responded submissively, but held her head up high to Thanos, like a soldier receiving\u00a0the most morbid Medal of Honor to have ever been given. Absolute mutiny.</p><p>\u00a0 Everyone was forced to watch from the outskirts of (Y/N)\u2019s shield that surrounded herself and Thanos as she handed him the stone. Nothing could stop the disgusted grimace that bubbled up from deep inside Steve\u2019s core when the name\u00a0\u201cFather\u201d spilled from (Y/N)\u2019s lips. It was so casual, he almost believed her. But it wasn\u2019t her. That thing just looked like her. But it didn\u2019t make what he was forced to watch any easier to digest. He wasn\u2019t sure if he would ever be able to truly swallow it down. Not that he had the time to do so anyway.</p><p>\u00a0 Thanos grasped the Mind Stone from (Y/N)\u2019s fingertips, slamming the crystal into his gauntlet to complete his collection, the electrifying jolts of magic racing through his veins in vibrant colors. (Y/N) could feel the power surge through her own veins as she felt his hand rest on her shoulder. She breathed it in like oxygen. It was better than oxygen. Intoxicating.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 But the connection was sliced off by the blade of an ax that buried itself into Thanos\u2019s wide chest, purple blood spurting from the gaping wound as the forcefield that surrounded them dissipated into thin air. Thor landed next to (Y/N), preparing for a fight, but Thanos waved her off. She stood to his side as a sentry, a neutral expression painted on her face as Thor grabbed the back of Thanos\u2019s head and the hilt of his ax, burying it deeper into Thanos\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u00a0 \u201cI told you, you\u2019d die for that,\u201d Thor avowed, vengeance set in his immovable expression. He had made good on his threat, watching as his brother\u2019s murderer roared in pain, lolling his head to the side when Thor ceased the ax. Thanos began mumbling something, his words disjointed by his dying breaths\u2026or so Thor believed. But (Y/N) knew better. He wouldn\u2019t have waved her off if the bastard didn\u2019t have a plan.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou\u2026you should have gone for the head,\u201d Thanos growled as he shoved Thor away from him, ripping the ax from his body as he snatched (Y/N) roughly by the shoulder, absorbing her powers into his gauntlet as his Power Stone completed. And with a final haunting grin towards his audience, he snapped his fingers and the Sun had finally seemed to have had enough as the world went blind, only Thor\u2019s lasting howl echoing in the back of everyone\u2019s minds.</p><p>\u00a0 When the world returned to Steve\u2019s vision, all he saw was (Y/N) as her body hit the ground. He wasn\u2019t fast enough to catch her, but he lunged to reach her, trying to find a pulse that wasn\u2019t there. He gently brushed the flyaways from her face, tracing her bruised and scarred cheeks that were devoid of any color. He tucked her into his chest, rocking slowly back and forth on the forest floor in disbelief, not wanting to accept what had just happened. Who he was holding.</p><p>\u00a0 This wasn\u2019t how it was supposed to be. This wasn\u2019t right. They should have been home by then, embracing each other in bed after a sound night of sleep. He was supposed to be looking into her eyes, getting lost in the plans of their future together. The endless possibilities they were supposed to share.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 But reality was cruel. No, he wouldn\u2019t accept it. His mind reeled back to the events of the last few days, but nothing made sense. Nothing mattered anymore. Everything felt meaningless as he pulled her closer to his chest, burying his face in her hair.</p><p>\u00a0 All he could do was choke out strangled\u00a0\u2018I love you\u2019s into the deafening silence. He had no prayers left. She had been his last, and only one.</p><p>\u00a0 Thor stared in shock at Steve and (Y/N), watching the life leave Steve just as it had (Y/N). His teammates, friends, family, people he thought he would spend the rest of his life with. He understood the abhorrent depths of what Steve was feeling, distinguishing the dull pain that shrouded his friend\u2019s eyes as it had his own when he laid over Loki\u2019s body. And everything came full circle as his eyes met the smoking gauntlet on Thanos\u2019s hand, the entire thing melted and charred in black ash, a foretelling of the next disturbing minutes to come.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d Thor shouted at him in desperation.\u00a0\u201cWhat did you do?!\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 But all Thanos did was backhand Thor across the plane, striding over to where (Y/N) lay in Steve\u2019s arms, determined to retrieve his perfect weapon. Steve fought Thanos, fought him harder than he\u2019d ever fought for anything, standing over (Y/N) as Thanos bore his full weight on the grieving Super Soldier. Steve gritted his teeth, his arms giving way to the massive Mad Titan that threatened to crush him and take all that he had left of her. He couldn\u2019t understand it. But she was really gone now. She was really\u2026</p><p>\u00a0 Thanos swatted Steve aside, finally reaching (Y/N)\u2019s body that he carefully caressed in his arms, giving one last prideful look towards Thor before he stepped back into his portal, disappearing from the horrors that he cast upon the Universe.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 Steve awoke a moment after Thanos left, scrambling to his feet as he called (Y/N)\u2019s name. With a heavy heart, Bucky held his friend, trying to calm him down, but Steve pushed Bucky off of him. Limping towards Thor, he repeated hollowly,\u00a0\u201cwhere is he? Where did he take her? Thor, where\u2019d he go?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 Thor had no response for him. He wished that he had any words, anything at all to console Steve, but he didn\u2019t. He had nothing. Everything he had worked <g class=\"gr_ gr_617 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"617\" data-gr-id=\"617\">for</g> to get the ax. Nedavelir. Taking on the force of a fucking star. None of it made a difference. And just like Steve, Thor felt that everything was meaningless. Half his people were slaughtered, now with Heimdall, Loki, and (Y/N). What more could Thanos take from him? The Mad Titan had ruined him.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSteve?\u201d Bucky called out, finally getting Steve\u2019s attention just as his body crashed into a flurry of gray ash. Steve stumbled towards his best friend, but again, he was too late. He knelt down beside the ash, placing a trembling hand onto the ground where Bucky had just been, but\u2026the numbness suddenly returned. It was so striking that Steve\u2019s knees finally gave out beneath him as he stared from Thor to the ground. There was an emptiness in them. Like looking at a corpse.</p><p>\u00a0 He heard light footsteps race behind him, registering them as Natasha\u2019s before she placed her hand on his shoulder, her other hand pressed to her stomach, her mouth agape as she caught sight of Vision\u2019s dead body. But Steve could barely feel her attempt at comfort. He could only stare at where Bucky had been.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhat is this? What the hell is happening?\u201d Rhodey tried to ask Thor, but Thor was just as speechless as Natasha, Bruce, and Rocket, not one being able to rationalize what Thanos had just done.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOh, God,\u201d was Steve\u2019s only response, a shard of ice buried in his heart.</p><hr><p><b>D I S T A N T \u00a0- \u00a0P L A N E T</b></p><p><b>\u00a0</b> She awoke to the soft sunlight of dawn, the moment just as the Sun broke the boundaries of the horizon to begin a new day.</p><p>\u00a0 But what was the point anymore? What is a new day when half the Universe had just been slaughtered? She felt like she was frozen, like time couldn\u2019t go on until everything returned to the way it was just after the Avengers saved New York. After possibilities arose, and the word\u00a0\u201cheroes\u201d actually had a meaning to her. When anything had a\u00a0meaning to her.</p><p>\u00a0 All she could remember was a flash of Steve dissolving in the shadows of the jungle, the blinding gold of the Mind Stone, and Vision\u2019s hollow eye sockets.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 She didn\u2019t want to open her eyes. She didn\u2019t want to wake to a world where Steve could possibly be gone. Where her family was dead\u2026again. In a Universe where she was responsible for severing the lifelines of half the people in it. She couldn\u2019t decide if it would be better or worse to know who had survived and who had\u2026But the voice that she dreaded cut through her core like steel grating iron.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSo, she finally wakes,\u201d Thanos proclaimed into the sunrise, basking in its welcoming glow that brought promises of a bright future for the Universe he had just rescued. His destiny had been met. But, there was still one loose end he had to tie up before everything was settled. Without looking behind him, he felt (Y/N) stand from her cot, striding calmly to the front of their wooden shack on the edge of a viridescent landscape that sprawled over miles and miles of luscious hills that sprouted millions of trees. She heard the wild call of a lonesome bird, its one-note song solidifying something heavy in her chest. Stars hung faintly in the dawning sky beside a low hovering moon, it\u2019s surface so close, (Y/N) felt like if she strained enough on her toes, she could poke one of its craters, hopefully, fall inside one and never come out again.</p><p>\u00a0 Wherever this serene place was, it was a stone-cold liar. A deceiving land that attempted to replace beauty with the agony that Thanos had caused that would ripple across generations like a hurricane causing tsunamis in every surrounding country it could reach. This place disgusted (Y/N), but she couldn\u2019t turn away from the rising sun, furious at its audacity to continue to rise, and for time to continue to move forward. It was an outrage against humanity.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou did it, didn\u2019t you?\u201d (Y/N) whispered calmly, a deathly calm that didn\u2019t surprise Thanos, but still left him with a grave chill as she sat beside him.</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) already knew the answer to her question. She could feel it in her bones. But she had to hear it stated out loud to fully believe it. She had to.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhat other reason would I have to be here enjoying the sunrise?\u201d he answered, leaning back to take in the warmth as he closed his eyes, fully content in the experience he had dreamed of for decades.</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) wasn\u2019t having that.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDoes it feel as satisfying without her here?\u201d she whispered coldly, her gaze fixed on the cattails that swayed mournfully in the breeze, only their brushes across the long grasses filling the sullen silence.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou remind me of her, you know,\u201d Thanos finally said, evading her heartwrenching question to test the waters.\u00a0\u201cShe was brave like you. A fearsome fighter\u2026I may not have her with me any longer, but I do have you.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 The wrath that was seething beneath her calm exterior finally broke as she ripped a large stake of wood from the ceiling, projecting it into his bicep where it buried itself into his muscle with a sickening crunch. He just stared at it passively, withdrawing it from his flesh like a woodchip as he tossed it from hand to hand. (Y/N) still refused to look at him, but her eyes had grown much darker with a lust for blood.</p><p>\u00a0 Yet her magic was depleted. The Power Stone was destroyed. All she had left was her boiling rage and hunger for vengeance as her fingers curled into fists atop her knees.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou don\u2019t <i>have</i> me,\u201d (Y/N) sneered. \u201cI\u2019m not yours to have. The stones are gone, you rapacious sadist. You know that you can\u2019t control me otherwise\u2026so why even try?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Thanos could see through her hateful words like shattering glass, see the pain that was slowly eating her alive. He knew that she was goading him into killing her. Not able to handle the guilt of what she believed to be murder.

He would never be able to break her far enough to become his new right hand. Never.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThere was a time when I had the utmost faith in you, (Y/N),\u201d Thanos ranted as he stood above her. \u201cA time when I could see the opportunities\u00a0for us together as clear as this beautiful day rising before us. But it seems like our time together must be cut short, unfortunately. I once thought you were the only one who could carry out what needs to be done from this day forward, but it appears that another may be able to take your place.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) froze at that admission. He had more plans beyond the Snap. She felt dizzy at the thought of how stupid she had been, believing that somehow after this was all over that he would be satisfied. But a power-hungry madman like himself would never be satisfied. It was just in his nature.</p><p>\u00a0 She tried to make a move to run, but he caught her by the neck, anticipating her escape.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDespite how you\u2019ve portrayed yourself over the last few years, you always somehow return to your roots: a runaway. Hiding from your fears when they finally get the best of you. You wear a nice mask, but it runs in your blood,\u201d he growled at her as she struggled in his grasp.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 But then she saw it. A shard of amethyst light buried in the wound on his wrist. It was small, and probably not what she thought it was, but she had a shimmer of slim hope that wedged its way into her veins, forcing her fingers to reach towards the lustrous fragment that she could have sworn had winked at her.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cStill, I may come to regret this decision. You would have been my crowning jewel to a now worthy empire\u2026but I doubt it,\u201d Thanos declared as he grabbed ahold of a gleaming silver sword, aiming the blade towards her heart.\u00a0\u201cMay you go in peace, my child,\u201d he said to her just as her fingers grasped the shard of amethyst, her intentions going to a portal, willing it to appear behind her. But instead, she felt the freezing cold blade impale her gut, narrowly dodging her heart when she lurched in his grasp. Yet, the pain wasn\u2019t any less intense, digging around her insides like a living being as Thanos glared her down.</p><p>\u00a0 She glared back at him with piercing silver eyes that gave him whiplash as he struggled for understanding. He just barely glanced at the amethyst fragment she was clutching in her bloody fingers before a portal opened behind her, exactly where her mind had wielded it. She gave him one last victorious smile before she shoved herself off of his blade, the sharp edge grazing vital organs in her body before she let herself fall into the endless void, ignoring the sinking feeling that pulled her towards the desire to end it all. The only thing she could hear was the violent, bloodthirsty roars of Thanos that echoed around her, but even those faded as she fell down\u2026down\u2026down the rabbit hole. Now, all she could hear was the whistling of the wind whip past her freezing cold ears. Everything was getting colder as her breath became a struggle. But she decided to struggle.</p><p>\u00a0 Maybe there was one thing that still gave her life meaning after all.</p><p>\u00a0 Revenge.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b> \u00a0<g class=\"gr_ gr_563 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del\" id=\"563\" data-gr-id=\"563\">T O</g> \u00a0- \u00a0B E \u00a0- \u00a0C O N T I N U E D</b></p><p><b>T A G S</b>: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlSoQ-tzWXqmHBQjEOwnDYg\">@benedrylcumbersnatch</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mR0IW7pRRTlGjpaBZzLfoVw\">@daniellajocelyn</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYlu0CG6g0HV126mDX5EUAA\">@shannonr2003</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muXrTh8-Cv3mjVDxjEs3Ktg\">@ever-so-slightly-below-average</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKJ5sTXat_3jOUb9CtnlJjw\">@mysteriouslysharkbait</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mt6uzR8mKp99MC6sWbfZb_w\">@sireennotsiren</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDkKVCSpAX6qq9iDj5NKJLw\">@pluvialday</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/me4cXs-LqZjfS_X4AiYJsiQ\">@thenogravity</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjfaeGdUxkUDrEfygL1CdqQ\">@iiicurlingwavesiii</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtifdrf4Wv9zh77_HIw6Rng\">@i-only-signed-up-for-fanfiction</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUxwWE4gjyaVLsK28-QE45Q\">@introvertedsin</a></p><p>**Updates: And that\u2019s the end of Part 7, my loves! Fuck me, that was a lot. I went back and forth on whether this should be the end of the series and the reader should just die, but\u2026I enjoy the struggle too much apparently so I will return again with (possibly the final) Part 8 when the last film comes out. Thinking I\u2019ll continue after that with some fluff chapters with homely Avengers far in the future starting families and stuff, but we\u2019ll see (maybe even create an alternate ending if Marvel goes all emo on us). I hope y\u2019all have enjoyed my heartache because\u00a0if anyone knows anything about fanfiction, the pain is all a part of the process, but I really am happy with the results so far. In the meantime, I think I\u2019m gonna take a short break from Tumblr just to relax my aching brain. This doesn\u2019t mean that my blog will be dead over the next few months. If anyone has any requests, I\u2019d be so fucking honored to take them on as well as finish some of my other unfinished projects (including an overly ambitious Harry Potter Fem!Slytherin Reader series if anyone\u2019s interested). Thank you all again for the support and I\u2019ll be back as soon as I can!</p><p>**Please don\u2019t forget to follow and hit that notification button to make sure that you don\u2019t miss a damn thing if you like my shit.

Falling down her rabbit hole didn&rsquo;t lead (Y/N) to breathtaking lands of shit-talking flowers and fantastical adventures with hookah smoking caterpillars. No. Her reality was much darker. The hole that she fell through left her more dazed and confused than Alice had ever been.<br /></p><p>&nbsp; With her hair&nbsp;whipping past her face, she wished bitterly that Lewis Carroll had written her life&rsquo;s story. At least then she might be able to do some shrooms to staunch the pain and help her to forget&hellip;forget everything. She didn&rsquo;t want to remember what she had done. She just wanted to disappear.</p><hr /><p>&nbsp;<b>W A K A N D A</b></p><p><b>&nbsp; </b>Nothing could have prepared Steve for the hellish creatures that charged the open barrier. It was the bloodiest war he had ever seen, and that was saying a lot. Even with Wanda and a special appearance by Thor to aid them, the battle left them gruesomely outnumbered to the deranged beasts that continued to pour in endless droves from the extraterrestrial ships like the bursting of several angry hornet&rsquo;s nests all at once.</p><p>&nbsp; He had hardly a moment to breathe between the slaughter of one creature before another one, or two, or five were on top of him again, wicked teeth and jagged claws slashing at every inch of skin they could gouge. He couldn&rsquo;t help the guttural fear that grasped him as he stared down the gullet of the beast that struck him to the ground, drips of blood and slobber spilled over him as the darkness became overpowering despite the blinding daylight that sweltered the battlefield in sickening heat.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; But before the beast could rip his head off, he felt the relief of its weight lifted from his ragged body, managing to lift his head enough to see Bucky wrestle the thing to the ground with the final stab of his oversized hunting knife as T&rsquo;Challa distracted the other two, slashing furiously with his own vibranium&nbsp;claws. Bucky extended Steve his hand, patting his friend heavily on the back.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Never thought I&rsquo;d wish for the forties again,&ldquo; Bucky sighed as he retrieved his fallen gun, taking a moment to not pass out. He also never thought until that moment that he would ever have to wonder what his own personal hell would look like&hellip;but this wretched place was giving Hydra a run for its blood money.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Never thought I&rsquo;d be grateful for you saving my ass again,&rdquo; Steve responded breathlessly, punching Bucky in the shoulder who smiled back at him.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Comes with the job, pal,&rdquo; Bucky winked before charging back into the thick of the battle. Steve watched him go until he felt a presence&nbsp;behind him, where he backflipped over the beast that tried to tackle him, but Steve was quicker. He tried not to think of the sticky blood that drowned his boots as he stepped from the creature&rsquo;s skull to continue his fight.</p><p>&nbsp; The Sun was a curse on the land, seeming to burn with a vendetta against the treachery that it was forced to witness over it&rsquo;s ancient, green Earth. It was an absolute mutiny. Despite the legendary beauty Wakanda had once held, it was now torn by the foulest of smells and the rotten spoils of war.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; But there was a sudden shift. A breeze blew past Steve, sending familiar chills down his spine as he turned towards the direction of the refreshing, northern wind. He wanted to believe it was her, that she had come back, but he would not give in to his foolish hopes. He needed to know for sure. He needed to see&hellip;</p><p>&nbsp; The battlefield parted around a thundercloud portal, shadows twisting sinisterly from beneath the smoke that rose and fell with a malevolent life of its own as blue lightning flashed within its depths. But he was transfixed on the dark figure that stepped from the portal, her ethereal beauty and undeniable power knocking the last remnants of breath he had been holding from his gasping lungs. It was like he always teased her: <i>how can someone be so damn addicting?</i></p><p><i>&nbsp; </i>She always had a snarky comment to follow his question, of course. And that was one of the millions of reasons why he loved her, and why his feet naturally gravitated towards her after his initial state of shock, desperate to hold her in his arms again. Wanting to apologize for ever letting her slip out of his hands, to begin with, and to promise that it would never happen again.</p><p>&nbsp; He was so spellbound by her presence that he hadn&rsquo;t bothered to notice the feral beast that launched itself towards him, fangs bared to sink into his neck. But by the time he caught sight of the creature from his periphery, it was already too late. Throwing up his arms to protect himself, he waited for the fatal slash of claws that never came. Peering over his defenses, he saw the beast writhing on the ground with a silver ice katana buried deep into its own neck.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; His head whipped back towards (Y/N), her eyes consumed by a haunting sapphire&nbsp;light that flickered out as soon as she saw him. She narrowed her eyes at him a moment, then allowed a huge smile to brighten her features that glowed in the now tolerable sunlight. They both crossed the field to each other, (Y/N) not even looking at the beasts before they burst into amethyst flames.</p><p>&nbsp; And Steve couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder: <i>How had she gotten so much more powerful in so little time? </i>But as soon as she jumped into his arms, all worries melted from his mind, dissolving into the overwhelming feeling of relief. He squeezed her tight, whispering&nbsp;&lsquo;I love you&rsquo; into the crook of her neck as he kissed the top of her head, noticing the strands of white that decorated her {your color} hair, but forgot as soon as she pulled away, revealing the face that he had missed more than anything he&rsquo;d ever missed in his life. Overcome by her presence, he tried to lean in for a kiss, but her face dropped as she threw her hand over his lips. His brows furrowed as she giggled playfully.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Look, you can kiss me until I&rsquo;m blue in the face once this is all over, Captain,&rdquo; she purred, pursing her lips seductively as she leaned closer to him.&nbsp;&ldquo;But first, I need to know where Vision is.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; Steve pulled her hand into his own as he laughed at his own distraction.&nbsp;&ldquo;And finally we&rsquo;ve reached the day where&nbsp;<i>you&rsquo;re</i> the one more focused on the mission than <i>me</i>,&rdquo; he teased her, kissing her hand that she cupped around his cheek before it fell away, her impatience getting the better of her.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Steve, there isn&rsquo;t time for this. Tell me where Vision is, now&hellip;please,&rdquo; she added politely at the end.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;yeah, of course,&rdquo; Steve nodded as he pointed towards a large, grey building that was built into the luscious cliffside. Raging waterfalls spilled from the end of the jungle like tears rushing from the crystal clear skies, a startling comparison to the massacre below its tranquility. Just as he began to speak again, they both caught sight of two figures breaking out of one of the windows where they fell into the endless sea of trees below.</p><p>&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>Guys, we got a Vision situation here</i>,&rsquo; Sam called through Steve&rsquo;s earpiece.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That was Vision. We have to get to him,&rdquo; Steve said quickly to (Y/N), tugging on her hand towards the forest, but before he could relay that news over the intercom, her other hand fell onto his own, pulling it away from his ear.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, wait!&rdquo; She exclaimed, but quickly composed herself. &ldquo;Steve, I&rsquo;ve got this one. You stay here and fight. The team needs you down here. I&rsquo;ve got Vision.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But-&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; Steve started, but (Y/N) kissed his cheek, letting her lips linger close to his ear.&nbsp;&ldquo;Stay here. I&rsquo;ve got this,&rdquo; she repeated. And, before he could argue, she was already gone, the last of her image disappearing into the shadows of the jungle.</p><p>&nbsp; Steve tried to turn away, he really did. He wanted to trust her, but there was something so&hellip;off about what had just happened. The way she wouldn&rsquo;t kiss him (it was more likely that she would&rsquo;ve jumped his bones right there on the battlefield than her not kiss him at all), the way she giggled like a schoolgirl (yeah, right), and the way she wouldn&rsquo;t let him fight with her when they had <i>just </i>reunited. Everything felt fake. Forced. It was an act.</p><p>&nbsp; There were some things that couldn&rsquo;t be faked, and one of them was love.</p><p>&nbsp;<i> That was not (Y/N),</i>&nbsp;Steve realized with a striking jolt, pivoting on his heels away from the battlefield to follow whatever was taking the form of his fiancee.</p><hr /><p>&nbsp; Branches clawed at (Y/N)&rsquo;s arms and legs, but she blew them aside with her magic, snapping entire trees in half to make way for her until she heard a struggle through the leaves. She ducked into the bushes, lithely making her way towards a clearing that opened up to a fight between Veronica (which she guessed was being controlled by Bruce) and one of Thanos&rsquo;s meathead minions, a creature that looked like an overcooked Ninja Turtle. The two threw punch after punch at each other in the pit of the waterfalls, tripping over themselves in the shallow river.</p><p>&nbsp; She watched for a moment until her Power Stone began to burn against her chest, signaling for her to keep moving as she was getting closer to her target. She grappled up the side of a small cliff to peer over a plane where Vision and another one of Thanos&rsquo;s minions were standing face-to-face just as Vision was knocked down to his knees. The black and gold cloaked minion towered over Vision with a bladed staff. (Y/N) almost stopped him, but thought better of it just as the blade sunk into Vision&rsquo;s chest with a guttural groan.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I thought you were a formidable machine,&rdquo; the minion growled, hovering Vision above the ground as his form began to flicker. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re dying like any man.&rdquo; Releasing the blade, the minion left Vision to crumble in a heap to the ground. But before he could strike again, (Y/N) sliced his head clean off. His torso fell to the side in a cloud of red dirt before a wide-eyed Vision who stared at the body, at (Y/N), then back at the body. The sorceress never even flinched.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Third time I&rsquo;ve beheaded someone in just over two days. Think there&rsquo;s a rehab for that?&rdquo; (Y/N) joked darkly as she twirled her blue-bloodied dagger, then replaced it in her holster. With a sigh, she extended her hand to Vision.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I suppose a thank you is in order, now,&rdquo; he laughed wearily as he leaned against her for support.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Better be. I don&rsquo;t save just anybody, Mr. Robot. I have priorities, dammit.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, I am certainly glad to be one of them,&rdquo; Vision responded, groaning as his wound extended and contracted with every step he took. He knew he shouldn&rsquo;t be walking, but at least he had (Y/N) to fight for him now, despite the shudder that ran through him at what he had just seen her do. But he knew her, and more importantly, he trusted her as his girlfriend&rsquo;s best friend. At least he knew that was finally safe.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; However, through his increasingly fuzzy vision, he noticed they were trekking further into the jungle, the opposite direction of where they needed to go. He cleared his throat. &ldquo;May I ask, though. Where are we walking to? I believe the main facility is back that way,&rdquo; he commented, looking over to (Y/N) who was staring straight ahead, her face no longer anything that he recognized as the sounds of Bruce&rsquo;s fight died down and the silence blanketed the heavy trees that surrounded them like prison bars.&nbsp;&ldquo;(Y/N)?&rdquo; Vision asked her again. But the chill that greeted him froze him to the core just as his stone began to sear into his skull.</p><p>&nbsp; Suddenly, (Y/N) turned on Vision, but all she could focus on was the golden Mind Stone. It beckoned to her with tantalizing whispers of desire.</p><p>&nbsp; And finally, she understood Thanos&rsquo;s claim for destiny. No, she <i>felt</i> it. The stone was rightfully hers for the taking. It always had been. Thanos had just been the one to point it out to her.</p><p>&nbsp; Her own Power Stone seemed to call out to the Mind Stone as it burned furiously against her chest, making Vision wince in response as his eyes met with hers through the shadows of the brush.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I promise, this is nothing personal,&rdquo; (Y/N) said to him distantly as she shoved him to the ground. She encircled him, icy fingers trailing his neck as she rounded to face him, himself barely able to get to his knees.&nbsp;&ldquo;Just something Thanos wants. And what Thanos wants&hellip;&rdquo; she said, raising her hand towards the stone,&nbsp;&ldquo;I get.&rdquo; And with her final snarl, she sent a beam of purple and silver light towards Vision, extracting a roar of anguish from his lips that burst through the treetops like the blares of an alarm.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; She could see the Mind Stone beginning to shift in his forehead, her vicious magic carving it out of his own head before her very eyes. From beyond the mind control, her confused and terrified self felt something shatter deep inside of her. Something that she couldn&rsquo;t understand or begin to define. Before that moment, she always believed that she was the most broken that she could ever be. There was nothing else dark enough to phase her any longer.</p><p>&nbsp; But she was wrong. So, painfully wrong.</p><p>&nbsp; Everything was more intense in those torturous seconds. The humidity from the scornful Sun. The roaring of the waterfalls. The screams of some alien creature. The unforgiving nature of her magic that was so cold, it burned.</p><p>&nbsp; But as soon as she saw the beginnings of exposed wiring, she heard a terrified voice shriek out her name.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;(Y/N)!? What are you doing?&rdquo; Wanda cried, not able to believe the atrocity&nbsp;before her, but she snapped out of it when she saw Vision&rsquo;s face. In her haste, she shot (Y/N) with a red spell that knocked her friend into a backward roll. Landing on her feet, (Y/N) snapped her head up to Wanda who rushed to Vision&rsquo;s aid, asking if he was okay as he fell limp into her arms.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing what&rsquo;s right for the Universe. Something you&rsquo;ve never been able to do,&rdquo; (Y/N) spit at her, not even bothering to conceal herself any longer, allowing the Sapphire of her mind control infiltrate her eyes with brutal intensity. Wanda watched (Y/N) with horror, finally understanding that what was stalking her was not her friend any longer.&nbsp;&ldquo;Even when you tried, you still managed to kill eleven innocent people in a country you had no right to be in&hellip;don&rsquo;t you feel disgusted with yourself for what you did? How can you even live with yourself? Murderer,&rdquo; she dragged out the words, the emphasis like dragging a dagger across Wanda&rsquo;s heart, slowly slicing deeper and deeper each time she repeated it.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; Wanda quivered, closing her eyes to the thoughts of that obscene day that haunted her every single night. But she couldn&rsquo;t shut them out this time.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Murderer,&rdquo; (Y/N) continued to chant, crouching lower in her stance to launch herself at the witch, preparing for the kill.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t listen to her. She&rsquo;s baiting you, Wanda,&rdquo; Vision pleaded, pulling Wanda from her nightmares that (Y/N) was so clearly inducing, the red magic of the Reality Stone sparking off her own fingertips as the ice sorceress snarled at her.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;How can you trust yourself after losing control time and time again? The cycle just continues, Wanda. You use your powers, and people die. Maybe you were just born a bad omen. Born to cause death wherever you go&hellip;and to whoever you grow close to. That reminds me&hellip;how is Pietro doing these days?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; Wanda stopped crying, her trembling body going still as her eyes flickered up to (Y/N), a rage like nothing she had ever seen filling the witch&rsquo;s eyes. Laying Vision against a stone, she stood protectively in front of him, her hands spiraling offensively in front of her as she stared down the imposter. (Y/N) just laughed.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; she scoffed, throwing her hair over her shoulder.&nbsp;&ldquo;Please, Wanda. We both know that I&rsquo;m stronger than you. <i>Everyone</i> knows it. And I always have been.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But I have more to lose,&rdquo; Wanda concluded through gritted teeth as she charged (Y/N) who dodged her first beam, but got blasted into the trunk of an ancient tree that somehow held its ground on the second. Wanda tried to blast (Y/N) again, aiming for her heart to stun the sorceress, but, as predicted, (Y/N) was not only faster, but much stronger. Holding off Wanda&rsquo;s beam as she began to walk towards the witch, her hands held firmly in front of her as she placed one foot in front of the other until she was almost nose-to-nose with Wanda where she slipped out of the beam, spinning to her left to elbow Wanda in the side of her head, sending the witch sprawling into the dirt. She attempted to stand her ground again, but (Y/N) swept her legs from under her and kicked her into a boulder where she smashed her head.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; (Y/N) walked over to where she lay, toeing the witch curiously, but her body lay still, red leather jacket frosted in wicked silver ice that curled in amethyst smoke, rising like the dead from a grave. With a satisfied smirk, (Y/N) crossed the plane to reach Vision, planning to finish her mission, but a body crashed into her, throwing her to the ground as he pinned her wrists to the dirt.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; His face was still beautiful despite the blood and ash that smeared his features, dusting his beard that had grown unkept in her absence. In her head, she begged him to run away, to get as far from her as possible before she&hellip;before she did something that she would never be able to forgive herself for. Something so unthinkable&hellip;but it wasn&rsquo;t unthinkable. It was right at her fingertips that were already glowing a dangerous shade of violet, daring him to test her any further. But of course, he did. And she hated him for it.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;(Y/N)! Wake up!&rdquo; Steve ordered her, knocking the blade from her grasp before she could stab him, digging his knee into her chest.&nbsp;&ldquo;Come back to me! You know me. You love me. Don&rsquo;t leave me here, (Y/N). Please.&rdquo; She rolled on top of him for a moment, but he pinned her back down again, hooking his foot behind her knee to slam her harder into the ground. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re so much stronger than whatever&rsquo;s controlling you. You are (Y/N) (Y/L/N). And you&rsquo;re coming home with me because you are the fiercest person I&rsquo;ve ever met. You can beat this. You always have. Please! You have to wake up!&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; He begged her, kissing her forehead, her cheeks, her lips, but her eyes were distant. Blank. He didn&rsquo;t recognize them. They weren&rsquo;t hers. He shook her, the tears falling down his face onto her heaving chest, but it was hopeless. He knew what he had to do&hellip;but he could never. He would rather die than do that.</p><p>&nbsp; His eyes shot up to hers as her lips began to move, a strangled voice attempting to escape the barriers. He waited, encouraging her to speak, but her eyes narrowed just as she found her voice, eyes flashing in an eerie shade of violet.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Get off of me!&rdquo; she growled as she forced him off of her in an explosion of violet that careened him onto his back. She stood over him as she kicked him in the side like a wounded dog. Lifting her chin, she sneered at him distastefully.&nbsp;&ldquo;Weak idiot. Even when you know that she&rsquo;s gone, you still can&rsquo;t bear to kill me. Pitiful. We need strong men and women in the next life. I hope the Snap wipes you out first. Call it Darwinian justice.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; And with her final words to him, she used her magic to throw him like a bullet through the trees. Hell knew where she threw him or if he survived, but she didn&rsquo;t care. She only turned back to Vision who was being caressed by Wanda, all color drained from her face as he pleaded with her to destroy the stone, but it was too late. (Y/N) was already prowling towards them, a predator, her aura of the same eerie violet light from her eyes surrounding her figure. She exuded power in its purest form. She was Power.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; Wanda tried to stop her one last time, stronger than the last, but she was cast aside once again. It was a hard fought battle, torturous to witness, but despairing in the end. There were flashes of battles between her versus Bucky, versus T&rsquo;Challa, versus Bruce, Natasha, Rhodey, Sam&hellip;they all attempted to match her, but she was an avalanche rushing down a mountain. A winter storm against a ship in the middle of a raging sea. They came at her one at a time, but even if they worked together, it was hopeless. Maybe this was her destiny. Maybe Strange was wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; No, he was wrong. She wasn&rsquo;t the hero in this story. She was never meant to be.</p><p>&nbsp; Grasping Vision with her magic, she ripped the last of the Mind Stone from his head with her bare hands, wires wrenched from their sockets with dying sparks as she dropped his gray, lifeless body to the ground like he was nothing. Not even a person. Just a means to Thanos&rsquo;s end.</p><p>&nbsp; Inside, (Y/N) couldn&rsquo;t stop replaying the image of his pleading eyes that dulled and rolled into the back of his head the moment she tore the stone from his skull, the way his last breath sounded as it escaped his lips, undoubtedly the most horrifying sound she had ever heard. She was a murderer. There was no mistaking it. She had just killed someone, someone she cared about, with her own bare hands. It was something she had never done before. It was&hellip;it was&hellip;</p><p>&nbsp; Beautiful. The Mind Stone glowed in a scintillating golden light brighter than the striking Sun, it&rsquo;s intensity an honor to behold. She couldn&rsquo;t believe that she was actually holding it. No dreams could compare. The key to Thanos&rsquo;s approval, the key to the balance of the Universe. She studied the gem carefully as it floated across her fingertips, noticing the tiny flecks of orange and red that twisted menacingly inside the crystal, knowing that the power was desperately searching for a release, ready to wreak havoc now that there was nobody to tame it&rsquo;s tantalizing power.</p><p>&nbsp; She was broken from her trance when the gem suddenly began to burn hotter than ever before, almost causing her to drop the damned thing when she heard the familiar thunder of an opening portal, feeling his presence take control of the very Earth she stood on. She turned her head to peer over her shoulder, watching Thanos step from his portal, flashing her the emerald Time Stone that gleamed on his gauntlet. She flashed him the Mind Stone in response, earning her a grin from his scarred face, claw marks grazing down his cheeks in daunting memories. But it had all been worth it when he approached (Y/N), her knee beginning to bend in his presence, but he held her chin instead, making her look his dead in the eye.</p><p>&nbsp; &ldquo;You must not bow, my child, for you have done the Universe an exceptional service today that will span for many long generations,&rdquo; Thanos announced to her proudly. &ldquo;You will forever be remembered for your bravery, for you are the only one of my loyal servants to have not failed me.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I would never, Father,&rdquo; (Y/N) responded submissively, but held her head up high to Thanos, like a soldier receiving&nbsp;the most morbid Medal of Honor to have ever been given. Absolute mutiny.</p><p>&nbsp; Everyone was forced to watch from the outskirts of (Y/N)&rsquo;s shield that surrounded herself and Thanos as she handed him the stone. Nothing could stop the disgusted grimace that bubbled up from deep inside Steve&rsquo;s core when the name&nbsp;&ldquo;Father&rdquo; spilled from (Y/N)&rsquo;s lips. It was so casual, he almost believed her. But it wasn&rsquo;t her. That thing just looked like her. But it didn&rsquo;t make what he was forced to watch any easier to digest. He wasn&rsquo;t sure if he would ever be able to truly swallow it down. Not that he had the time to do so anyway.</p><p>&nbsp; Thanos grasped the Mind Stone from (Y/N)&rsquo;s fingertips, slamming the crystal into his gauntlet to complete his collection, the electrifying jolts of magic racing through his veins in vibrant colors. (Y/N) could feel the power surge through her own veins as she felt his hand rest on her shoulder. She breathed it in like oxygen. It was better than oxygen. Intoxicating.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; But the connection was sliced off by the blade of an ax that buried itself into Thanos&rsquo;s wide chest, purple blood spurting from the gaping wound as the forcefield that surrounded them dissipated into thin air. Thor landed next to (Y/N), preparing for a fight, but Thanos waved her off. She stood to his side as a sentry, a neutral expression painted on her face as Thor grabbed the back of Thanos&rsquo;s head and the hilt of his ax, burying it deeper into Thanos&rsquo;s chest.</p><p>&nbsp; &ldquo;I told you, you&rsquo;d die for that,&rdquo; Thor avowed, vengeance set in his immovable expression. He had made good on his threat, watching as his brother&rsquo;s murderer roared in pain, lolling his head to the side when Thor ceased the ax. Thanos began mumbling something, his words disjointed by his dying breaths&hellip;or so Thor believed. But (Y/N) knew better. He wouldn&rsquo;t have waved her off if the bastard didn&rsquo;t have a plan.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You&hellip;you should have gone for the head,&rdquo; Thanos growled as he shoved Thor away from him, ripping the ax from his body as he snatched (Y/N) roughly by the shoulder, absorbing her powers into his gauntlet as his Power Stone completed. And with a final haunting grin towards his audience, he snapped his fingers and the Sun had finally seemed to have had enough as the world went blind, only Thor&rsquo;s lasting howl echoing in the back of everyone&rsquo;s minds.</p><p>&nbsp; When the world returned to Steve&rsquo;s vision, all he saw was (Y/N) as her body hit the ground. He wasn&rsquo;t fast enough to catch her, but he lunged to reach her, trying to find a pulse that wasn&rsquo;t there. He gently brushed the flyaways from her face, tracing her bruised and scarred cheeks that were devoid of any color. He tucked her into his chest, rocking slowly back and forth on the forest floor in disbelief, not wanting to accept what had just happened. Who he was holding.</p><p>&nbsp; This wasn&rsquo;t how it was supposed to be. This wasn&rsquo;t right. They should have been home by then, embracing each other in bed after a sound night of sleep. He was supposed to be looking into her eyes, getting lost in the plans of their future together. The endless possibilities they were supposed to share.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; But reality was cruel. No, he wouldn&rsquo;t accept it. His mind reeled back to the events of the last few days, but nothing made sense. Nothing mattered anymore. Everything felt meaningless as he pulled her closer to his chest, burying his face in her hair.</p><p>&nbsp; All he could do was choke out strangled&nbsp;&lsquo;I love you&rsquo;s into the deafening silence. He had no prayers left. She had been his last, and only one.</p><p>&nbsp; Thor stared in shock at Steve and (Y/N), watching the life leave Steve just as it had (Y/N). His teammates, friends, family, people he thought he would spend the rest of his life with. He understood the abhorrent depths of what Steve was feeling, distinguishing the dull pain that shrouded his friend&rsquo;s eyes as it had his own when he laid over Loki&rsquo;s body. And everything came full circle as his eyes met the smoking gauntlet on Thanos&rsquo;s hand, the entire thing melted and charred in black ash, a foretelling of the next disturbing minutes to come.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo; Thor shouted at him in desperation.&nbsp;&ldquo;What did you do?!&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; But all Thanos did was backhand Thor across the plane, striding over to where (Y/N) lay in Steve&rsquo;s arms, determined to retrieve his perfect weapon. Steve fought Thanos, fought him harder than he&rsquo;d ever fought for anything, standing over (Y/N) as Thanos bore his full weight on the grieving Super Soldier. Steve gritted his teeth, his arms giving way to the massive Mad Titan that threatened to crush him and take all that he had left of her. He couldn&rsquo;t understand it. But she was really gone now. She was really&hellip;</p><p>&nbsp; Thanos swatted Steve aside, finally reaching (Y/N)&rsquo;s body that he carefully caressed in his arms, giving one last prideful look towards Thor before he stepped back into his portal, disappearing from the horrors that he cast upon the Universe.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; Steve awoke a moment after Thanos left, scrambling to his feet as he called (Y/N)&rsquo;s name. With a heavy heart, Bucky held his friend, trying to calm him down, but Steve pushed Bucky off of him. Limping towards Thor, he repeated hollowly,&nbsp;&ldquo;where is he? Where did he take her? Thor, where&rsquo;d he go?&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; Thor had no response for him. He wished that he had any words, anything at all to console Steve, but he didn&rsquo;t. He had nothing. Everything he had worked for to get the ax. Nedavelir. Taking on the force of a fucking star. None of it made a difference. And just like Steve, Thor felt that everything was meaningless. Half his people were slaughtered, now with Heimdall, Loki, and (Y/N). What more could Thanos take from him? The Mad Titan had ruined him.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Steve?&rdquo; Bucky called out, finally getting Steve&rsquo;s attention just as his body crashed into a flurry of gray ash. Steve stumbled towards his best friend, but again, he was too late. He knelt down beside the ash, placing a trembling hand onto the ground where Bucky had just been, but&hellip;the numbness suddenly returned. It was so striking that Steve&rsquo;s knees finally gave out beneath him as he stared from Thor to the ground. There was an emptiness in them. Like looking at a corpse.</p><p>&nbsp; He heard light footsteps race behind him, registering them as Natasha&rsquo;s before she placed her hand on his shoulder, her other hand pressed to her stomach, her mouth agape as she caught sight of Vision&rsquo;s dead body. But Steve could barely feel her attempt at comfort. He could only stare at where Bucky had been.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What is this? What the hell is happening?&rdquo; Rhodey tried to ask Thor, but Thor was just as speechless as Natasha, Bruce, and Rocket, not one being able to rationalize what Thanos had just done.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, God,&rdquo; was Steve&rsquo;s only response, a shard of ice buried in his heart.</p><hr /><p><b>D I S T A N T &nbsp;- &nbsp;P L A N E T</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b> She awoke to the soft sunlight of dawn, the moment just as the Sun broke the boundaries of the horizon to begin a new day.</p><p>&nbsp; But what was the point anymore? What is a new day when half the Universe had just been slaughtered? She felt like she was frozen, like time couldn&rsquo;t go on until everything returned to the way it was just after the Avengers saved New York. After possibilities arose, and the word&nbsp;&ldquo;heroes&rdquo; actually had a meaning to her. When anything had a&nbsp;meaning to her.</p><p>&nbsp; All she could remember was a flash of Steve dissolving in the shadows of the jungle, the blinding gold of the Mind Stone, and Vision&rsquo;s hollow eye sockets.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t want to open her eyes. She didn&rsquo;t want to wake to a world where Steve could possibly be gone. Where her family was dead&hellip;again. In a Universe where she was responsible for severing the lifelines of half the people in it. She couldn&rsquo;t decide if it would be better or worse to know who had survived and who had&hellip;But the voice that she dreaded cut through her core like steel grating iron.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So, she finally wakes,&rdquo; Thanos proclaimed into the sunrise, basking in its welcoming glow that brought promises of a bright future for the Universe he had just rescued. His destiny had been met. But, there was still one loose end he had to tie up before everything was settled. Without looking behind him, he felt (Y/N) stand from her cot, striding calmly to the front of their wooden shack on the edge of a viridescent landscape that sprawled over miles and miles of luscious hills that sprouted millions of trees. She heard the wild call of a lonesome bird, its one-note song solidifying something heavy in her chest. Stars hung faintly in the dawning sky beside a low hovering moon, it&rsquo;s surface so close, (Y/N) felt like if she strained enough on her toes, she could poke one of its craters, hopefully, fall inside one and never come out again.</p><p>&nbsp; Wherever this serene place was, it was a stone-cold liar. A deceiving land that attempted to replace beauty with the agony that Thanos had caused that would ripple across generations like a hurricane causing tsunamis in every surrounding country it could reach. This place disgusted (Y/N), but she couldn&rsquo;t turn away from the rising sun, furious at its audacity to continue to rise, and for time to continue to move forward. It was an outrage against humanity.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You did it, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; (Y/N) whispered calmly, a deathly calm that didn&rsquo;t surprise Thanos, but still left him with a grave chill as she sat beside him.</p><p>&nbsp; (Y/N) already knew the answer to her question. She could feel it in her bones. But she had to hear it stated out loud to fully believe it. She had to.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What other reason would I have to be here enjoying the sunrise?&rdquo; he answered, leaning back to take in the warmth as he closed his eyes, fully content in the experience he had dreamed of for decades.</p><p>&nbsp; (Y/N) wasn&rsquo;t having that.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Does it feel as satisfying without her here?&rdquo; she whispered coldly, her gaze fixed on the cattails that swayed mournfully in the breeze, only their brushes across the long grasses filling the sullen silence.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You remind me of her, you know,&rdquo; Thanos finally said, evading her heartwrenching question to test the waters.&nbsp;&ldquo;She was brave like you. A fearsome fighter&hellip;I may not have her with me any longer, but I do have you.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; The wrath that was seething beneath her calm exterior finally broke as she ripped a large stake of wood from the ceiling, projecting it into his bicep where it buried itself into his muscle with a sickening crunch. He just stared at it passively, withdrawing it from his flesh like a woodchip as he tossed it from hand to hand. (Y/N) still refused to look at him, but her eyes had grown much darker with a lust for blood.</p><p>&nbsp; Yet her magic was depleted. The Power Stone was destroyed. All she had left was her boiling rage and hunger for vengeance as her fingers curled into fists atop her knees.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t <i>have</i> me,&rdquo; (Y/N) sneered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not yours to have. The stones are gone, you rapacious sadist. You know that you can&rsquo;t control me otherwise&hellip;so why even try?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; Thanos could see through her hateful words like shattering glass, see the pain that was slowly eating her alive. He knew that she was goading him into killing her. Not able to handle the guilt of what she believed to be murder. And her wish, she would finally receive because she was right. He would never be able to break her far enough to become his new right hand. Never.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;There was a time when I had the utmost faith in you, (Y/N),&rdquo; Thanos ranted as he stood above her. &ldquo;A time when I could see the opportunities&nbsp;for us together as clear as this beautiful day rising before us. But it seems like our time together must be cut short, unfortunately. I once thought you were the only one who could carry out what needs to be done from this day forward, but it appears that another may be able to take your place.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; (Y/N) froze at that admission. He had more plans beyond the Snap. She felt dizzy at the thought of how stupid she had been, believing that somehow after this was all over that he would be satisfied. But a power-hungry madman like himself would never be satisfied. It was just in his nature.</p><p>&nbsp; She tried to make a move to run, but he caught her by the neck, anticipating her escape.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Despite how you&rsquo;ve portrayed yourself over the last few years, you always somehow return to your roots: a runaway. Hiding from your fears when they finally get the best of you. You wear a nice mask, but it runs in your blood,&rdquo; he growled at her as she struggled in his grasp.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; But then she saw it. A shard of amethyst light buried in the wound on his wrist. It was small, and probably not what she thought it was, but she had a shimmer of slim hope that wedged its way into her veins, forcing her fingers to reach towards the lustrous fragment that she could have sworn had winked at her.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Still, I may come to regret this decision. You would have been my crowning jewel to a now worthy empire&hellip;but I doubt it,&rdquo; Thanos declared as he grabbed ahold of a gleaming silver sword, aiming the blade towards her heart.&nbsp;&ldquo;May you go in peace, my child,&rdquo; he said to her just as her fingers grasped the shard of amethyst, her intentions going to a portal, willing it to appear behind her. But instead, she felt the freezing cold blade impale her gut, narrowly dodging her heart when she lurched in his grasp. Yet, the pain wasn&rsquo;t any less intense, digging around her insides like a living being as Thanos glared her down.</p><p>&nbsp; She glared back at him with piercing silver eyes that gave him whiplash as he struggled for understanding. He just barely glanced at the amethyst fragment she was clutching in her bloody fingers before a portal opened behind her, exactly where her mind had wielded it. She gave him one last victorious smile before she shoved herself off of his blade, the sharp edge grazing vital organs in her body before she let herself fall into the endless void, ignoring the sinking feeling that pulled her towards the desire to end it all. The only thing she could hear was the violent, bloodthirsty roars of Thanos that echoed around her, but even those faded as she fell down&hellip;down&hellip;down the rabbit hole. Now, all she could hear was the whistling of the wind whip past her freezing cold ears. Everything was getting colder as her breath became a struggle. But she decided to struggle.</p><p>&nbsp; Maybe there was one thing that still gave her life meaning after all.</p><p>&nbsp; Revenge.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b> &nbsp;T O &nbsp;- &nbsp;B E &nbsp;- &nbsp;C O N T I N U E D</b></p><p><b>T A G S</b>: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlSoQ-tzWXqmHBQjEOwnDYg\">@benedrylcumbersnatch</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mR0IW7pRRTlGjpaBZzLfoVw\">@daniellajocelyn</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYlu0CG6g0HV126mDX5EUAA\">@shannonr2003</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muXrTh8-Cv3mjVDxjEs3Ktg\">@ever-so-slightly-below-average</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKJ5sTXat_3jOUb9CtnlJjw\">@mysteriouslysharkbait</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mt6uzR8mKp99MC6sWbfZb_w\">@sireennotsiren</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDkKVCSpAX6qq9iDj5NKJLw\">@pluvialday</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/me4cXs-LqZjfS_X4AiYJsiQ\">@thenogravity</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjfaeGdUxkUDrEfygL1CdqQ\">@iiicurlingwavesiii</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtifdrf4Wv9zh77_HIw6Rng\">@i-only-signed-up-for-fanfiction</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUxwWE4gjyaVLsK28-QE45Q\">@introvertedsin</a></p><p>**Updates: And that&rsquo;s the end of Part 7, my loves! Fuck me, that was a lot. I went back and forth on whether this should be the end of the series and the reader should just die, but&hellip;I enjoy the struggle too much apparently so I will return again with (possibly the final) Part 8 when the last film comes out. Thinking I&rsquo;ll continue after that with some fluff chapters with homely Avengers far in the future starting families and stuff, but we&rsquo;ll see (maybe even create an alternate ending if Marvel goes all emo on us). I hope y&rsquo;all have enjoyed my heartache because&nbsp;if anyone knows anything about fanfiction, the pain is all a part of the process, but I really am happy with the results so far. In the meantime, I think I&rsquo;m gonna take a short break from Tumblr just to relax my aching brain. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that my blog will be dead over the next few months. If anyone has any requests, I&rsquo;d be so fucking honored to take them on as well as finish some of my other unfinished projects (including an overly ambitious Harry Potter Fem!Slytherin Reader series if anyone&rsquo;s interested). Thank you all again for the support and I&rsquo;ll be back as soon as I can!</p><p>**Please don&rsquo;t forget to follow and hit that notification button to make sure that you don&rsquo;t miss a damn thing if you like my shit. Everyone knows that tagging has gone to hell, so I think I&rsquo;m gonna disband my tag list until Tumblr gets a grip (but I doubt it). Let me know if you have any questions and I hope you all have a kickass day xx</p>",
