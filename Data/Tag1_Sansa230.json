Sansa then has a moment of silence as she looks at Littlefinger with a weird look and saying, &ldquo;Even if I wanted, Arya would never let me&hellip;&rdquo;. Sansa throws the bait and Littlefinger grabs it. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Obviously, Sansa still has to learn, she still has demons. She is indeed jealous to see Arya and Brienne so close. She doesn&rsquo;t want to share her bodyguard. She&rsquo;s jealous that Bran gives the dagger to Arya and not to her. But is it really a serious crime? Arya speaks of beheading the lords, considering attacking her sister etc&hellip; Nobody is perfect. And being jealous of losing someone&rsquo;s attention is really a minor weakness considering her rough past. Especially since it does not really matter. It&rsquo;s just a feeling, not an act. These are just the anxieties of a girl who are quite alone while all she was looking for was the love and affection of the people around her.</p>",
