        "answer": "<p>When Aziraphale wanders to his small kitchen that morning there are many things he expects to see and on thing he doesn\u2019t expect at all. Of course, with his very odd luck, that one thing is what he finds waiting for him as he shuffles in in nothing more than a robe. Today was going to be a relaxing day off, that\u2019s what he\u2019d planned for.<br/>He hadn\u2019t planned for a visitor.</p><p>He certainly hadn\u2019t planned for the visitor to be Crowley. <br/></p><p>The demon, to his credit, looks somewhat apologetic as Aziraphale stares in mute shock at him. \u201cHello, angel,\u201d he greets, something in his tone telling Zira that this is more than one of the demon\u2019s usual drop ins. There\u2019s meaning to this, and he\u2019s left hoping it\u2019s something good. He could do with something good, these days.<br/>\u201cSorry to drop in like this. I hadn\u2019t planned to, it\u2019s just- well- it\u2019s silly is what it is.\u201d Crowley turns his face away and Aziraphale is very suddenly struck with the realization that Crowley looks distinctly thinner than he usually does. <br/>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d <br/></p><p>For all his claims of not being Crowley\u2019s friend over the years, he knows all too well how untrue it is. If anything he\u2019s Crowley\u2019s best friend, and Crowley is his. <br/>If anything, really, he loves the demon but he won\u2019t ever admit that. Ever.</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>\u201cNo, angel, I don\u2019t believe I really am. Right now, at least. I made cocoa. Or tried to. I\u2019m still not as good as you are at making it.\u201d Crowley offers a mug that Zira is happy to accept, taking a few testing sips and very nearly groaning at the flavor that graces his lips.<br/>\u201cPerfect,\u201d he mumbles into his mug, trying very hard not to blush at the fond look Crowley gives him. <br/>\u201cGlad you think so.\u201d Crowley hums, leaning back on the counter with a mug of his own cocoa in hand. <br/></p><p>There\u2019s a silence, and at first Zira dreads over having to be the one to break it. Then, Crowley speaks. \u201cI\u2019d like to stay here with you, for a while. If I could.\u201d He doesn\u2019t explain why, what\u2019s happened, anything, but then again he never really has gone into detail when he\u2019s in need. He\u2019s embarrassed about it, Zira thinks.<br/>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to stay, dear. I\u2019ve got a spare room and everything.\u201d Zira makes sure he sounds happy to have Crowley staying (not that he isn\u2019t, he just has to make it pronounced so the demon will hear it and believe it), smiling as widely as he can without it looking forced. Crowley returns the smile with his own little gentle smile, and while his eyes remain hidden behind his glasses Zira knows they\u2019re glowing.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Aziraphale.\u201d As always, it\u2019s odd to hear the name roll off the demon\u2019s tongue. Roll it does, though, and Aziraphale decides he\u2019d quite like to hear it more often. He\u2019d never want Crowley to stop saying angel, though. He\u2019s grown quite attached to the endearment over the years.<br/>\u201cAnything for you, dearest.\u201d Zira says it all too sincerely and suddenly Crowley looks almost distraught before his face melts into something more relaxed once more.</p><p>\u201cAngel?\u201d <br/>\u201cYes, dear?\u201d<br/>\u201cMay I do something a bit bold?\u201d<br/>\u201cAlways, Crowley.\u201d <br/></p><p>Aziraphale has an idea of what\u2019s coming as Crowley sets aside his cocoa and his glasses, as the demon takes a hesitant step into the angel\u2019s space. Aziraphale sets his own mug down in response, nodding encouragingly when he catches Crowley\u2019s hands nervously twitching at his sides.</p><p>Crowley finally reaches out to take Aziraphale\u2019s face in his hands, looking as though he has just gotten his hands on something extremely precious. Then, in a moment that seems to last hours, he leans in and presses his lips to Zira\u2019s. It is not a harsh kiss, it is not wanting or lusty or desperate. It\u2019s gentle and loving, everything he had heard demon\u2019s were incapable of.</p><p>It is not Crowley asking for something more, this isn\u2019t a door opening to a day spent copulating like wild animals.<br/>This is Crowley\u2019s confession, his love stated in one gesture because he has never been good with words.
