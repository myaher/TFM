        "answer": "<p>At the start of the season, she\u2019s going to be depicted as more empowered and self-assured than ever before. We are going to see her manage Winterfell and to a certain the North in preparation for the war of the dawn. She will stand for Northern Independence, continue to make the important executive decisions that will benefit her people, won\u2019t stand down against anything that threatens her home or her family, and she will be the one to hold the remaining of her people together as the fighting goes on. After the battle at Wintefell is over, her story will shift into a more personal conflict, will which will come in the form of Cersei Lannister. I think that\u2019s the case because Cersei is the villain most intricately linked with Sansa that is alive. She served as Sansa\u2019s foil, she has been the cause of a lot of the suffering that Sansa went through, plays an important part in the way Sansa changed as a person, and most importantly, they have a very personal relationship. Sansa will serve as the younger more beautiful queen that will take Cersei down. The manner in which they bring these two characters is still uncertain (but most likely be through the kidnapping plot) but it will end with Sansa overcoming her personal antagonist. The end of the season will have Sansa contributing to re-establishing the order to the North or/and Westoros. Her competence in manners of politics and management will be once again highlighted, and the season will end with her in an important position of power, regardless of what that position will be.\u00a0</p>",

I hope there is a scene where they sort of discuss their own trauma and come to respect each other as individuals like Sansa and Jon did in season 6. I really hope Sansa makes some type of Stark clothes for Arya too and Sansa learns that Arya killed Trant. I just really hate the idea that Arya will become her hand or queensguard because it puts Arya under her thumb",

Though as someone who loves to slap that block button, I must say that I have not had to do it with most Sansa stans because, as a group, they\u2019re really nice. Now that I\u2019m done being flattered though I\u2019ll move on to the actual content of what you said.</p><p>There are so many awesome Stark sister moments I hope we get in the next season, and the ones you just said would be fan-freaking-tastic. The image of the two of them talking about Arya killing one of Sansa\u2019s most vicious abusers while Sansa sews Arya some new Stark Original Pieces just made me tear up a little. Another one I\u2019m personally hoping for is something with Sansa sewing up an injured Arya\u2019s wounds or the two of them and Bran just sitting in the godswood talking after the battle is done. Stark sister closeness is what I derive my entire being from. </p><p>Now, I totally get why you don\u2019t like theories that make Arya Sansa\u2019s Hand or her Queensguard. The two of them did have a rocky relationship when they were kids, so I can see why fans often get pretty defensive when Sansa is put over Arya in certain theories or vice versa. However, while I\u2019m not sure what exactly I think Arya\u2019s fate will be (her own keep? Essos? Lady of Storm\u2019s End?) there are a few reasons why I get less defensive of theories that make Arya \u201csubservient\u201d to Sansa by making her Sansa\u2019s Hand or Queensguard then theories like \u201cArya is really Jaqen H\u2019ghar!\u201d or \u201cArya will die in the War!\u201d. I\u2019m just going to make a list of those reasons for both roles to help me keep track of my thoughts, so bear with me.</p><p><b>Arya as Queen\u2019s Hand <i>or</i> Commander of the Queensguard</b></p><ol><li><b>It makes use of Arya\u2019s skills</b>. Part of the reason its hard to theorize about Arya is because she has So Many skillsets. Her gift with languages, talent at making friends, knowledge of poisons and water dancing, and empathy for the common people would all make her a fantastic Hand, who is in charge of relations between the Queen and her people and nobles, or Queensguard, who is basically a living symbol of honor in Westeros. Many of her strengths correspond with Sansa\u2019s weaknesses, like classism or math, and they would make a pretty great ruling pair.</li><li><b>They are operating on the assumption that Sansa will be Queen.</b> I\u2019m sure there are Arya stans who think Arya will be Queen and there are plenty of general fandom members that think both of them will just end up at Winterfell. However, since these specific theories are about Arya being the Queen\u2019s Hand or in the Queensguard, they revolve around Sansa being Queen. There is actually no possible way to make Arya Sansa&rsquo;s equal in that situation. Which leads into point number 3.</li><li><b>These theories come from love for Arya</b>. If the theory is made about Sansa being queen, it&rsquo;s generally from someone who loves Sansa the most. So I just think it speaks to a genuine affection for Arya that they want her to be the second most important person in Westeros. The point of the theory isn&rsquo;t to make Arya subservient, it&rsquo;s to give her agency and power in a way that uses her skills and to keep her close to her family, who she&rsquo;s struggled to return to for basically the entire series.</li></ol><p>So, if you didnt feel like reading that whole spiel, my point is basically that, while I get why people don&rsquo;t like this theory and it&rsquo;s not something I personally believe is going to happen, I think it comes from a place of love for Arya, not a desire to make her subservient. Therefore, it&rsquo;s not something I hate so much as something I disagree with.</p><p><strike><i>Also this took me a really long time to formulate a response to, so sorry to whoever asked.</i></strike></p>",

Though as someone who loves to slap that block button, I must say that I have not had to do it with most Sansa stans because, as a group, they\u2019re really nice.

The image of the two of them talking about Arya killing one of Sansa\u2019s most vicious abusers while Sansa sews Arya some new Stark Original Pieces just made me tear up a little. Another one I\u2019m personally hoping for is something with Sansa sewing up an injured Arya\u2019s wounds or the two of them and Bran just sitting in the godswood talking after the battle is done. Stark sister closeness is what I derive my entire being from. </p><p>Now, I totally get why you don\u2019t like theories that make Arya Sansa\u2019s Hand or her Queensguard. The two of them did have a rocky relationship when they were kids, so I can see why fans often get pretty defensive when Sansa is put over Arya in certain theories or vice versa. However, while I\u2019m not sure what exactly I think Arya\u2019s fate will be (her own keep? Essos? Lady of Storm\u2019s End?) there are a few reasons why I get less defensive of theories that make Arya \u201csubservient\u201d to Sansa by making her Sansa\u2019s Hand or Queensguard then theories like \u201cArya is really Jaqen H\u2019ghar!\u201d or \u201cArya will die in the War!\u201d. I\u2019m just going to make a list of those reasons for both roles to help me keep track of my thoughts, so bear with me.</p><p><b>Arya as Queen\u2019s Hand <i>or</i> Commander of the Queensguard</b></p><ol><li><b>It makes use of Arya\u2019s skills</b>. Part of the reason its hard to theorize about Arya is because she has So Many skillsets. Her gift with languages, talent at making friends, knowledge of poisons and water dancing, and empathy for the common people would all make her a fantastic Hand, who is in charge of relations between the Queen and her people and nobles, or Queensguard, who is basically a living symbol of honor in Westeros. Many of her strengths correspond with Sansa\u2019s weaknesses, like classism or math, and they would make a pretty great ruling pair.</li><li><b>They are operating on the assumption that Sansa will be Queen.</b> I\u2019m sure there are Arya stans who think Arya will be Queen and there are plenty of general fandom members that think both of them will just end up at Winterfell. However, since these specific theories are about Arya being the Queen\u2019s Hand or in the Queensguard, they revolve around Sansa being Queen. There is actually no possible way to make Arya Sansa\u2019s equal in that situation. Which leads into point number 3.</li><li><b>These theories come from love for Arya</b>. If the theory is made about Sansa being queen, it\u2019s generally from someone who loves Sansa the most. So I just think it speaks to a genuine affection for Arya that they want her to be the second most important person in Westeros. The point of the theory isn\u2019t to make Arya subservient, it\u2019s to give her agency and power in a way that uses her skills and to keep her close to her family, who she\u2019s struggled to return to for basically the entire series.</li></ol><p>So, if you didnt feel like reading that whole spiel, my point is basically that, while I get why people don\u2019t like this theory and it\u2019s not something I personally believe is going to happen, I think it comes from a place of love for Arya, not a desire to make her subservient. Therefore, it\u2019s not something I hate so much as something I disagree with.</p><p><strike><i>Also this took me a really long time to formulate a response to, so sorry to whoever asked.</i></strike></p>",

It\u2019s just her coping mechanisms, her lack of agency, and the emotional abuse she endures that hinder her a bit.

Sansa is the girl who knew how to read better than all of her siblings. Sansa is the girl who managed to become a proper lady when she was a baby. Sansa is the girl who quickly managed to become good at multiple forms of art quickly despite being a child. Sansa is the girl who manages to adapt herself to new situations incredibly quickly. Sansa is the girl who managed to survive the King\u2019s Landing court without much of the proper political training that would have helped her there. Sansa is the girl who was told that she was a bad liar, and less than a year later, managed to easily manipulate grown men and women in a serious murder case. Sansa is the girl who never knew much about battles, yes still ended up saving the day at the battle of the bastards with the knights of the Vale. Sansa is the girl who has carefully observed many political players from the sidelines, and knew how to weed out the bad, and apply the good when she entered a position of power rather easily. Sansa learns quickly, and adapts at a even faster rate. That being said, even if Sansa is not a slow learner in the show, it\u2019s true that they\u2019ve removed a lot of moments in the books that are a testament to how smart she is and how quickly she learns. Instead, they give us plenty of scenes where she contemplates on how stupid she is, and later on how stupid she was when she was younger, and the story tries to present these statements as truths that we should just accept. As you mentioned, in the books, her lack of confidence is explicitly shown to be a result of the verbal abuse that she had to deal with for years. This lack of confidence should be not be seen as empowering because it simply isn\u2019t. Sansa has always been smart, and she has always learned quickly, and that\u2019s true in both the show and in the books.\u00a0</p>",

Therefore, she holds him accountable for his actions, isn\u2019t afraid to point out what\u2019s he\u2019s not doing correctly, while also being someone who genuinely just really enjoys being around.

Kind of Dany as a distraction- while sleeping with her on boat, he still think of sansa",
        "answer": "<p>Dear nonny,</p><p>I\u2019m quite sure, that Bran will be the most important person in the fight against the WWs. The last time they were around they were contained/defeated after some pact with the Children of the Forest, and the magic of the Old Gods of the North must be the key. Bran is the one person who was trained north of the Wall, he is the person who knows how the Children of the Forest created the WW (at least in the show). Still, that doesn\u2019t mean that the other Starks won\u2019t have anything to do. I think it will be\u00a0 joined effort and Sansa\u2019s role will be of supporting the fighters. She will organise the food, the clothes, the care for the wounded etc. Anybody who knows only a little bit about military tactics knows that the line of supply is crucial. Starving and freezing soldiers do not fight well. So I guess this will be Sansa\u2019s role. If my theory that she also has a kind of musical magic is correct, then she might also help to boost the moral of the troops, reminding them what they fight for - making music that will make them weep. I doubt this will happen in the show, they have not introduced Sansa\u2019s singing magic in the show and they won\u2019t start now. It would be quite difficult actually. As much as I like the story of Beren and Luthien, I guess it would be pretty hard to make a film of a story where one of the characters has a magical singing voice and not make anyone think of Disney movies and singing princesses. If it was a conscious decision on the writers part they left it out, it was a wise decision if you ask me.</p><p>Now, to your other question: If Political Jon is meant to be a plot twist I doubt that we will see Jon\u2019s PoV at all as long as he stays with her, and even before that we might get Sansa\u2019s PoV more often than Jon. It could be that GRRM leaves us completely in the dark about Jonsa feelings, only giving us some hints. In this case, he would have to \u201chide\u201d behind Sansa\u2019s PoV, because I can picture Sansa being a bit oblivious about Jon\u2019s feelings and her own. If GRRM does that, it would be more easy to use Political Jon as a plot twist. GRRM could also go for a full Jonsa disclosure, describing all the angst from both PoVs, or only from Jon\u2019s PoV. My hunch is that Jon would be the first to realise his feelings, just like in the show. I think by season 6, episode 10 and the forehead kiss, Jon knows about his feelings, while Sansa only realises this after Littlefinger baited her and she stands alone on the battlements (missing Jon and looking beautiful). So, GRRM could count on the reader praying for Jon to get rid of his feelings&hellip;. It could happen for example, that the reader knows Jon has inappropriate feelings, and then he meets Da\u20acnerys and we don\u2019t see in his head. And Da\u20acnerys thinks she realises that Jon likes her and then the reader could get his hope up that Jon successfully distanced himself from Sansa - only to be surprised when they look into Jon\u2019s thoughts again.</p><p>I must admit, that it works better in my mind to not get Jon\u2019s PoV, until after Politcal Jon is revealed, but I might underestimate GRRM\u2019s ability to dupe his readers with the PoV trap. <br/></p><p>As for Jon on the boat thinking of Sansa, I would argue that he desperately tries <b>not </b>to think about Sansa. And it would indeed be a good moment to enter his thoughts again. It would be good \u201crug-pulling\u201d moment, if we as readers rooted for Jon\u20acrys as a solution, only to realise a) that Jon was after those dragons and b) that he is very far from having overcome his feelings for Sansa. <br/></p><p>You know, that is all speculation of course based on what I think would work to have the reader invested in the red herring of Jon\u20acrys, to hide Political Jon and to have the perfect moment for the parentage reveal. I mean I could see almost any scenario working but for Jon\u2019s PoV in Da\u20acnerys\u2019 presence. I think it is highly likely that Jon\u2019s PoV is hidden in his interactions with Da\u20acnerys, because Jon just can\u2019t quiet the voice of his inner sarcasm. <br/></p><p>Imagine a scene like that:</p><blockquote><p>\nLet them die,&ldquo; said Queen Selyse.\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was the answer that Jon Snow had expected. <b>This queen \nnever fails to disappoint.</b> Somehow that did not soften the blow. &quot;Your \nGrace,&rdquo; he persisted stubbornly, &ldquo;they are starving at Hardhome by the \nthousands.

If my theory that she also has a kind of musical magic is correct, then she might also help to boost the moral of the troops, reminding them what they fight for - making music that will make them weep. I doubt this will happen in the show, they have not introduced Sansa&rsquo;s singing magic in the show and they won&rsquo;t start now. It would be quite difficult actually. As much as I like the story of Beren and Luthien, I guess it would be pretty hard to make a film of a story where one of the characters has a magical singing voice and not make anyone think of Disney movies and singing princesses. If it was a conscious decision on the writers part they left it out, it was a wise decision if you ask me.</p><p>Now, to your other question: If Political Jon is meant to be a plot twist I doubt that we will see Jon&rsquo;s PoV at all as long as he stays with her, and even before that we might get Sansa&rsquo;s PoV more often than Jon. It could be that GRRM leaves us completely in the dark about Jonsa feelings, only giving us some hints. In this case, he would have to &ldquo;hide&rdquo; behind Sansa&rsquo;s PoV, because I can picture Sansa being a bit oblivious about Jon&rsquo;s feelings and her own. If GRRM does that, it would be more easy to use Political Jon as a plot twist. GRRM could also go for a full Jonsa disclosure, describing all the angst from both PoVs, or only from Jon&rsquo;s PoV. My hunch is that Jon would be the first to realise his feelings, just like in the show. I think by season 6, episode 10 and the forehead kiss, Jon knows about his feelings, while Sansa only realises this after Littlefinger baited her and she stands alone on the battlements (missing Jon and looking beautiful). So, GRRM could count on the reader praying for Jon to get rid of his feelings&hellip;. It could happen for example, that the reader knows Jon has inappropriate feelings, and then he meets Da&euro;nerys and we don&rsquo;t see in his head. And Da&euro;nerys thinks she realises that Jon likes her and then the reader could get his hope up that Jon successfully distanced himself from Sansa - only to be surprised when they look into Jon&rsquo;s thoughts again.</p><p>I must admit, that it works better in my mind to not get Jon&rsquo;s PoV, until after Politcal Jon is revealed, but I might underestimate GRRM&rsquo;s ability to dupe his readers with the PoV trap. <br /></p><p>As for Jon on the boat thinking of Sansa, I would argue that he desperately tries <b>not </b>to think about Sansa. And it would indeed be a good moment to enter his thoughts again. It would be good &ldquo;rug-pulling&rdquo; moment, if we as readers rooted for Jon&euro;rys as a solution, only to realise a) that Jon was after those dragons and b) that he is very far from having overcome his feelings for Sansa. <br /></p><p>You know, that is all speculation of course based on what I think would work to have the reader invested in the red herring of Jon&euro;rys, to hide Political Jon and to have the perfect moment for the parentage reveal. I mean I could see almost any scenario working but for Jon&rsquo;s PoV in Da&euro;nerys&rsquo; presence. I think it is highly likely that Jon&rsquo;s PoV is hidden in his interactions with Da&euro;nerys, because Jon just can&rsquo;t quiet the voice of his inner sarcasm. <br /></p><p>Imagine a scene like that:</p><blockquote><p>\nLet them die,&ldquo; said Queen Selyse.\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp;\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was the answer that Jon Snow had expected. <b>This queen \nnever fails to disappoint.</b> Somehow that did not soften the blow. \"Your \nGrace,&rdquo; he persisted stubbornly, &ldquo;they are starving at Hardhome by the \nthousands. Many are women&mdash;&rdquo;\n &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp;\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"&mdash;and children, yes. Very sad.&ldquo; The queen \npulled her daughter closer to her and kissed her cheek. The cheek \nunmarred by greyscale, Jon did not fail to note. \"We are sorry for the \nlittle ones, of course, but we must be sensible. We have no food for \nthem, and they are too young to help the king my husband in his wars. \nBetter that they be reborn into the light.&rdquo; (ADWD, Jon XIII)</p></blockquote><p>Well, then Political Jon would be out in the open pretty soon&hellip;.. So, no Jon PoV in Da&euro;nerys presence as long as Political Jon is hidden - just my guess of course.</p><p>Thanks for the ask!<br /></p>",

After all, that&rsquo;s what happened in all those other lifetimes where they found each other. But this time will be different. Because Jon will leave the Tarly household to give Sansa a chance to live happily ever after.\u00a0\u00a0</small></p><p><i><small>semi-modern au, reincarnation au</small></i></p></blockquote><p>Jon\u2019s suitcase laid open on his bed. He didn\u2019t bother to fold his clothes when he put them in it. He didn\u2019t bother to protect his books when he threw them on top. He just had to get away from here. He had to get away from here now and it didn\u2019t matter where he would go. As long as he would go far away from her she would be fine. If he would go far away from her he wouldn\u2019t end up kissing her. And if he wouldn\u2019t end up kissing her, she wouldn\u2019t die.<br/></p><p>\u201cReally, Jon?\u201d Sansa raised her eyebrows when he carried the heavy suitcase down the stairs. \u201cAm I so repulsive that you just pack your bags and leave?\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t. She truly wasn\u2019t. She was the most beautiful woman on earth. She was the kindest soul he had ever met. She was everything he wanted and even more. </p><p>He wanted her. He needed her. He longed for her. But he couldn\u2019t tell her that. He barely knew her. </p><p>She had just walked through that door yesterday as the new nanny of the Tarly children. She had worn the smile on her face he had fallen in love with so many lifetimes ago. She had carried a certain confidence in this life that suited her. And she had also been bolder than she used to be, as if a fire within her had driven her straight into his arms.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t a fire. It wasn\u2019t desire. It wasn\u2019t a burning passion. It was a curse. </p><p>They would fall in love. They would kiss and then he would live on while she would die in his arms.</p><p>But not anymore. Not this time. Not in this life.</p><p>In this life Sansa would live long, very long. She would fall in love with someone else. She would kiss him without dying. She would make love to him. She would become a mother and then eventually she would die of old age. </p><!-- more --><p>He owed her that. He owed her one life without him. He owed her one life that lasted longer than the few years she usually got. He owed her one life where she would not meet disaster when she believed to have found her happily ever after.</p><p>\u201cYou can at least talk to me!\u201d She raised her voice and clenched her hands to fists.</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;ve got a new job, Sansa. That\u2019s all. It\u2019s nothing personal.\u201d He shrugged and headed for the front door, but Sansa jumped in between him and the way out.</p><p>\u201cYou have?\u201d She crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cAnd when did you apply for it? Why didn\u2019t you tell me yesterday, when you introduced yourself as the head of the household? When didn\u2019t you tell me last night, when we walked through the garden and had a conversation that made me believe that maybe there could grow more between us?\u201d</p><p>Jon swallowed. \u201cWe barely know each other, Sansa. I\u2019m not gonna share such things with a stranger.\u201d He wanted to walk past her, but Sansa once more blocked his path. </p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t talk like strangers do. You didn\u2019t behave like a stranger does.\u201d She lifted her chin and straightened her back. </p><p>Jon placed his suitcase on the stone cold floor. \u201cWhy does it matter, Sansa?

She truly wasn&rsquo;t. She was the most beautiful woman on earth. She was the kindest soul he had ever met. She was everything he wanted and even more. </p><p>He wanted her. He needed her. He longed for her. But he couldn&rsquo;t tell her that. He barely knew her. </p><p>She had just walked through that door yesterday as the new nanny of the Tarly children. She had worn the smile on her face he had fallen in love with so many lifetimes ago. She had carried a certain confidence in this life that suited her. And she had also been bolder than she used to be, as if a fire within her had driven her straight into his arms.</p><p>But it wasn&rsquo;t a fire. It wasn&rsquo;t desire. It wasn&rsquo;t a burning passion. It was a curse. </p><p>They would fall in love. They would kiss and then he would live on while she would die in his arms.</p><p>But not anymore. Not this time. Not in this life.</p><p>In this life Sansa would live long, very long. She would fall in love with someone else. She would kiss him without dying. She would make love to him. She would become a mother and then eventually she would die of old age. </p><p>He owed her that. He owed her one life without him. He owed her one life that lasted longer than the few years she usually got. He owed her one life where she would not meet disaster when she believed to have found her happily ever after.</p><p>&ldquo;You can at least talk to me!&rdquo; She raised her voice and clenched her hands to fists.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a new job, Sansa. That&rsquo;s all. It&rsquo;s nothing personal.&rdquo; He shrugged and headed for the front door, but Sansa jumped in between him and the way out.</p><p>&ldquo;You have?&rdquo; She crossed her arms over her chest. &ldquo;And when did you apply for it? Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me yesterday, when you introduced yourself as the head of the household? When didn&rsquo;t you tell me last night, when we walked through the garden and had a conversation that made me believe that maybe there could grow more between us?&rdquo;</p><p>Jon swallowed. &ldquo;We barely know each other, Sansa. I&rsquo;m not gonna share such things with a stranger.&rdquo; He wanted to walk past her, but Sansa once more blocked his path. </p><p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t talk like strangers do. You didn&rsquo;t behave like a stranger does.&rdquo; She lifted her chin and straightened her back. </p><p>Jon placed his suitcase on the stone cold floor. &ldquo;Why does it matter, Sansa? You are the new nanny here, I have a new job.&rdquo; He sounded harsh, way harsher than he liked to be, but it was for her own good. This was the only way to give her a life, a long life, a happy life, a life without him. &ldquo;We had some nice talks yesterday and it was great to get to know you, but now I move on.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you.&rdquo; Sansa hissed between her teeth. &ldquo;You would have said something when you introduced yourself to me.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon shook his head. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know me. How do you know what I&rsquo;d do?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I just know this is not like you!&rdquo; She screamed now and Jon firmly grabbed her wrists.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re waking up the kids and the entire house.&rdquo; He whispered. </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to say goodbye to them? Or didn&rsquo;t you tell them either that you were leaving?&rdquo; Sansa cocked her head and she locked her glance with his. </p><p>For once he really wanted to do the right thing instead of the selfish thing. </p><p>And now she chose this moment to be difficult. &ldquo;The truth, Jon Snow.&rdquo; Her nose was dangerously close to his. &ldquo;Why do I feel like I know you? And why do you leave like a thief in the night just after I&rsquo;ve arrived and we&rsquo;ve had this amazing evening?&rdquo;</p><p>Jon swallowed. He was out of lies and out of excuses. And he was afraid that even if he managed to come up with one, she still wouldn&rsquo;t believe him. &ldquo;Because you&rsquo;ll die when I kiss you.&rdquo; He blurted the words out and reluctantly he stared at Sansa&rsquo;s face.</p><p>Her eyes widened. Her jaw dropped. She opened her mouth to say something, but closed it again, most likely because the right words simply didn&rsquo;t want to come. </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re cursed. We meet life after life after life. And every time we kiss you die.&rdquo; His heart almost broke through his ribcage and he could hear the blood rushing through his own veins. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t want that anymore. I don&rsquo;t want to kill you. Not this time.&rdquo;</p><p>She still stared at him without saying a word and then she wrapped her arms around him and pressed her lips on his. </p><p>Jon froze. He tensed all his muscles and tried to push her away.</p><p>But Sansa didn&rsquo;t let him. She kept her lips firmly on his and he felt his resistance falter. </p><p>His hands slid around her waist and he closed his eyes while he opened his mouth to let her tongue in. And he waited. He waited and waited and waited, until she would stop moving, would stop breathing, would stop living.</p><p>But she didn&rsquo;t. She pressed her entire body to his and for the first time in many many years a genuine smile appeared on his face. </p><p>He wasn&rsquo;t sure how long it would last. He wasn&rsquo;t sure how far they could go this time. But he would take whatever he could get. </p></p>",

Joffrey Baratheon, menstrual cramps in human form, still enjoys killing kittens and torturing Sansa Stark. Jaime Lannister is on his way back to King&rsquo;s Landing ahead of the TV show&rsquo;s schedule, his arrival soon giving way to his betrothal to Sansa, very much a wolf in the skin of a little bird.</p><p>Whether or not you ship it, an alternate universe would have seen the Red Wolf and the Young Lion as the most powerfully matched and well-developed couple in Westeros, and I certainly intend on taking you through a journey of enmity, angst and denial: and soon, oh, so much more.</p><p>Words: 14, Chapters: 1/?, Language: English</p><ul><li>Fandoms: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Game%20of%20Thrones%20(TV)/works\">Game of Thrones (TV)</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/A%20Song%20of%20Ice%20and%20Fire%20-%20George%20R*d*%20R*d*%20Martin/works\">A Song of Ice and Fire - George R.
