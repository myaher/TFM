This is my blog, which I make no promise to keep up with. I'm a bisexual Autistic. Also have ADD. I like cephalopods, especially cuttlefish, and plants, and reading, and many other geeky things. </p><p>More random tidbit: feminist, somewhere in the left politically, and tired of the political landscape but still trying to care. Also a lapsed pagan, it sounds like nonsense but idk how else to describe it. More things- gluten free, and crochet, knitting, and others. Beware of my many random posts as well.</p><p>That is all for now! </p><p>Oh BTW I am bad at tagging things, trying to get better, but its a work in progress.</p>",
