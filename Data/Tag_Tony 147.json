May didn&rsquo;t look up, but chuckled, and Peter rolled his eyes in frustration.</p><p>&ldquo;Who are you meeting with?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony Stark. Well, Stark Industries. It&rsquo;s normally Pepper Potts, but apparently she&rsquo;s on her honeymoon, and these contracts really can&rsquo;t wait for her to get back.&rdquo;</p><p>Which was how Peter found himself sitting on a chair in the corner of the boardroom, trying to feign interest as May made her presentation to Stark Industries, when really all he could think about was how delicious Tony Stark looked in his suit. Everything about him just oozed power and confidence, and it made Peter want to drop to his knees and<i> beg</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;I adore hearing you talk business, miss Parker.&rdquo; Tony drawled, grin etched onto his face as May raised an unimpressed eyebrow, and Peter felt himself practically salivate.&nbsp;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing like a woman who knows what she&rsquo;s doing in the boardroom.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As much as I adore your unending flattery, mister Stark,&rdquo; May deadpanned,&nbsp;&ldquo;do we have a feasible deal, here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Tony nodded,&nbsp;&ldquo;if you could send the drafts over to my lawyers, I&rsquo;ll get them back to you as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter stood with the rest of the room as May and Tony shook hands, and was preparing to leave, until he heard Tony speak again.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Is that your nephew?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Indeed it is. It does him good to sit in on meetings occasionally, get a feel for how the business works.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony hummed in agreement, and Peter felt himself suddenly weak at the knees as Tony pinned him with an unwavering stare, assessing him like he was a piece of meat. If it were anyone else, Peter would have bristled, pulled himself up and stared right back, but there was something domineering in the older man&rsquo;s gaze that made him just want to bow his head and obey.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You in college, kid?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;First year?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Second.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Business studies?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No sir. Biomechanical engineering.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Interesting. MIT? Princeton? Yale?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;MIT, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, truly the best of the best, mister Parker.&rdquo; Tony grinned, and levelled Peter with a playful look.&nbsp;&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;d like to hop over to Stark Industries at some point, come and take a look at the R&amp;D floors? With the permission of your scarily efficient aunt, of course.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s- um- that&rsquo;s-&rdquo; An encouraging look in the form of a raised eyebrow and a half smile from May had Peter nodding, making better eye contact with his shoes than with the man in front of him.&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;d be great, mister Stark, thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Great! I&rsquo;ll have my people get in contact with your people. I look forward to seeing you again, Parker.&rdquo;</p><p>With a dazzling grin and a clap on Peter&rsquo;s shoulder that lingered fractionally longer than it should have done, Tony was gone, followed quickly and silently by his entourage.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Well that was interesting.&rdquo; May mused, making a point of keeping her eyes on her phone screen as they left the boardroom, saving Peter&rsquo;s blushing face some dignity.&nbsp;&ldquo;He certainly took a shine to you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s like that with everyone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m sure he is.

I have so much more lined up for this story but it\u2019s a long piece so I decided to break it up into parts. Nonetheless, thank you so much for allowing me to take part in this challenge!!! Also apologies that it\u2019s a day late!! :(\u00a0<br/></p><p><b>Summary: </b>Sometimes all it takes is one boy to change everyone\u2019s lives, and his name\u2019s Peter Parker. This is his story.\u00a0</p><p><b>Warnings: </b>bad language, angst, violence, shooting</p><p><b>Word Count:</b> 2070 words</p><hr><p>Facing the dull window of his office, Anthony\nswirled the whiskey in his glass as he allowed himself to dissolve in deep\nthought yet again. The window was covered in blinds which allowed ever so\nlittle light to peak through the short gaps. Just like in this moment,\neverything in the man&rsquo;s life has always been so black and white and grey. </p><p>A loud knock on the door woke him from his\nthoughts, as the sound echoed throughout the poorly-lit office.</p><p>Anthony turned in his chair, facing his desk yet\nagain. With his peace of mind now gone, he yanked down the glass onto the\ntable\u2019s surface causing some of the liquid to escape and spill over the rim of\nthe glass. He wasn&rsquo;t going to get a break today or ever really. The man wanted\nto get away from his infamous occupation, but that was where life placed him\nand that was where he would remain. </p><p>His father was once a powerful mobster himself,\nas of now he laid six feet underground with no power whatsoever. The man hated\nhis father with a passion for his terror-filled childhood. Everyone feared that\nawful man, his own son probably the most. Anthony had no choice but to carry on\nhis father&rsquo;s illegal business to fulfill his legacy. He was never harsh or a man\nfull of hatred unlike his father, but when he heard of the murder of his\nparents, in particularly of his mother, that was the final straw. He swore he&rsquo;d\nfind the bastard and take his revenge. </p><p>&ldquo;Come on in!&rdquo; he shouted at the door,\ninterrupting the peaceful silence of his office.</p><p>The door slowly proceeded to open with an awful\ncreak filling the room from the movement, only to reveal a man stepping into\nthe office from behind it. He wasn&rsquo;t nervous. No, these men weren&rsquo;t the nervous\ntype. </p><p>He wore a simple grey fedora hat along with a boring\ngrey suit. At least the white shirt he wore along with a black tie added some\ncolour to his dull attire. </p><p>Motioning to the seat in front of him for the man\nto sit down, Anthony sat back in his seat. Filling the once quiet office with\nhis harsh tone of voice, a fire lit in his eyes. &ldquo;Well, are you gonna talk\ntoday or just waste my time?&rdquo;</p><!-- more --><p>Removing the fedora from his head, the other man\nfinally sat down. It was clear that the infamous Anthony Stark was beginning to\ngrow impatient waiting for him to spit out whatever it was he had to spit out. </p><p>&ldquo;With all respect sir, Banner had noticed\nsomeone wandering \u2018round your warehouse in the south of the city.&rdquo; </p><p>The mobster behind the desk was quick to slam his\nhand down forcefully, welcoming the silence to re-fill his office once again. Of\ncourse, he wouldn\u2019t be happy to know that there was someone snooping around his\nwarehouse, especially since that one held several amounts of powerful weaponry.\nAllowing a moment to pass for some careful thinking, it was a no-brainer of\nwhat he should do. </p><p>Standing up from his seat, he was quick to grab\nhis long coat from the hanger by the door, wrapping it over his own suited\nattire. Placing his own hat on his head, he paced past the man to the door only\nto stop briefly before leaving his office. </p><p>&ldquo;You better be right\u2026 or you know the\nconsequences&rdquo; he pointed to him in a threatening manner, leaving the man\nwith a cold chill behind. </p><p>Anthony hated being disturbed, but he certainly\nhated thieving bastards more than anything else. Grabbing the keys to his\nvehicle, he made his way out towards the car. </p><p>The street outside seemed empty enough, probably\ndue to the dull clouds and the rainfall they carried with them. Well, it seemed\nalmost empty apart from the one lady that walked along the path, pushing a\nbuggy. </p><p>The mobster had to admit that it was strange to\nsee a young lady out on a walk with her baby in the rain. Instead of hopping\ninto his car and hurrying down to his warehouse, he decided to run up to the\nlady. A minute or two wouldn&rsquo;t hurt.</p><p>&ldquo;Ma'am it&rsquo;s a bad time to be walking a baby\nnow is it not?&rdquo;</p><p>The lady stopped in her tracks and looked up at\nthe man in front of her. She recognised his face, anyone in this part of the\ncity would&rsquo;ve. She, like many others heard several infamous stories about him\nbut she had a heart of gold and decided not to judge unless she saw it herself.\n</p><p>Sending the man, a gentle smile she responded,\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you have more important things to worry about than a lady in the\nrain Mr. Stark.&rdquo;</p><p>He returned the smile as he walked on beside her.\nIt was at very rare occasions that he would smile a genuine smile and yet here\nit danced along his lips. \u201cA little bit of rain? Perhaps not, yet it\u2019s\nabsolutely pouring \u2026 uh\u201d he breathed \u201cI don\u2019t believe I quite caught your\nname\u201d.</p><p>Continuing her way, she let a small chuckle to\nescape \u201cThat\u2019s perhaps because I never told you\u201d.</p><p>Allowing another grin to pass, the man decided to\nhalt in his tracks. He couldn\u2019t deny that the sweet stranger had caught his attention,\nbut he really had to go to check on the warehouse. </p><p>To his surprise the beautiful lady decided to\nstop also, only to turn and face him. \u201cMay\u201d she smiled, and when she did, he\nswore that her smile could make all the clouds go away along with any gloomy\ngreys that filled his dark life. </p><p>\u201cLet me at least get you an umbrella. I don\u2019t\nwant your baby to get sick\u201d he told her as he took a quick peak under the hood\nof the pram. The baby inside it laid fast asleep while holding tightly onto the\ncorner of the blanket that covered him. He looked quite snug inside despite the\ncool air from the outside. It was clear that May had taken the cold into\nconsideration before the walk and made sure that the baby was prepared for the\nharsh weather.</p><p>Looking in at the little boy, so soft and\ninnocent, Anthony couldn\u2019t lie \u2013 the sight warmed his cold heart.</p><p>\u201cOh no no, he\u2019s not-\u201d she smiled following his\nline of sight \u201c-this little darling is my neph-\u201d </p><p>Just before the beautiful lady had the chance to\nfinish her sentence, the mobster\u2019s ears rang from the sound of a gunshot. <i>Before</i> he had the chance to react and\npull the woman (who managed to capture his heart within seconds) behind him, he\nnoticed the little puddle of red emerging over her chest. </p><p>Looking down at the patch that now stained her\ndress, she pressed her hand to it, only to bring it up to her line of sight and\ninspect the foreign warm liquid on her fingers. Unable to muster any words, she\nlooked directly into Anthony\u2019s eyes, the simple eye contact communicating a\nthousand words. </p><p>The sound of two more gunshots filled the tense\natmosphere, however the woman in front of him was now his primary concern. </p><p>He didn\u2019t need her to say anything, he was quick\nto step up and catch her before she grew weak and her legs finally gave in\nunderneath her. Falling to the ground with the gracious woman now dying in his\narms, he reached one hand into the inside of his jacket to pull out his gun.\nLooking around he tried to figure out where the damned coward who shot this\nangel hid, but to no effect. Men knew better than to miss when aiming at <i>the</i> Anthony Stark, so it wouldn\u2019t have\nbeen a surprise to him if whoever did it decided to scramble away immediately.</p><p>Reassuring himself that there wasn\u2019t a soul\npresent, he turned his attention back to May. She laid motionlessly, her pale\nface staring up at him stuck in its lifeless expression. Allowing a low curse\nto escape, he followed the trail of her arm up to where her hand loosely remained\nagainst the buggy. </p><p>It was at that moment that he realised what had happened.\nA young woman\u2019s life had been taken from her, leaving her baby boy behind all\nalone.</p><p>The little child that had been asleep merely\nseconds ago, had woken with the sound of the gunshot, his cries now clashing\nwith the sound of the heavy rain. </p><p>The gangster didn\u2019t know what to do. He was left\non an empty street with a crying baby and without a doubt, a sense of guilt\nthat an innocent woman had taken the bullet that was aimed for him. </p><p>Perhaps it was the guilt inside of him, or the\nfact that he knew what it was like to lose a mother due to such sickening\nactions, but when he looked at that baby, he knew somewhere deep down inside\nthat he couldn\u2019t leave him on his own. He sensed that he now had some\nresponsibility to look after him.</p><p>Gently resting the woman down on the pavement\nnearby, the man got up and leaned in to pick up the boy from the pram. As he\nheld him, the child slowly began to ease off on his cries, opening his eyes to\nlook up at the man that was carrying him. </p><p>Anthony couldn\u2019t lie it felt strange, but the way\nthe child\u2019s eyes glistened, he knew he was doing the right thing. </p><p>Carrying the boy back into the building he\npreviously left from, he was quick to yell at his men from the entrance door. </p><p>\u201cLISTEN UP! THERE\u2019S A LADY LYING DEAD ACROSS THE\nSTREET, I WANT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU TO GO FIND OUT WHAT YOU POSSIBLY CAN\nABOUT HER AND WHOEVER F*CKING DARED TO SHOOT HER. SEARCH THE AREA, FIND THEM\nAND BRING THEM TO ME!\u201d </p><p>He paused to look down briefly at the little boy\nin his arms, seeing that the shouting wasn\u2019t affecting him, he decided to\ncontinue to roar his commands. \u201cRHODES, HOGAN, I WANT HER TO GET A PROPER\nBURIAL. I\u2019M HEADING DOWN TO THE WAREHOUSE, I WANT THIS SORTED BEFORE I GET\nBACK!\u201d</p><p>Despite the confused looks and shouts he received\nfrom the men inside, Stark left them all behind without any other word. Hopping\ninto the car with the child still in his arms, he went on in his awkward drive\nto the south of the city. </p><p>Although the ride was rather challenging, he had\neventually reached his other premises wherein he held the weaponry. </p><p>The main man in charge of safe-guarding the\nplace, Banner, was quick to jog up to him upon his arrival.</p><p>\u201cTony\u201d he spoke up, ready to explain what had\nhappened. Banner was one of the very few men who could call Anthony by his\nname.</p><p>The mobster however gave him a quick dismissing\nwave \u201cBruce, that can wait.\u201d </p><p>It was at that moment that his friend noticed the\nlittle boy. Seeing that he was ready to ask questions, Stark was quick to speak\nagain. \u201cYou have a little daughter, yeah?\u201d</p><p>Bruce nodded. \u201cYeah, yeah. Y/N. She\u2019s only a few\nmonths old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis boy, he has no one that I know of right\nnow, his mother was shot in my presence. I\u2019m trying to find out who he is, for\nany family at all but until then I need your help to look after him.\u201d</p><p>Bruce agreed to take on the responsibility to look after him for a short while. That was\nuntil weeks later it became apparent of who the child was. The boy was little\nPeter Parker, and the woman that was shot on the spot wasn\u2019t in fact his mother\u2026\nit was his aunt.</p><p>Anthony and his men tried to trace down any other\nfamily of his, but the woman was the last traceable guardian left\u2026 he\ntruly had no one at all. With little to no options left in the fate of the child,\nthe mobster took on the responsibility to take care of him and raise the boy. He\ntook him under his wing to give him a proper shot at life rather than to leave\nhim at an orphanage. </p><p>That decision on the man\u2019s behalf was certainly\none Peter grew eternally thankful for as years passed by. </p>",

It was clear that the infamous Anthony Stark was beginning to\ngrow impatient waiting for him to spit out whatever it was he had to spit out. </p><p>\u201cWith all respect sir, Banner had noticed\nsomeone wandering \u2018round your warehouse in the south of the city.\u201d </p><p>The mobster behind the desk was quick to slam his\nhand down forcefully, welcoming the silence to re-fill his office once again. Of\ncourse, he wouldn\u2019t be happy to know that there was someone snooping around his\nwarehouse, especially since that one held several amounts of powerful weaponry.\nAllowing a moment to pass for some careful thinking, it was a no-brainer of\nwhat he should do. </p><p>Standing up from his seat, he was quick to grab\nhis long coat from the hanger by the door, wrapping it over his own suited\nattire. Placing his own hat on his head, he paced past the man to the door only\nto stop briefly before leaving his office. </p><p>\u201cYou better be right\u2026 or you know the\nconsequences\u201d he pointed to him in a threatening manner, leaving the man\nwith a cold chill behind. </p><p>Anthony hated being disturbed, but he certainly\nhated thieving bastards more than anything else. Grabbing the keys to his\nvehicle, he made his way out towards the car. </p><p>The street outside seemed empty enough, probably\ndue to the dull clouds and the rainfall they carried with them. Well, it seemed\nalmost empty apart from the one lady that walked along the path, pushing a\nbuggy. </p><p>The mobster had to admit that it was strange to\nsee a young lady out on a walk with her baby in the rain. Instead of hopping\ninto his car and hurrying down to his warehouse, he decided to run up to the\nlady. A minute or two wouldn\u2019t hurt.</p><p>\u201cMa'am it\u2019s a bad time to be walking a baby\nnow is it not?\u201d</p><p>The lady stopped in her tracks and looked up at\nthe man in front of her.

Of\ncourse, he wouldn\u2019t be happy to know that there was someone snooping around his\nwarehouse, especially since that one held several amounts of powerful weaponry.\nAllowing a moment to pass for some careful thinking, it was a no-brainer of\nwhat he should do. </p><p>Standing up from his seat, he was quick to grab\nhis long coat from the hanger by the door, wrapping it over his own suited\nattire. Placing his own hat on his head, he paced past the man to the door only\nto stop briefly before leaving his office. </p><p>\u201cYou better be right\u2026 or you know the\nconsequences\u201d he pointed to him in a threatening manner, leaving the man\nwith a cold chill behind. </p><p>Anthony hated being disturbed, but he certainly\nhated thieving bastards more than anything else. Grabbing the keys to his\nvehicle, he made his way out towards the car. </p><p>The street outside seemed empty enough, probably\ndue to the dull clouds and the rainfall they carried with them. Well, it seemed\nalmost empty apart from the one lady that walked along the path, pushing a\nbuggy. </p><p>The mobster had to admit that it was strange to\nsee a young lady out on a walk with her baby in the rain. Instead of hopping\ninto his car and hurrying down to his warehouse, he decided to run up to the\nlady. A minute or two wouldn\u2019t hurt.</p><p>\u201cMa'am it\u2019s a bad time to be walking a baby\nnow is it not?\u201d</p><p>The lady stopped in her tracks and looked up at\nthe man in front of her. She recognised his face, anyone in this part of the\ncity would\u2019ve. She, like many others heard several infamous stories about him\nbut she had a heart of gold and decided not to judge unless she saw it herself.\n</p><p>Sending the man, a gentle smile she responded,\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you have more important things to worry about than a lady in the\nrain Mr. Stark.\u201d</p><p>He returned the smile as he walked on beside her.\nIt was at very rare occasions that he would smile a genuine smile and yet here\nit danced along his lips. \u201cA little bit of rain? Perhaps not, yet it\u2019s\nabsolutely pouring \u2026 uh\u201d he breathed \u201cI don\u2019t believe I quite caught your\nname\u201d.</p><p>Continuing her way, she let a small chuckle to\nescape \u201cThat\u2019s perhaps because I never told you\u201d.</p><p>Allowing another grin to pass, the man decided to\nhalt in his tracks. He couldn\u2019t deny that the sweet stranger had caught his attention,\nbut he really had to go to check on the warehouse. </p><p>To his surprise the beautiful lady decided to\nstop also, only to turn and face him. \u201cMay\u201d she smiled, and when she did, he\nswore that her smile could make all the clouds go away along with any gloomy\ngreys that filled his dark life. </p><p>\u201cLet me at least get you an umbrella. I don\u2019t\nwant your baby to get sick\u201d he told her as he took a quick peak under the hood\nof the pram. The baby inside it laid fast asleep while holding tightly onto the\ncorner of the blanket that covered him. He looked quite snug inside despite the\ncool air from the outside. It was clear that May had taken the cold into\nconsideration before the walk and made sure that the baby was prepared for the\nharsh weather.</p><p>Looking in at the little boy, so soft and\ninnocent, Anthony couldn\u2019t lie \u2013 the sight warmed his cold heart.</p><p>\u201cOh no no, he\u2019s not-\u201d she smiled following his\nline of sight \u201c-this little darling is my neph-\u201d </p><p>Just before the beautiful lady had the chance to\nfinish her sentence, the mobster\u2019s ears rang from the sound of a gunshot. <i>Before</i> he had the chance to react and\npull the woman (who managed to capture his heart within seconds) behind him, he\nnoticed the little puddle of red emerging over her chest. </p><p>Looking down at the patch that now stained her\ndress, she pressed her hand to it, only to bring it up to her line of sight and\ninspect the foreign warm liquid on her fingers. Unable to muster any words, she\nlooked directly into Anthony\u2019s eyes, the simple eye contact communicating a\nthousand words. </p><p>The sound of two more gunshots filled the tense\natmosphere, however the woman in front of him was now his primary concern. </p><p>He didn\u2019t need her to say anything, he was quick\nto step up and catch her before she grew weak and her legs finally gave in\nunderneath her. Falling to the ground with the gracious woman now dying in his\narms, he reached one hand into the inside of his jacket to pull out his gun.\nLooking around he tried to figure out where the damned coward who shot this\nangel hid, but to no effect. Men knew better than to miss when aiming at <i>the</i> Anthony Stark, so it wouldn\u2019t have\nbeen a surprise to him if whoever did it decided to scramble away immediately.</p><p>Reassuring himself that there wasn\u2019t a soul\npresent, he turned his attention back to May. She laid motionlessly, her pale\nface staring up at him stuck in its lifeless expression. Allowing a low curse\nto escape, he followed the trail of her arm up to where her hand loosely remained\nagainst the buggy. </p><p>It was at that moment that he realised what had happened.\nA young woman\u2019s life had been taken from her, leaving her baby boy behind all\nalone.</p><p>The little child that had been asleep merely\nseconds ago, had woken with the sound of the gunshot, his cries now clashing\nwith the sound of the heavy rain. </p><p>The gangster didn\u2019t know what to do. He was left\non an empty street with a crying baby and without a doubt, a sense of guilt\nthat an innocent woman had taken the bullet that was aimed for him. </p><p>Perhaps it was the guilt inside of him, or the\nfact that he knew what it was like to lose a mother due to such sickening\nactions, but when he looked at that baby, he knew somewhere deep down inside\nthat he couldn\u2019t leave him on his own. He sensed that he now had some\nresponsibility to look after him.</p><p>Gently resting the woman down on the pavement\nnearby, the man got up and leaned in to pick up the boy from the pram. As he\nheld him, the child slowly began to ease off on his cries, opening his eyes to\nlook up at the man that was carrying him. </p><p>Anthony couldn\u2019t lie it felt strange, but the way\nthe child\u2019s eyes glistened, he knew he was doing the right thing. </p><p>Carrying the boy back into the building he\npreviously left from, he was quick to yell at his men from the entrance door. </p><p>\u201cLISTEN UP! THERE\u2019S A LADY LYING DEAD ACROSS THE\nSTREET, I WANT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU TO GO FIND OUT WHAT YOU POSSIBLY CAN\nABOUT HER AND WHOEVER F*CKING DARED TO SHOOT HER. SEARCH THE AREA, FIND THEM\nAND BRING THEM TO ME!\u201d </p><p>He paused to look down briefly at the little boy\nin his arms, seeing that the shouting wasn\u2019t affecting him, he decided to\ncontinue to roar his commands. \u201cRHODES, HOGAN, I WANT HER TO GET A PROPER\nBURIAL. I\u2019M HEADING DOWN TO THE WAREHOUSE, I WANT THIS SORTED BEFORE I GET\nBACK!\u201d</p><p>Despite the confused looks and shouts he received\nfrom the men inside, Stark left them all behind without any other word. Hopping\ninto the car with the child still in his arms, he went on in his awkward drive\nto the south of the city. </p><p>Although the ride was rather challenging, he had\neventually reached his other premises wherein he held the weaponry. </p><p>The main man in charge of safe-guarding the\nplace, Banner, was quick to jog up to him upon his arrival.</p><p>\u201cTony\u201d he spoke up, ready to explain what had\nhappened. Banner was one of the very few men who could call Anthony by his\nname.</p><p>The mobster however gave him a quick dismissing\nwave \u201cBruce, that can wait.\u201d </p><p>It was at that moment that his friend noticed the\nlittle boy. Seeing that he was ready to ask questions, Stark was quick to speak\nagain. \u201cYou have a little daughter, yeah?\u201d</p><p>Bruce nodded. \u201cYeah, yeah. Y/N. She\u2019s only a few\nmonths old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis boy, he has no one that I know of right\nnow, his mother was shot in my presence. I\u2019m trying to find out who he is, for\nany family at all but until then I need your help to look after him.\u201d</p><p>Bruce agreed to take on the responsibility to look after him for a short while. That was\nuntil weeks later it became apparent of who the child was. The boy was little\nPeter Parker, and the woman that was shot on the spot wasn\u2019t in fact his mother\u2026\nit was his aunt.</p><p>Anthony and his men tried to trace down any other\nfamily of his, but the woman was the last traceable guardian left\u2026 he\ntruly had no one at all. With little to no options left in the fate of the child,\nthe mobster took on the responsibility to take care of him and raise the boy. He\ntook him under his wing to give him a proper shot at life rather than to leave\nhim at an orphanage. </p><p>That decision on the man\u2019s behalf was certainly\none Peter grew eternally thankful for as years passed by. </p>",
