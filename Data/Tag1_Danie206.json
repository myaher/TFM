He watched the shivering patrons enter the bar and shrug off their heavy coats, ordering drinks and relishing in the fact that they weren&rsquo;t out in the cold anymore.</p><p>Any of this people would be easy prey for him. He\u2019s done this countless times before, seduce some poor soul whose drunk out of their mind and take them back to his place. He wasn\u2019t a monster, he never took advantage of anyone in their inebriated state and most of the time they passed out before anything could ever happen. And that is when he fed.</p><p>Over the years he had become accustomed to shutting off his emotions and getting what needs to be done, done. It was hard to feel anything when you needed to drain people of their blood to merely survive.</p><p>When he was younger - or when he was made - he had trouble stopping when drinking from his victims and it had gotten so bad that at one point he\u2019d lost count of how many people he&rsquo;d accidentally bleed dry. \u00a0</p><p>For the first part of his vampire life, he had run with a nest of vampires that massacred the humans they fed on. They had been much older than him and had given in to what they liked to call their \u201cnatural Instincts.\u201d They could care less about the innocent souls they took, and some of those taken were merely for the pleasure of it.</p><p>But that had ended one day when their nest had been invaded and they had been hunted down and slaughtered, just like the countless people they had slaughtered. As it turns out a small village nearby had realized what was going on when their people started going missing. They\u2019d waited until one really sunny afternoon and struck, taking no mercy on the creatures who\u2019d attacked their village. Luckily Dan preferred to sleep under the soil than \u201ccoffins\u201d so he was left on accident by the villagers who had no idea he was buried in the backyard. The attack on his nest had been enough to \u201csober\u201d him up enough to not turn his emotions completely off but enough that he didn\u2019t have to feel anything while he killed his victims.</p><p>It was only when he had met his best friend PJ that Dan finally allowed himself to start feeling again. And it was PJ who had taught him self-control and started teaching him that they were no better than the humans and that they all could live in harmony with each other.</p><p>Since becoming a vampire, his sense of time has become distorted. He doesn\u2019t know exactly how long he and PJ had been together but it had been long enough that they developed a strong friendship over the years.</p><p>About a year ago he and PJ had been out stalking the streets looking for dinner to push them over for a few days when they spotted a man wandering the streets. He was the only viable prey they had seen all nights so neither one of them had stopped to question why he might be such easy prey.</p><p>Dan had stood off to the side waiting for his turn to feed as PJ had been the one who had his sharp teeth sunk into the man\u2019s neck. Out of nowhere the man had pulled a wooden stake out of his coat pocket and struck PJ straight in the chest. Dan had watched in horror as his best friend and mentor tumbled to the ground. The man had trouble pulling the stake out of PJ\u2019s lifeless body which had given Dan just enough time to escape. Ever since that night, he was very careful about who he chose for prey, which is why he tended to hand out in bars and only taking home extremely wasted people.</p><p>Dan sat at a table in the back of the bar watching people drink and dirty dance and grind against each other. He had his eye on this one blonde woman all night. She had come into the bar alone and continued to sit there alone all night as she downed drink after drink.</p><p>It was nearing midnight and he figured he better make his move as the bar would soon be closing and he didn\u2019t want to take the chance of losing a feed tonight. With stealth, he made his way up to the bar and stood next to the women. He was getting ready to make his move when a sweet cinnamon smell overpowered his senses. Whipping his head around to look he noticed a man who looked to be in his early thirties with striking blue eyes and raven black hair, that was pushed up into a quiff onto his forehead. He wore a red plaid shirt that Dan could see under his coat and a pair of blue skinny jeans. Dan&rsquo;s mouth watered with want, he\u2019d never smelt anything as pleasant before.</p><p>The man walked right up next to him and turned to the bartender ordering his drink.</p><p><i><b>\u201cI\u2019ll have a margarita please.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cSure thing mate,\u201d </b></i>the bartender responded as he set to work making the man\u2019s drink.</p><p>With the blonde women completely forgotten, Dan sat down next to him.</p><p><i><b>\u201cI\u2019ll have an old fashion,</b></i>\u201d he said, throwing a couple of bills at the man, <i><b>\u201cI\u2019ll buy his too,\u201d</b></i> he said pointing to the man next to him.</p><p><i><b>\u201cOh no you don\u2019t have to do that,\u201d</b></i> the raven-haired man turned to him.</p><p><i><b>\u201cHonestly it\u2019s no problem. I have more money then I know what to do with anyway,\u201d </b></i>if Dan could have blushed he would have at the ridiculousness of his comment.</p><p><i><b>\u201cWell if you insist.\u201d</b></i> The man shrugged his shoulders now turning to the drink the bartender just sat down in front of him.</p><p><i><b>\u201cI\u2019m Dan by the way,\u201d </b></i>Dan shyly said.</p><p><i><b>\u201cPhil,\u201d </b></i>the man grinned at him.</p><p>He and Phil sat at the bar for over two hours just talking, he\u2019d learned they had quite a lot in common, well that was other than Dan was a bloodthirsty vampire and Phil wasn&rsquo;t. Not that he indulged this information to Phil. Over the two hours, the continued to drink, Phil becoming drunker as the time went on and Dan would have been too if he wasn\u2019t an immortal creature.</p><p>Normally he wouldn\u2019t talk and get to know his victims before feeding, it went along with not wanting to feel anything for them but Phil was different. Dan found himself forgetting about the constant hunger that he usually always felt. In fact, Dan found himself not wanting to feed on Phil at all, but instead drag him back to his apartment and instead elect to crush Phil at Mario Kart, which Dan was thrilled to learn was one of Phil\u2019s favorite games.</p><p>Dan giggled at something Phil just said when out of the blue Phil leaned over and whispered, \u201cHow about we get out of here, go back to my place?\u201d</p><p>Dan knew he shouldn\u2019t agree but there was something magnetic about Phil that just wouldn\u2019t allow him to say no. He hastily nodded his head. Phil smiled cheekily and paid the bartender for the last drinks they had just had.</p><p>The cab ride to Phil\u2019s apartment was quiet but Dan knew both of them could feel the electricity in the air. Dan had never been nervous like this before, his hands shook and if his heart would have been beating he knows it would be rapidly pumping.</p><p>Phil paid the cab driver and took a hold of Dan\u2019s hand, pulling him out of the backseat.</p><p><i><b>\u201cSo yeah, here it is.</b></i>\u201d Phil nervously rocked on his feet pointing to the building.</p><p><b><i>\u201cSo\u2026 are you going to invite me up?\u201d </i></b>Dan asked him nervously.</p><p><i><b>\u201cOh yeah, of course, umm do you want to come up?\u201d</b></i></p><p>Grinning Dan shook his head yes. A relieved look broke out onto Phil&rsquo;s face, \u201c<i><b>Well come on then follow me.\u201d</b></i></p><p>It didn\u2019t take long before Phil was shutting the front door of his apartment behind him.</p><p><i><b>\u201cPretty nice place you got he-\u201d</b></i> Dan was cut off by Phil\u2019s on his. Phil pushed him up against the wall his back landing with a thud. Phil ran his tongue along his bottom lip asking for permission. Dan graciously allowed him and Phil licked inside his mouth. Their tongues fought for dominance but in the end, Dan ended up giving it to Phil, melting into his touch allowing Phil to ravish his mouth and neck.</p><p>Phil bit his neck and started sucking a fresh bruise and Dan lost it, moaning and grinding his hard-on into Phil\u2019s thigh.</p><p>Phil pulled away placing his hands on either side of the wall by Dan\u2019s head. <i><b>\u201cDo you wanna take this to the bedroom?\u201d</b></i> he asked his voice husky and a bit breathless.</p><p><i><b>\u201cDear god please yes,\u201d </b></i>Dan babbled.</p><p>Phil grinned as he pointed him in the direction to his bedroom, <i><b>\u201cGo through the living room and the bedroom is the first one on the left. I\u2019ll be there in a minute.\u201d</b></i></p><p>Dan shook his head to show he understood and took off in the direction Phil pointed.</p><p>Dan was quite shocked when he entered Phil\u2019s bedroom. They had talked for several hours earlier that evening so of course, Dan knew Phil likes Muse and anime, but it made it more real to see the actual evidence up on his walls. Not wasting any more time he laid down on the green and blue checkered bedspread and waited for Phil.</p><p>It only took a moment for Phil to come back smirking as saw Dan laying down on the bed.</p><p>Phil left his clothes on and got on the bed pushing Dan back and continued to kiss him like he had minutes before.</p><p>The lay like that for a while Phil on top pressing Dan into the mattress filthily and shamelessly making out. Dan groaned,<b><i> \u201cPhil more please,\u201d</i></b> he whined.</p><p>Dan felt Phil smirk against his neck and continued leaving spots. But he did take Dan\u2019s hand in his and Dan\u2019s non-beating heart fluttered in his chest. But before he realized what was going on, Phil had swiftly had his hand handcuffed to the bed.</p><p><i><b>\u201cHey what are you doing?\u201d</b></i> he whined pulling on the handcuff.</p><p><i><b>\u201cDon\u2019t worry love,\u201d</b></i> Phil smirked at him as he hooked his other hand to the other side of the bed.</p><p><i><b>\u201cHey no stop,\u201d</b></i> he pleaded tugging at the chains again. Dan had a fear of being chained up, not that Phil knew that, thus is why he was telling him to let him go.</p><p><i><b>\u201cPhil I said no! Now let me go!\u201d </b></i>he screamed getting angry.</p><p>Phil ignored him as he rummaged around in his bedside drawer.</p><p>Dan mentally cursed himself, he hadn\u2019t feed in a few days, otherwise breaking these handcuffs would have been no problem for him at all.</p><p><i><b>\u201cPhil! I-\u201d</b></i></p><p>Phil slapped him hard against the face. <i><b>\u201cShut up you monster!\u201d</b></i> Phil sneered at him.</p><p>Fear coursed through his body, <b><i>\u201cWhat- what do you mean?\u201d</i></b> he stuttered.</p><p><i><b>\u201cIt figures you wouldn\u2019t remember me.\u201d</b></i> Phil chuckled now, looking him in the eyes.</p><p>Dan looked at him with confusion.</p><p>Phil merely chuckled again, <b><i>\u201c One year ago, Redman avenue?\u201d</i></b></p><p>Recognition spread on Dan\u2019s face, no it couldn\u2019t be.</p><p><i><b>\u201cAhh I see you remember now,\u201d</b></i> he grinned proudly.</p><p><i><b>\u201cYou killed my friend!\u201d</b></i> Dan shouted.</p><p><b><i>\u201cIt was an accident at first, I mean I was just looking for someone to hook up with but what were the chances that I ran into one let alone two vampires? Only you managed to get away didn\u2019t you Dan,</i></b>\u201d he glared down at him.</p><p><i><b>\u201cWhy are you going this? Why kill PJ?\u201d</b></i> tears sprung from his eyes.</p><p><b><i>\u201cDan I\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t figured it out already. I\u2019m a hunter,\u201d</i></b> he grinned proudly again.</p><p>Dan had heard of hunters before but never had a run in with one until now. Among the vampires, it was thought hunters where just a scary story told to the younger ones to scare them into obeying the leader of the nest.</p><p><i><b>\u201cPlease, you don\u2019t have to do this!\u201d</b></i> Dan pleaded.</p><p>A silver glint caught his eyes Phil was holding a wooden stake with silver on it behind his back.</p><p><b><i>\u201cBut don\u2019t you see I have to Dan! It\u2019s my job, just like it was my fathers and grandfathers job.\u201d</i></b></p><p>So Phil comes from a family of hunters.</p><p><b><i>\u201cI&rsquo;ve been searching for you for over a year it was just a lucky coincidence that I ran into you tonight at the bar,\u201d</i></b> he explained. \u201c<b><i>You wouldn\u2019t believe my surprise when I spotted you at the bar, I recognized you instantly.\u201d</i></b></p><p><b><i>\u201cPhil please, I don\u2019t hurt anyone, I only feed enough to live. Please,\u201d</i></b> he whispered pleading again.</p><p><b><i>\u201cThat doesn&rsquo;t change the fact your a monster and abomination!</i></b>\u201d he shouted. \u201cI have to do this.\u201d</p><p>Before Dan had the chance to respond Phil plunged the wooden steak straight into his none beating heart.</p><p>It was over fast and Phil almost couldn\u2019t believe he had done it. He looked at the abomination below him, tears streaked his face. \u201cThose tears are fake. He was a monster, it had to be done,\u201d he repeated over and over to himself. He had been raised to do this and Dan wasn\u2019t the last vampire he was going to kill.</p>",

Dan\u2019s mouth watered with want, he\u2019d never smelt anything as pleasant before.</p><p>The man walked right up next to him and turned to the bartender ordering his drink.</p><p><i><b>\u201cI\u2019ll have a margarita please.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cSure thing mate,\u201d </b></i>the bartender responded as he set to work making the man\u2019s drink.</p><p>With the blonde women completely forgotten, Dan sat down next to him.</p><p><i><b>\u201cI\u2019ll have an old fashion,</b></i>\u201d he said, throwing a couple of bills at the man, <i><b>\u201cI\u2019ll buy his too,\u201d</b></i> he said pointing to the man next to him.</p><p><i><b>\u201cOh no you don\u2019t have to do that,\u201d</b></i> the raven-haired man turned to him.</p><p><i><b>\u201cHonestly it\u2019s no problem. I have more money then I know what to do with anyway,\u201d </b></i>if Dan could have blushed he would have at the ridiculousness of his comment.</p><p><i><b>\u201cWell if you insist.\u201d</b></i> The man shrugged his shoulders now turning to the drink the bartender just sat down in front of him.</p><p><i><b>\u201cI\u2019m Dan by the way,\u201d </b></i>Dan shyly said.</p><p><i><b>\u201cPhil,\u201d </b></i>the man grinned at him.</p><p>He and Phil sat at the bar for over two hours just talking, he\u2019d learned they had quite a lot in common, well that was other than Dan was a bloodthirsty vampire and Phil wasn\u2019t. Not that he indulged this information to Phil. Over the two hours, the continued to drink, Phil becoming drunker as the time went on and Dan would have been too if he wasn\u2019t an immortal creature.</p><p>Normally he wouldn\u2019t talk and get to know his victims before feeding, it went along with not wanting to feel anything for them but Phil was different. Dan found himself forgetting about the constant hunger that he usually always felt. In fact, Dan found himself not wanting to feed on Phil at all, but instead drag him back to his apartment and instead elect to crush Phil at Mario Kart, which Dan was thrilled to learn was one of Phil\u2019s favorite games.</p><p>Dan giggled at something Phil just said when out of the blue Phil leaned over and whispered, \u201cHow about we get out of here, go back to my place?\u201d</p><p>Dan knew he shouldn\u2019t agree but there was something magnetic about Phil that just wouldn\u2019t allow him to say no. He hastily nodded his head. Phil smiled cheekily and paid the bartender for the last drinks they had just had.</p><p>The cab ride to Phil\u2019s apartment was quiet but Dan knew both of them could feel the electricity in the air. Dan had never been nervous like this before, his hands shook and if his heart would have been beating he knows it would be rapidly pumping.</p><p>Phil paid the cab driver and took a hold of Dan\u2019s hand, pulling him out of the backseat.</p><p><i><b>\u201cSo yeah, here it is.</b></i>\u201d Phil nervously rocked on his feet pointing to the building.</p><p><b><i>\u201cSo\u2026 are you going to invite me up?\u201d </i></b>Dan asked him nervously.</p><p><i><b>\u201cOh yeah, of course, umm do you want to come up?\u201d</b></i></p><p>Grinning Dan shook his head yes. A relieved look broke out onto Phil\u2019s face, \u201c<i><b>Well come on then follow me.\u201d</b></i></p><p>It didn\u2019t take long before Phil was shutting the front door of his apartment behind him.</p><p><i><b>\u201cPretty nice place you got he-\u201d</b></i> Dan was cut off by Phil\u2019s on his. Phil pushed him up against the wall his back landing with a thud. Phil ran his tongue along his bottom lip asking for permission. Dan graciously allowed him and Phil licked inside his mouth. Their tongues fought for dominance but in the end, Dan ended up giving it to Phil, melting into his touch allowing Phil to ravish his mouth and neck.</p><p>Phil bit his neck and started sucking a fresh bruise and Dan lost it, moaning and grinding his hard-on into Phil\u2019s thigh.</p><p>Phil pulled away placing his hands on either side of the wall by Dan\u2019s head. <i><b>\u201cDo you wanna take this to the bedroom?\u201d</b></i> he asked his voice husky and a bit breathless.</p><p><i><b>\u201cDear god please yes,\u201d </b></i>Dan babbled.</p><p>Phil grinned as he pointed him in the direction to his bedroom, <i><b>\u201cGo through the living room and the bedroom is the first one on the left. I\u2019ll be there in a minute.\u201d</b></i></p><p>Dan shook his head to show he understood and took off in the direction Phil pointed.</p><p>Dan was quite shocked when he entered Phil\u2019s bedroom. They had talked for several hours earlier that evening so of course, Dan knew Phil likes Muse and anime, but it made it more real to see the actual evidence up on his walls. Not wasting any more time he laid down on the green and blue checkered bedspread and waited for Phil.</p><p>It only took a moment for Phil to come back smirking as saw Dan laying down on the bed.</p><p>Phil left his clothes on and got on the bed pushing Dan back and continued to kiss him like he had minutes before.</p><p>The lay like that for a while Phil on top pressing Dan into the mattress filthily and shamelessly making out. Dan groaned,<b><i> \u201cPhil more please,\u201d</i></b> he whined.</p><p>Dan felt Phil smirk against his neck and continued leaving spots. But he did take Dan\u2019s hand in his and Dan\u2019s non-beating heart fluttered in his chest. But before he realized what was going on, Phil had swiftly had his hand handcuffed to the bed.</p><p><i><b>\u201cHey what are you doing?\u201d</b></i> he whined pulling on the handcuff.</p><p><i><b>\u201cDon\u2019t worry love,\u201d</b></i> Phil smirked at him as he hooked his other hand to the other side of the bed.</p><p><i><b>\u201cHey no stop,\u201d</b></i> he pleaded tugging at the chains again. Dan had a fear of being chained up, not that Phil knew that, thus is why he was telling him to let him go.</p><p><i><b>\u201cPhil I said no! Now let me go!\u201d </b></i>he screamed getting angry.</p><p>Phil ignored him as he rummaged around in his bedside drawer.</p><p>Dan mentally cursed himself, he hadn\u2019t feed in a few days, otherwise breaking these handcuffs would have been no problem for him at all.</p><p><i><b>\u201cPhil! I-\u201d</b></i></p><p>Phil slapped him hard against the face. <i><b>\u201cShut up you monster!\u201d</b></i> Phil sneered at him.</p><p>Fear coursed through his body, <b><i>\u201cWhat- what do you mean?\u201d</i></b> he stuttered.</p><p><i><b>\u201cIt figures you wouldn\u2019t remember me.\u201d</b></i> Phil chuckled now, looking him in the eyes.</p><p>Dan looked at him with confusion.</p><p>Phil merely chuckled again, <b><i>\u201c One year ago, Redman avenue?\u201d</i></b></p><p>Recognition spread on Dan\u2019s face, no it couldn\u2019t be.</p><p><i><b>\u201cAhh I see you remember now,\u201d</b></i> he grinned proudly.</p><p><i><b>\u201cYou killed my friend!\u201d</b></i> Dan shouted.</p><p><b><i>\u201cIt was an accident at first, I mean I was just looking for someone to hook up with but what were the chances that I ran into one let alone two vampires? Only you managed to get away didn\u2019t you Dan,</i></b>\u201d he glared down at him.</p><p><i><b>\u201cWhy are you going this? Why kill PJ?\u201d</b></i> tears sprung from his eyes.</p><p><b><i>\u201cDan I\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t figured it out already. I\u2019m a hunter,\u201d</i></b> he grinned proudly again.</p><p>Dan had heard of hunters before but never had a run in with one until now. Among the vampires, it was thought hunters where just a scary story told to the younger ones to scare them into obeying the leader of the nest.</p><p><i><b>\u201cPlease, you don\u2019t have to do this!\u201d</b></i> Dan pleaded.</p><p>A silver glint caught his eyes Phil was holding a wooden stake with silver on it behind his back.</p><p><b><i>\u201cBut don\u2019t you see I have to Dan! It\u2019s my job, just like it was my fathers and grandfathers job.\u201d</i></b></p><p>So Phil comes from a family of hunters.</p><p><b><i>\u201cI\u2019ve been searching for you for over a year it was just a lucky coincidence that I ran into you tonight at the bar,\u201d</i></b> he explained. \u201c<b><i>You wouldn\u2019t believe my surprise when I spotted you at the bar, I recognized you instantly.\u201d</i></b></p><p><b><i>\u201cPhil please, I don\u2019t hurt anyone, I only feed enough to live. Please,\u201d</i></b> he whispered pleading again.</p><p><b><i>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t change the fact your a monster and abomination!</i></b>\u201d he shouted. \u201cI have to do this.\u201d</p><p>Before Dan had the chance to respond Phil plunged the wooden steak straight into his none beating heart.</p><p>It was over fast and Phil almost couldn\u2019t believe he had done it. He looked at the abomination below him, tears streaked his face. \u201cThose tears are fake. He was a monster, it had to be done,\u201d he repeated over and over to himself. He had been raised to do this and Dan wasn\u2019t the last vampire he was going to kill.</p>",

He watched the shivering patrons enter the bar and shrug off their heavy coats, ordering drinks and relishing in the fact that they weren\u2019t out in the cold anymore.</p><p>Any of this people would be easy prey for him. He\u2019s done this countless times before, seduce some poor soul whose drunk out of their mind and take them back to his place. He wasn\u2019t a monster, he never took advantage of anyone in their inebriated state and most of the time they passed out before anything could ever happen. And that is when he fed.</p><p>Over the years he had become accustomed to shutting off his emotions and getting what needs to be done, done. It was hard to feel anything when you needed to drain people of their blood to merely survive.</p><p>When he was younger - or when he was made - he had trouble stopping when drinking from his victims and it had gotten so bad that at one point he\u2019d lost count of how many people he\u2019d accidentally bleed dry. \u00a0</p><p>For the first part of his vampire life, he had run with a nest of vampires that massacred the humans they fed on. They had been much older than him and had given in to what they liked to call their \u201cnatural Instincts.\u201d They could care less about the innocent souls they took, and some of those taken were merely for the pleasure of it.</p><p>But that had ended one day when their nest had been invaded and they had been hunted down and slaughtered, just like the countless people they had slaughtered. As it turns out a small village nearby had realized what was going on when their people started going missing. They\u2019d waited until one really sunny afternoon and struck, taking no mercy on the creatures who\u2019d attacked their village. Luckily Dan preferred to sleep under the soil than \u201ccoffins\u201d so he was left on accident by the villagers who had no idea he was buried in the backyard. The attack on his nest had been enough to \u201csober\u201d him up enough to not turn his emotions completely off but enough that he didn\u2019t have to feel anything while he killed his victims.</p><p>It was only when he had met his best friend PJ that Dan finally allowed himself to start feeling again. And it was PJ who had taught him self-control and started teaching him that they were no better than the humans and that they all could live in harmony with each other.</p><p>Since becoming a vampire, his sense of time has become distorted. He doesn\u2019t know exactly how long he and PJ had been together but it had been long enough that they developed a strong friendship over the years.</p><p>About a year ago he and PJ had been out stalking the streets looking for dinner to push them over for a few days when they spotted a man wandering the streets. He was the only viable prey they had seen all nights so neither one of them had stopped to question why he might be such easy prey.</p><p>Dan had stood off to the side waiting for his turn to feed as PJ had been the one who had his sharp teeth sunk into the man\u2019s neck. Out of nowhere the man had pulled a wooden stake out of his coat pocket and struck PJ straight in the chest. Dan had watched in horror as his best friend and mentor tumbled to the ground. The man had trouble pulling the stake out of PJ\u2019s lifeless body which had given Dan just enough time to escape. Ever since that night, he was very careful about who he chose for prey, which is why he tended to hand out in bars and only taking home extremely wasted people.</p><p>Dan sat at a table in the back of the bar watching people drink and dirty dance and grind against each other. He had his eye on this one blonde woman all night. She had come into the bar alone and continued to sit there alone all night as she downed drink after drink.</p><p>It was nearing midnight and he figured he better make his move as the bar would soon be closing and he didn\u2019t want to take the chance of losing a feed tonight. With stealth, he made his way up to the bar and stood next to the women. He was getting ready to make his move when a sweet cinnamon smell overpowered his senses. Whipping his head around to look he noticed a man who looked to be in his early thirties with striking blue eyes and raven black hair, that was pushed up into a quiff onto his forehead. He wore a red plaid shirt that Dan could see under his coat and a pair of blue skinny jeans. Dan\u2019s mouth watered with want, he\u2019d never smelt anything as pleasant before.</p><p>The man walked right up next to him and turned to the bartender ordering his drink.</p><p><i><b>\u201cI\u2019ll have a margarita please.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cSure thing mate,\u201d </b></i>the bartender responded as he set to work making the man\u2019s drink.</p><p>With the blonde women completely forgotten, Dan sat down next to him.</p><p><i><b>\u201cI\u2019ll have an old fashion,</b></i>\u201d he said, throwing a couple of bills at the man, <i><b>\u201cI\u2019ll buy his too,\u201d</b></i> he said pointing to the man next to him.</p><p><i><b>\u201cOh no you don\u2019t have to do that,\u201d</b></i> the raven-haired man turned to him.</p><p><i><b>\u201cHonestly it\u2019s no problem. I have more money then I know what to do with anyway,\u201d </b></i>if Dan could have blushed he would have at the ridiculousness of his comment.</p><p><i><b>\u201cWell if you insist.\u201d</b></i> The man shrugged his shoulders now turning to the drink the bartender just sat down in front of him.</p><p><i><b>\u201cI\u2019m Dan by the way,\u201d </b></i>Dan shyly said.</p><p><i><b>\u201cPhil,\u201d </b></i>the man grinned at him.</p><p>He and Phil sat at the bar for over two hours just talking, he\u2019d learned they had quite a lot in common, well that was other than Dan was a bloodthirsty vampire and Phil wasn\u2019t.

He watched the shivering patrons enter the bar and shrug off their heavy coats, ordering drinks and relishing in the fact that they weren&rsquo;t out in the cold anymore.</p><p>Any of this people would be easy prey for him. He&rsquo;s done this countless times before, seduce some poor soul whose drunk out of their mind and take them back to his place. He wasn&rsquo;t a monster, he never took advantage of anyone in their inebriated state and most of the time they passed out before anything could ever happen. And that is when he fed.</p><p>Over the years he had become accustomed to shutting off his emotions and getting what needs to be done, done. It was hard to feel anything when you needed to drain people of their blood to merely survive.</p><p>When he was younger - or when he was made - he had trouble stopping when drinking from his victims and it had gotten so bad that at one point he&rsquo;d lost count of how many people he&rsquo;d accidentally bleed dry. &nbsp;</p><p>For the first part of his vampire life, he had run with a nest of vampires that massacred the humans they fed on. They had been much older than him and had given in to what they liked to call their &ldquo;natural Instincts.&rdquo; They could care less about the innocent souls they took, and some of those taken were merely for the pleasure of it.</p><p>But that had ended one day when their nest had been invaded and they had been hunted down and slaughtered, just like the countless people they had slaughtered. As it turns out a small village nearby had realized what was going on when their people started going missing. They&rsquo;d waited until one really sunny afternoon and struck, taking no mercy on the creatures who&rsquo;d attacked their village. Luckily Dan preferred to sleep under the soil than &ldquo;coffins&rdquo; so he was left on accident by the villagers who had no idea he was buried in the backyard. The attack on his nest had been enough to &ldquo;sober&rdquo; him up enough to not turn his emotions completely off but enough that he didn&rsquo;t have to feel anything while he killed his victims.</p><p>It was only when he had met his best friend PJ that Dan finally allowed himself to start feeling again. And it was PJ who had taught him self-control and started teaching him that they were no better than the humans and that they all could live in harmony with each other.</p><p>Since becoming a vampire, his sense of time has become distorted. He doesn&rsquo;t know exactly how long he and PJ had been together but it had been long enough that they developed a strong friendship over the years.</p><p>About a year ago he and PJ had been out stalking the streets looking for dinner to push them over for a few days when they spotted a man wandering the streets. He was the only viable prey they had seen all nights so neither one of them had stopped to question why he might be such easy prey.</p><p>Dan had stood off to the side waiting for his turn to feed as PJ had been the one who had his sharp teeth sunk into the man&rsquo;s neck. Out of nowhere the man had pulled a wooden stake out of his coat pocket and struck PJ straight in the chest. Dan had watched in horror as his best friend and mentor tumbled to the ground. The man had trouble pulling the stake out of PJ&rsquo;s lifeless body which had given Dan just enough time to escape. Ever since that night, he was very careful about who he chose for prey, which is why he tended to hand out in bars and only taking home extremely wasted people.</p><p>Dan sat at a table in the back of the bar watching people drink and dirty dance and grind against each other. He had his eye on this one blonde woman all night. She had come into the bar alone and continued to sit there alone all night as she downed drink after drink.</p><p>It was nearing midnight and he figured he better make his move as the bar would soon be closing and he didn&rsquo;t want to take the chance of losing a feed tonight. With stealth, he made his way up to the bar and stood next to the women. He was getting ready to make his move when a sweet cinnamon smell overpowered his senses. Whipping his head around to look he noticed a man who looked to be in his early thirties with striking blue eyes and raven black hair, that was pushed up into a quiff onto his forehead. He wore a red plaid shirt that Dan could see under his coat and a pair of blue skinny jeans. Dan&rsquo;s mouth watered with want, he&rsquo;d never smelt anything as pleasant before.</p><p>The man walked right up next to him and turned to the bartender ordering his drink.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a margarita please.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Sure thing mate,&rdquo; </b></i>the bartender responded as he set to work making the man&rsquo;s drink.</p><p>With the blonde women completely forgotten, Dan sat down next to him.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have an old fashion,</b></i>&rdquo; he said, throwing a couple of bills at the man, <i><b>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll buy his too,&rdquo;</b></i> he said pointing to the man next to him.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Oh no you don&rsquo;t have to do that,&rdquo;</b></i> the raven-haired man turned to him.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Honestly it&rsquo;s no problem. I have more money then I know what to do with anyway,&rdquo; </b></i>if Dan could have blushed he would have at the ridiculousness of his comment.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Well if you insist.&rdquo;</b></i> The man shrugged his shoulders now turning to the drink the bartender just sat down in front of him.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Dan by the way,&rdquo; </b></i>Dan shyly said.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Phil,&rdquo; </b></i>the man grinned at him.</p><p>He and Phil sat at the bar for over two hours just talking, he&rsquo;d learned they had quite a lot in common, well that was other than Dan was a bloodthirsty vampire and Phil wasn&rsquo;t. Not that he indulged this information to Phil. Over the two hours, the continued to drink, Phil becoming drunker as the time went on and Dan would have been too if he wasn&rsquo;t an immortal creature.</p><p>Normally he wouldn&rsquo;t talk and get to know his victims before feeding, it went along with not wanting to feel anything for them but Phil was different. Dan found himself forgetting about the constant hunger that he usually always felt. In fact, Dan found himself not wanting to feed on Phil at all, but instead drag him back to his apartment and instead elect to crush Phil at Mario Kart, which Dan was thrilled to learn was one of Phil&rsquo;s favorite games.</p><p>Dan giggled at something Phil just said when out of the blue Phil leaned over and whispered, &ldquo;How about we get out of here, go back to my place?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan knew he shouldn&rsquo;t agree but there was something magnetic about Phil that just wouldn&rsquo;t allow him to say no. He hastily nodded his head. Phil smiled cheekily and paid the bartender for the last drinks they had just had.</p><p>The cab ride to Phil&rsquo;s apartment was quiet but Dan knew both of them could feel the electricity in the air. Dan had never been nervous like this before, his hands shook and if his heart would have been beating he knows it would be rapidly pumping.</p><p>Phil paid the cab driver and took a hold of Dan&rsquo;s hand, pulling him out of the backseat.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;So yeah, here it is.</b></i>&rdquo; Phil nervously rocked on his feet pointing to the building.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;So&hellip; are you going to invite me up?&rdquo; </i></b>Dan asked him nervously.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Oh yeah, of course, umm do you want to come up?&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>Grinning Dan shook his head yes. A relieved look broke out onto Phil&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;<i><b>Well come on then follow me.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>It didn&rsquo;t take long before Phil was shutting the front door of his apartment behind him.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Pretty nice place you got he-&rdquo;</b></i> Dan was cut off by Phil&rsquo;s on his. Phil pushed him up against the wall his back landing with a thud. Phil ran his tongue along his bottom lip asking for permission. Dan graciously allowed him and Phil licked inside his mouth. Their tongues fought for dominance but in the end, Dan ended up giving it to Phil, melting into his touch allowing Phil to ravish his mouth and neck.</p><p>Phil bit his neck and started sucking a fresh bruise and Dan lost it, moaning and grinding his hard-on into Phil&rsquo;s thigh.</p><p>Phil pulled away placing his hands on either side of the wall by Dan&rsquo;s head. <i><b>&ldquo;Do you wanna take this to the bedroom?&rdquo;</b></i> he asked his voice husky and a bit breathless.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Dear god please yes,&rdquo; </b></i>Dan babbled.</p><p>Phil grinned as he pointed him in the direction to his bedroom, <i><b>&ldquo;Go through the living room and the bedroom is the first one on the left. I&rsquo;ll be there in a minute.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>Dan shook his head to show he understood and took off in the direction Phil pointed.</p><p>Dan was quite shocked when he entered Phil&rsquo;s bedroom. They had talked for several hours earlier that evening so of course, Dan knew Phil likes Muse and anime, but it made it more real to see the actual evidence up on his walls. Not wasting any more time he laid down on the green and blue checkered bedspread and waited for Phil.</p><p>It only took a moment for Phil to come back smirking as saw Dan laying down on the bed.</p><p>Phil left his clothes on and got on the bed pushing Dan back and continued to kiss him like he had minutes before.</p><p>The lay like that for a while Phil on top pressing Dan into the mattress filthily and shamelessly making out. Dan groaned,<b><i> &ldquo;Phil more please,&rdquo;</i></b> he whined.</p><p>Dan felt Phil smirk against his neck and continued leaving spots. But he did take Dan&rsquo;s hand in his and Dan&rsquo;s non-beating heart fluttered in his chest. But before he realized what was going on, Phil had swiftly had his hand handcuffed to the bed.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Hey what are you doing?&rdquo;</b></i> he whined pulling on the handcuff.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry love,&rdquo;</b></i> Phil smirked at him as he hooked his other hand to the other side of the bed.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Hey no stop,&rdquo;</b></i> he pleaded tugging at the chains again. Dan had a fear of being chained up, not that Phil knew that, thus is why he was telling him to let him go.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Phil I said no! Now let me go!&rdquo; </b></i>he screamed getting angry.</p><p>Phil ignored him as he rummaged around in his bedside drawer.</p><p>Dan mentally cursed himself, he hadn&rsquo;t feed in a few days, otherwise breaking these handcuffs would have been no problem for him at all.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Phil! I-&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>Phil slapped him hard against the face. <i><b>&ldquo;Shut up you monster!&rdquo;</b></i> Phil sneered at him.</p><p>Fear coursed through his body, <b><i>&ldquo;What- what do you mean?&rdquo;</i></b> he stuttered.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;It figures you wouldn&rsquo;t remember me.&rdquo;</b></i> Phil chuckled now, looking him in the eyes.</p><p>Dan looked at him with confusion.</p><p>Phil merely chuckled again, <b><i>&ldquo; One year ago, Redman avenue?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>Recognition spread on Dan&rsquo;s face, no it couldn&rsquo;t be.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Ahh I see you remember now,&rdquo;</b></i> he grinned proudly.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;You killed my friend!&rdquo;</b></i> Dan shouted.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;It was an accident at first, I mean I was just looking for someone to hook up with but what were the chances that I ran into one let alone two vampires?

And it won\u2019t be much of a video without you,\u201d</b></i> he reminded him.</p><p>Dan rolled his eyes, <i><b>\u201cFiiine I\u2019ll go, we\u2019ll do it.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cYes!\u201d</b></i> Phil grinned pumping his fist in the air in victory.</p><p>Turning to Phil, <i><b>\u201cWhat time do we have to meet them there again?\u201d</b></i></p><p>Phil glanced down at his phone, <i><b>\u201dShit we probably should have left already.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cReally Phil?</b></i>\u201d he exclaimed as he frantically tried shoving his shoes on his feet.</p><p><b><i>\u201cWell if somebody hadn\u2019t of waited to the last minute to decide they were going it wouldn\u2019t have been a probl-.\u201d</i></b></p><p>Dan turned around and glared at him.</p><p>Not wanting to fight, Phil held his hands up in the air in defeat.</p><p>The house planned to \u201cghost hunt\u201d was a fairly known place. For years there had been rumors of the awful things that had happened there. One of the main stories was that there was a family living there in the 60\u2019s and one night the father had murdered the entire family including the family dog. The other main story people liked to tell about this place was that back in the 1900\u2019s the place used to be a small mental hospital where the doctors performed unspeakable experiments and acts of torture on the patients that had resulted in several deaths. Of course, no one knew if either of these stories were true or not but that hasn&rsquo;t stopped people from sneaking into the house over the years trying to see if the ghosts were real.</p><p>And since the house was out in the middle of nowhere they had to rent a car instead of taking a cab. Because when Phil had called to set this all up the cab company outright refused to take them since it was so far out of town.</p><p>They have never been known for their punctuality but this was ridiculous, Dan thought as they drove in silence. They had promised a video with PJ and Sophie to the fans and he hoped they hadn\u2019t left or started without them. \u00a0</p><p>Dan fidgeted in the passenger&rsquo;s seat of the rented car, too nervous to sit still. <i><b>\u201cWho\u2019s idea was it to film a video in an abandoned haunted house again?\u201d</b></i></p><p>Phil glanced at him out of the corner of his eye,<i><b> \u201dHey you ok?\u201d </b></i>Dan nodded his head. <i><b>\u201cAre you sure? We don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d</b></i> Concern showed on his face. <i><b>\u201cThe fans will understand.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine. Besides, they\u2019ll never let us live this down if we don\u2019t do it,\u201d</b></i> he chuckled, giving Phil a shaky smile. Phil reached over and placed one of his hands on Dan\u2019s leg. Dan let out a little sigh of relief just feeling Phil\u2019s hand made him feel safe and comforted. \u00a0</p><p>They pulled up to the big iron gates that sat a few hundred feet from the house. When Phil had talked to the owner of the property they had told him that they would have to walk up to the house from there. He had explained if he left the gate open it tended to draw in people who just wanted to come in and squat in it or vandalize the house.</p><p>Seeing PJ\u2019s car still there made Phil sigh in relief knowing they were still there he just hoped they hadn\u2019t started without them. Phil took ahold of Dan\u2019s hand and they started walking up the dark winding path that leads up the house. The path was small and overrun with bushes and shrubs making it almost impossible to see. \u00a0</p><p>The house came into view as they rounded a tree Dan\u2019s heart dropped in his chest. Why had he agreed to this? What idiots went to an abandoned house in the middle of nowhere on Halloween night of all nights. Plus it was a fucking full moon to boot.</p><p>Phil took out his iPhone and started to record himself.</p><p><b><i>\u201cHey, guys! So after a long drive, we are finally here! Who\u2019s excited to see some spooky things?\u201d </i></b>He then turned the phone to record the exterior of the house. The house was huge, dingy, and the grey paint flaked on the outside, the window panes were smeared with age and dirt and its brickwork was crumbling away. And like the path leading to the house, the path going up to the door was also overgrown with bushes and brambles.</p><p><b><i>\u201cSo Dan are you ready to see some ghosts?\u201d </i></b>Phil joked as he panned the camera over to him. He couldn\u2019t see his own face at the moment but if he had to guess he probably looked terrified. He tried as hard as he could to plaster on his video persona, <b><i>\u201cSo yeah here we are. Uhh, so we&rsquo;re going to try and catch something spooky and fun for you guys.\u201d</i></b> He rubbed the back of his neck, <i><b>\u201cSo yeah here we go, and I guess if this video never gets put up then that means we died,\u201d</b></i> he chuckled, being slightly serious about the dying part.</p><p>Phil turned the phone back to himself and said a few more things about the history and the supposed stories of the house before he hit the stop record button.</p><p>Seeing he wasn\u2019t recording anymore Dan grabbed Phil\u2019s hand <i><b>\u201cPhil I don\u2019t know about this,\u201d</b></i> he said, expressing his uncertainty.</p><p>Phil chuckled<b><i>,\u201d Come on it isn\u2019t so bad.\u201d</i></b> Dan looked back at the house. Yep, still as bad as it had been a minute ago.</p><p><i><b>\u201cOh look there\u2019s PJ and Sophie.\u201d</b></i> He waved over to their friends who had just walked from around the house.</p><p><i><b>\u201cWe thought we heard talking.\u201d</b></i> Sophie smiled brightly at them.</p><p><i><b>\u201cYeah, we just got here,\u201d</b></i> Phil said as he pulled Dan\u2019s shivering body closer to him.</p><p>\u201c<b><i>Hey, guys we weren&rsquo;t sure if you were coming or not.\u201d</i></b> Their friend\u2019s jogged over to them.</p><p>\u201c<i><b>Sorry uh, we lost track of time,\u201d </b></i>Phil explained.</p><p>Dan squeezed Phil\u2019s hand letting him know that he was grateful he hadn\u2019t mentioned how he had been scared.</p><p><b><i>\u201cWe were just recording the back of the place anyway, we didn\u2019t want to start without you guys,\u201d</i></b> PJ said pulling his camera out of his bag.</p><p>Turning it on he pointed it and him and Phil, <i><b>\u201cLook how it is guys! Dan and Phil have offered to come on this crazy adventure with us! So are you guys ready?\u201d</b></i> PJ grinned despite the camera not being able to see it.</p><p>Phil smiled, <b><i>\u201dYou ready?\u201d </i></b>he asked, turning to Dan.</p><p>Trying his best to sound neutral,<i><b>\u201d Umm yep. Let\u2019s go find some ghostussy,\u201d</b></i> he nervously jokes.</p><p>Everyone chuckled at his joke, Phil made some joke to the camera in PJ\u2019s hand about Dan needing to be stopped.</p><p>Pulling his iPhone back out, Phil started to record as they made their way up the front steps of the house. Up to the rotting door that separated them from what laid inside the house. They all took a deep breath before Phil using the hand not holding his phone to pushed the heavy door open. The door creaked as it slowly swung open. That would be a great shot for the video Dan thought. Phil was the first one to go inside dragging Dan along with him. PJ and Sophie stumbled in after them.</p><p>Phil and PJ panned their cameras around to catch everyone\u2019s initial reaction to everything.</p><p>A cool shudder trickled down his spine. He glanced around nervously. Cold, hesitant light streamed in through a cracked window, casting eerie shadows on the walls. What was left of the abandon furniture was covered in sheets that had once been white but are now brown with years of dust and grime that had settled on them.</p><p><i><b>\u201cThis is so cool,\u201d </b></i>PJ whispered to his camera.</p><p>Phil nodded his head in agreement, <b><i>\u201dOh look at those portraits on the wall. The people almost look like their looking right through you!</i></b>\u201d he took his iPhone and zoomed in on a creepy looking painting of a man in a suit and top hat.</p><p>Dan shivered again, <i><b>\u201cWhat\u2019s that smell?\u201d</b></i> he asked in a small voice. It smelt like a combination of rotting wood and cigarette smoke.</p><p>His question went unanswered as Phil, PJ, and Sophie started exploring the first few rooms of the house. Pulling out his own iPhone to get his own footage he walked into what he assumed was as the dining room. In the middle of the room, there was a huge wooden table with a layer of dust covering it. He heard a rattle and looked up as a broken chandelier swayed in the draft. Trying to keep his wits, he showed the audience the swaying chandelier,<i><b> \u201cLooks like the ghost and ghouls are already performing for you guys.\u201d </b></i>Chuckling, he turned his attention to a small chest in the corner of the room, but just as he was about to open it and film what was inside he heard a scream.</p><p><i><b>\u201cShit!\u201d </b></i>Phil screamed from the adjoining room.</p><p>Shoving his phone in his pocket he sprinted through the walkway between the rooms, <i><b>\u201cPhil what\u2019s wrong are you alright?\u201d</b></i></p><p>Phil was clutching his chest breathing heavily, <i><b>\u201cYeah I just thought I saw something move in the corner over there.\u201d</b></i> He pointed his phone towards a corner of the room, \u201c<i><b>Turns out the house isn\u2019t as abandoned as we thought, there\u2019s a family of rats living here,</b></i>\u201d he breathed out chuckling nervously.</p><p>Just then PJ and Sophie came running in the room, \u201c<b><i>What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</i></b></p><p>They quickly explained what had happened, Phil now chuckling at how much he had freaked out. But they ultimately decided that it would probably be best if they stayed together just because if something else did happen they didn\u2019t want to scare someone else who might be on the other side of the house.</p><p>Once again both PJ and Phil pulled out their devices, recording as they walked through to the kitchen. Which was located in the back of the house.</p><p>Phil was showing the camera something on the counter when Dan stopped dead in his tracks, <i>\u201dDid you hear that?\u201d</i> he whispered.</p><p><i><b>\u201cWhat?\u201d</b></i> they all looked at him questioning.</p><p><b><i>\u201cI swear I heard footsteps above us,\u201d</i></b> he pointed towards the ceiling.</p><p><i><b>\u201cCome on Dan you&rsquo;re not being funny,\u201d</b></i> Sophie hissed, <b><i>\u201cStop messing around.\u201d</i></b></p><p><b><i>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to be, I know what I heard,\u201d</i></b> he defended himself.</p><p>\u201c<i><b>I\u2019m sure it was nothing,\u201d</b></i> Phil said, walking up and giving him a reassuring squeeze on the shoulder.</p><p>Dan glared at them, <i><b>\u201dI know I heard something!\u201d</b></i> he insisted</p><p>PJ turned his camera on himself, \u201cWell guys Dan thinks he heard something upstairs I say we should go investigate don\u2019t you think?\u201d he said giving a cheeky grin to the audience. \u00a0</p><p><i><b>\u201cYeah let\u2019s go!\u201d</b></i> Sophie chimed in clearly excited.</p><p>Phil turned to him, <b><i>\u201cwhat do you think?\u201d</i></b></p><p>He took a hold of Phil\u2019s hand knowing it would have to be edited out later. <b><i>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d</i></b> he said, trying to sound brave.</p><p>Phil chuckled and turned the camera back on himself, <i><b>\u201cIt\u2019s settled lads we\u2019re going upstairs to investigate!\u201d</b></i></p><p>They explored the upstairs without hearing anything else. They had decided it would be alright if they split up as long as they stayed in pairs so he and Phil were currently in one of the bedrooms. While PJ and Sophie went to investigate another room on the floor.</p><p>The bedroom was just like the rest of the house: everything in it was coated in a layer of dust.</p><p><i><b>\u201cDan come over here!\u201d</b></i> he heard Phil say from across the room.</p><p>He walked over to see what Phil was looking at. He rolled his eyes at what Phil had written. His iconic signature with a smiley face as well as, \u201d<i><b>Phan forever\u201d </b></i>right next to it.</p><p><b><i>\u201cDefacing property now Lester. What would the fans think of innocent Phil now?\u201d </i></b>he giggled.</p><p>\u201c<i><b>Hey it\u2019s not permanent so it doesn&rsquo;t count!\u201d</b></i></p><p>Dan giggled again as he leaned in and gave Phil a soft kiss on the lips.</p><p><i><b>\u201cDannnn that\u2019s just more editing,\u201d</b></i> Phil whined.</p><p><b><i>\u201cAnd isn\u2019t it just a coincidence you said you would do all the editing on this video Lester,\u201d</i></b> he grinned.</p><p>Phil huffed and accepted the second kiss Dan planted on his mouth.</p><p>A shiver curled through the hairs on the back of Dan\u2019s neck.</p><p><i><b>\u201cHey, you alright?\u201d </b></i>Phil asked.</p><p><i><b>\u201cI don\u2019t know I just got a funny feeling all of a sudden.\u201d</b></i></p><p>Phil looked at him concerned.</p><p><b><i>\u201cIs it me or did it get really fucking cold in here?\u201d </i></b>he shivered violently. \u00a0</p><p>Phil started shrugging his jacket off. \u201c<b><i>Here you can have my jack-.\u201d</i></b></p><p>When a loud crash interrupted him. Both of them jumped and screamed.</p><p>\u201c<i><b>What the fuck was that?\u201d</b></i> Dan asked as his heart ran a marathon inside his chest.</p><p>In his shaken state, Phil managed to answer<b><i>, \u201cLooks like the wind blew the door shut.\u201d</i></b></p><p><b><i>\u201cPhil are you really trying to me that was the fucking wind?!\u201d</i></b></p><p><b><i>\u201cWhat else could it hav-\u201d</i></b></p><p>Phil\u2019s face went white as he hissed in pain.</p><p><i><b>\u201cJesus Christ what happened?\u201d</b></i> Dan questioned him.</p><p><b><i>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I had a sudden pain in my back like something had burned me!\u201d </i></b>he screamed.</p><p>Phil finished taken his jacket off and lift his shirt up trying to see his own back. Finally admitting defeat he turned his back to Dan, <b><i>\u201cDo you see anything?\u201d</i></b></p><p>Dan felt all the remaining blood drain from his face.</p><p><i><b>\u201cWell do you see anything?\u201d </b></i>Phil huffed.</p><p><b><i>\u201cYou have three scratches on your back,\u201d</i></b> he whispered.</p><p><i><b>\u201cWhat was that,\u201d </b></i>he now turned around to face him.</p><p>\u201c<i><b>I said you have three long scratches going across your back,\u201d</b></i> he said a little bit louder.</p><p><b><i>\u201cWhat? This isn\u2019t the time to be pulling jokes, Dan,</i>\u201d</b> Phil scolded him.</p><p>Offended that Phil would think he was kidding he put his hands on the scratches, <i><b>\u201cYou think I would lie about that.\u201d </b></i>he asked pressing just enough into scratches that he could feel them.</p><p>Phil hissed, <i><b>\u201dJesus Christ!\u201d</b></i> he yelled.</p><p><i><b>\u201cI told you,\u201d</b></i> Dan said flatly.</p><p><i><b>\u201cI think we should probably find the others and leave,\u201d</b></i> Phil said after a moment.</p><p>Dan just nodded his head in agreement.</p><p>As they were exiting the bedroom there was a loud crash behind them. Spinning around to see the window that certainly wasn\u2019t broken a minute ago was no broken with shards of glass all over the floor.</p><p>Without a second thought, they turned back around and stumbled out of the room,<i><b> \u201cPJ! SOPHIE!\u201d</b></i> Phil yelled. There was no answer as they ran down the hallway to the other bedroom. They throw open every door on the floor and still couldn\u2019t find either of their friends.</p><p><i><b>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back I think we forgot that room at the end of the hall,\u201d </b></i>Phil said pointing to the room.</p><p>Dan didn\u2019t want to stay there by himself but it felt like he was wearing concrete shoes his feet wouldn\u2019t listen to his brain. \u00a0</p><p>Once again Dan felt the temperature drop and out of the corner of his eye he saw a dark shadowy figure dart behind a door right next to him.</p><p>He screamed at the top of his lungs and fell to the floor sobbing. Phil came rushing back down the hallway,<b><i>\u201d Dan! Dan! Are you ok?\u201d</i></b></p><p>He sobbed and shook his head. Phil enveloped him in a hug. \u201c<b><i>Shh, Shh it\u2019s alright.\u201d</i></b> He tried soothing him by rubbing circles on his back.</p><p>Eventually, his sobs turned to whimpers, <b><i>\u201cPhil can we please go home now?\u201d </i></b>he pleaded.</p><p><i><b>\u201cOf course, come on.\u201d</b></i> He helped Dan to his feet and wrapped his arm around his waist. With Phil\u2019s help, they made their way down the creaky old staircase.</p><p>Once they made it safely back outside Dan buried his head in Phil\u2019s chest. His salty tears now drying on Phil\u2019s shirt.</p><p><b><i>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry Dan, it was my idea to do this,\u201d</i></b> he said guilt in his voice.</p><p>He snuggled himself closer to Phil, <i><b>\u201dIt\u2019s alright Philly. Besides, I agreed that it would be an excellent video, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cYeah, but you tried backing out at the last minute and I made you come.\u201d</b></i></p><p>Dan cupped Phils face with his hand, \u201c<b><i>You didn\u2019t make me do anything. Now come on let\u2019s go.\u201d</i></b></p><p>\u201c<i><b>Ok. Yeah, let\u2019s see if PJ and Sophie went back to the cars.\u201d</b></i></p><p>Dan shivered as they started making their way back down the winding path. <i><b>\u201cHere take this.</b></i>\u201d Phil said as he draped his jacket that he was carrying over Dan\u2019s shoulders.\u201d</p><p><i><b>\u201cThanks,\u201d</b></i> he said burying his nose into it and taking a whiff of comfort and Phil.</p><p>They could see before they reached the cars that both their friends had obviously abandoned them earlier as they were huddled together sitting on the hood of Phil&rsquo;s rental car.</p><p><i><b>\u201cWhere did you guys go? We looked all over for you,</b></i>\u201d Phil yelled angrily.</p><p>Shocked, PJ tried defending himself, \u201c<b><i>Sorry, Soph thought she saw something and got scared. We couldn\u2019t find you guys so we figured you had come out to the car without telling us.\u201d</i></b></p><p><i><b>\u201cThat\u2019s no ex-\u201d</b></i></p><p>He was cut off by Sophie, <b><i>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. It happened so fast and all I could think about was getting out of there,\u201d </i></b>she admitted. \u201c<i><b>Oh god Dan did something happen? You look shaken.\u201d</b></i> She wrapped her arms around him bringing him in for a hug. He stayed limp as she hugged him.</p><p>Phil grunted as he took hold of Dan\u2019s arm, <i><b>\u201cListen I\u2019m sorry guys we can go over footage and stuff later. We\u2019re both pretty shaken up and need to get home.\u201d</b></i></p><p>They said goodbye to each other with the promise that sometime over the next few days they would get together and go over and footage that they had.</p><p>The ride home was as silent has it had been on the way there. Neither of them said anything until they were safely back in their apartment.</p><p><i><b>\u201cListen, Dan, I feel so bad,\u201d </b></i>Phil said rubbing the back of his neck.</p><p>He was a little more calmed down then he was before so he leaned in and placed a chaste kiss on Phil\u2019s lips. Pulling back. <i><b>\u201cPhil I already told you it\u2019s not your fault. That place was just creepy as hell,\u201d</b></i> he tried to smile. <i><b>\u201cI can\u2019t explain anything that happened tonight, but I do know that none of it\u2019s your fault.</b></i></p><p>Phil still didn\u2019t look convinced but after a few minutes he spoke, <b><i>\u201cDo you want me to make some hot chocolate and maybe we could snuggle on the couch and watch a disney movie?\u201d </i></b>he asked hopefully.</p><p>He smiled, <i><b>\u201cOf course. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</b></i></p><p>A smile appeared on Phil\u2019s face. He took Dan\u2019s hand and lead the way up the kitchen to get their drinks.</p><p><i><b>\u201cRemember you&rsquo;re still the one editing the footage,\u201d </b></i>Dan teased him.</p><p>Phil chuckled. Some weird things happened tonight but it would most certainly make for a great video.</p>",

And it won\u2019t be much of a video without you,\u201d</b></i> he reminded him.</p><p>Dan rolled his eyes, <i><b>\u201cFiiine I\u2019ll go, we\u2019ll do it.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cYes!\u201d</b></i> Phil grinned pumping his fist in the air in victory.</p><p>Turning to Phil, <i><b>\u201cWhat time do we have to meet them there again?\u201d</b></i></p><p>Phil glanced down at his phone, <i><b>\u201dShit we probably should have left already.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cReally Phil?</b></i>\u201d he exclaimed as he frantically tried shoving his shoes on his feet.</p><p><b><i>\u201cWell if somebody hadn\u2019t of waited to the last minute to decide they were going it wouldn\u2019t have been a probl-.\u201d</i></b></p><p>Dan turned around and glared at him.</p><p>Not wanting to fight, Phil held his hands up in the air in defeat.</p><p>The house planned to \u201cghost hunt\u201d was a fairly known place. For years there had been rumors of the awful things that had happened there. One of the main stories was that there was a family living there in the 60\u2019s and one night the father had murdered the entire family including the family dog. The other main story people liked to tell about this place was that back in the 1900\u2019s the place used to be a small mental hospital where the doctors performed unspeakable experiments and acts of torture on the patients that had resulted in several deaths. Of course, no one knew if either of these stories were true or not but that hasn\u2019t stopped people from sneaking into the house over the years trying to see if the ghosts were real.</p><p>And since the house was out in the middle of nowhere they had to rent a car instead of taking a cab. Because when Phil had called to set this all up the cab company outright refused to take them since it was so far out of town.</p><p>They have never been known for their punctuality but this was ridiculous, Dan thought as they drove in silence. They had promised a video with PJ and Sophie to the fans and he hoped they hadn\u2019t left or started without them. \u00a0</p><p>Dan fidgeted in the passenger\u2019s seat of the rented car, too nervous to sit still. <i><b>\u201cWho\u2019s idea was it to film a video in an abandoned haunted house again?\u201d</b></i></p><p>Phil glanced at him out of the corner of his eye,<i><b> \u201dHey you ok?\u201d </b></i>Dan nodded his head. <i><b>\u201cAre you sure? We don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d</b></i> Concern showed on his face. <i><b>\u201cThe fans will understand.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine. Besides, they\u2019ll never let us live this down if we don\u2019t do it,\u201d</b></i> he chuckled, giving Phil a shaky smile. Phil reached over and placed one of his hands on Dan\u2019s leg. Dan let out a little sigh of relief just feeling Phil\u2019s hand made him feel safe and comforted. \u00a0</p><p>They pulled up to the big iron gates that sat a few hundred feet from the house. When Phil had talked to the owner of the property they had told him that they would have to walk up to the house from there. He had explained if he left the gate open it tended to draw in people who just wanted to come in and squat in it or vandalize the house.</p><p>Seeing PJ\u2019s car still there made Phil sigh in relief knowing they were still there he just hoped they hadn\u2019t started without them. Phil took ahold of Dan\u2019s hand and they started walking up the dark winding path that leads up the house. The path was small and overrun with bushes and shrubs making it almost impossible to see. \u00a0</p><p>The house came into view as they rounded a tree Dan\u2019s heart dropped in his chest. Why had he agreed to this? What idiots went to an abandoned house in the middle of nowhere on Halloween night of all nights. Plus it was a fucking full moon to boot.</p><p>Phil took out his iPhone and started to record himself.</p><p><b><i>\u201cHey, guys! So after a long drive, we are finally here! Who\u2019s excited to see some spooky things?\u201d </i></b>He then turned the phone to record the exterior of the house. The house was huge, dingy, and the grey paint flaked on the outside, the window panes were smeared with age and dirt and its brickwork was crumbling away. And like the path leading to the house, the path going up to the door was also overgrown with bushes and brambles.</p><p><b><i>\u201cSo Dan are you ready to see some ghosts?\u201d </i></b>Phil joked as he panned the camera over to him. He couldn\u2019t see his own face at the moment but if he had to guess he probably looked terrified. He tried as hard as he could to plaster on his video persona, <b><i>\u201cSo yeah here we are. Uhh, so we\u2019re going to try and catch something spooky and fun for you guys.\u201d</i></b> He rubbed the back of his neck, <i><b>\u201cSo yeah here we go, and I guess if this video never gets put up then that means we died,\u201d</b></i> he chuckled, being slightly serious about the dying part.</p><p>Phil turned the phone back to himself and said a few more things about the history and the supposed stories of the house before he hit the stop record button.</p><p>Seeing he wasn\u2019t recording anymore Dan grabbed Phil\u2019s hand <i><b>\u201cPhil I don\u2019t know about this,\u201d</b></i> he said, expressing his uncertainty.</p><p>Phil chuckled<b><i>,\u201d Come on it isn\u2019t so bad.\u201d</i></b> Dan looked back at the house. Yep, still as bad as it had been a minute ago.</p><p><i><b>\u201cOh look there\u2019s PJ and Sophie.\u201d</b></i> He waved over to their friends who had just walked from around the house.</p><p><i><b>\u201cWe thought we heard talking.\u201d</b></i> Sophie smiled brightly at them.</p><p><i><b>\u201cYeah, we just got here,\u201d</b></i> Phil said as he pulled Dan\u2019s shivering body closer to him.</p><p>\u201c<b><i>Hey, guys we weren\u2019t sure if you were coming or not.\u201d</i></b> Their friend\u2019s jogged over to them.</p><p>\u201c<i><b>Sorry uh, we lost track of time,\u201d </b></i>Phil explained.</p><p>Dan squeezed Phil\u2019s hand letting him know that he was grateful he hadn\u2019t mentioned how he had been scared.</p><p><b><i>\u201cWe were just recording the back of the place anyway, we didn\u2019t want to start without you guys,\u201d</i></b> PJ said pulling his camera out of his bag.</p><p>Turning it on he pointed it and him and Phil, <i><b>\u201cLook how it is guys! Dan and Phil have offered to come on this crazy adventure with us! So are you guys ready?\u201d</b></i> PJ grinned despite the camera not being able to see it.</p><p>Phil smiled, <b><i>\u201dYou ready?\u201d </i></b>he asked, turning to Dan.</p><p>Trying his best to sound neutral,<i><b>\u201d Umm yep. Let\u2019s go find some ghostussy,\u201d</b></i> he nervously jokes.</p><p>Everyone chuckled at his joke, Phil made some joke to the camera in PJ\u2019s hand about Dan needing to be stopped.</p><p>Pulling his iPhone back out, Phil started to record as they made their way up the front steps of the house. Up to the rotting door that separated them from what laid inside the house. They all took a deep breath before Phil using the hand not holding his phone to pushed the heavy door open. The door creaked as it slowly swung open. That would be a great shot for the video Dan thought. Phil was the first one to go inside dragging Dan along with him. PJ and Sophie stumbled in after them.</p><p>Phil and PJ panned their cameras around to catch everyone\u2019s initial reaction to everything.</p><p>A cool shudder trickled down his spine. He glanced around nervously. Cold, hesitant light streamed in through a cracked window, casting eerie shadows on the walls. What was left of the abandon furniture was covered in sheets that had once been white but are now brown with years of dust and grime that had settled on them.</p><p><i><b>\u201cThis is so cool,\u201d </b></i>PJ whispered to his camera.</p><p>Phil nodded his head in agreement, <b><i>\u201dOh look at those portraits on the wall. The people almost look like their looking right through you!</i></b>\u201d he took his iPhone and zoomed in on a creepy looking painting of a man in a suit and top hat.</p><p>Dan shivered again, <i><b>\u201cWhat\u2019s that smell?\u201d</b></i> he asked in a small voice. It smelt like a combination of rotting wood and cigarette smoke.</p><p>His question went unanswered as Phil, PJ, and Sophie started exploring the first few rooms of the house. Pulling out his own iPhone to get his own footage he walked into what he assumed was as the dining room. In the middle of the room, there was a huge wooden table with a layer of dust covering it. He heard a rattle and looked up as a broken chandelier swayed in the draft. Trying to keep his wits, he showed the audience the swaying chandelier,<i><b> \u201cLooks like the ghost and ghouls are already performing for you guys.\u201d </b></i>Chuckling, he turned his attention to a small chest in the corner of the room, but just as he was about to open it and film what was inside he heard a scream.</p><p><i><b>\u201cShit!\u201d </b></i>Phil screamed from the adjoining room.</p><p>Shoving his phone in his pocket he sprinted through the walkway between the rooms, <i><b>\u201cPhil what\u2019s wrong are you alright?\u201d</b></i></p><p>Phil was clutching his chest breathing heavily, <i><b>\u201cYeah I just thought I saw something move in the corner over there.\u201d</b></i> He pointed his phone towards a corner of the room, \u201c<i><b>Turns out the house isn\u2019t as abandoned as we thought, there\u2019s a family of rats living here,</b></i>\u201d he breathed out chuckling nervously.</p><p>Just then PJ and Sophie came running in the room, \u201c<b><i>What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</i></b></p><p>They quickly explained what had happened, Phil now chuckling at how much he had freaked out. But they ultimately decided that it would probably be best if they stayed together just because if something else did happen they didn\u2019t want to scare someone else who might be on the other side of the house.</p><p>Once again both PJ and Phil pulled out their devices, recording as they walked through to the kitchen. Which was located in the back of the house.</p><p>Phil was showing the camera something on the counter when Dan stopped dead in his tracks, <i>\u201dDid you hear that?\u201d</i> he whispered.</p><p><i><b>\u201cWhat?\u201d</b></i> they all looked at him questioning.</p><p><b><i>\u201cI swear I heard footsteps above us,\u201d</i></b> he pointed towards the ceiling.</p><p><i><b>\u201cCome on Dan you\u2019re not being funny,\u201d</b></i> Sophie hissed, <b><i>\u201cStop messing around.\u201d</i></b></p><p><b><i>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to be, I know what I heard,\u201d</i></b> he defended himself.</p><p>\u201c<i><b>I\u2019m sure it was nothing,\u201d</b></i> Phil said, walking up and giving him a reassuring squeeze on the shoulder.</p><p>Dan glared at them, <i><b>\u201dI know I heard something!\u201d</b></i> he insisted</p><p>PJ turned his camera on himself, \u201cWell guys Dan thinks he heard something upstairs I say we should go investigate don\u2019t you think?\u201d he said giving a cheeky grin to the audience. \u00a0</p><p><i><b>\u201cYeah let\u2019s go!\u201d</b></i> Sophie chimed in clearly excited.</p><p>Phil turned to him, <b><i>\u201cwhat do you think?\u201d</i></b></p><p>He took a hold of Phil\u2019s hand knowing it would have to be edited out later. <b><i>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d</i></b> he said, trying to sound brave.</p><p>Phil chuckled and turned the camera back on himself, <i><b>\u201cIt\u2019s settled lads we\u2019re going upstairs to investigate!\u201d</b></i></p><p>They explored the upstairs without hearing anything else. They had decided it would be alright if they split up as long as they stayed in pairs so he and Phil were currently in one of the bedrooms. While PJ and Sophie went to investigate another room on the floor.</p><p>The bedroom was just like the rest of the house: everything in it was coated in a layer of dust.</p><p><i><b>\u201cDan come over here!\u201d</b></i> he heard Phil say from across the room.</p><p>He walked over to see what Phil was looking at. He rolled his eyes at what Phil had written. His iconic signature with a smiley face as well as, \u201d<i><b>Phan forever\u201d </b></i>right next to it.</p><p><b><i>\u201cDefacing property now Lester. What would the fans think of innocent Phil now?\u201d </i></b>he giggled.</p><p>\u201c<i><b>Hey it\u2019s not permanent so it doesn\u2019t count!\u201d</b></i></p><p>Dan giggled again as he leaned in and gave Phil a soft kiss on the lips.</p><p><i><b>\u201cDannnn that\u2019s just more editing,\u201d</b></i> Phil whined.</p><p><b><i>\u201cAnd isn\u2019t it just a coincidence you said you would do all the editing on this video Lester,\u201d</i></b> he grinned.</p><p>Phil huffed and accepted the second kiss Dan planted on his mouth.</p><p>A shiver curled through the hairs on the back of Dan\u2019s neck.</p><p><i><b>\u201cHey, you alright?\u201d </b></i>Phil asked.</p><p><i><b>\u201cI don\u2019t know I just got a funny feeling all of a sudden.\u201d</b></i></p><p>Phil looked at him concerned.</p><p><b><i>\u201cIs it me or did it get really fucking cold in here?\u201d </i></b>he shivered violently. \u00a0</p><p>Phil started shrugging his jacket off. \u201c<b><i>Here you can have my jack-.\u201d</i></b></p><p>When a loud crash interrupted him. Both of them jumped and screamed.</p><p>\u201c<i><b>What the fuck was that?\u201d</b></i> Dan asked as his heart ran a marathon inside his chest.</p><p>In his shaken state, Phil managed to answer<b><i>, \u201cLooks like the wind blew the door shut.\u201d</i></b></p><p><b><i>\u201cPhil are you really trying to me that was the fucking wind?!\u201d</i></b></p><p><b><i>\u201cWhat else could it hav-\u201d</i></b></p><p>Phil\u2019s face went white as he hissed in pain.</p><p><i><b>\u201cJesus Christ what happened?\u201d</b></i> Dan questioned him.</p><p><b><i>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I had a sudden pain in my back like something had burned me!\u201d </i></b>he screamed.</p><p>Phil finished taken his jacket off and lift his shirt up trying to see his own back. Finally admitting defeat he turned his back to Dan, <b><i>\u201cDo you see anything?\u201d</i></b></p><p>Dan felt all the remaining blood drain from his face.</p><p><i><b>\u201cWell do you see anything?\u201d </b></i>Phil huffed.</p><p><b><i>\u201cYou have three scratches on your back,\u201d</i></b> he whispered.</p><p><i><b>\u201cWhat was that,\u201d </b></i>he now turned around to face him.</p><p>\u201c<i><b>I said you have three long scratches going across your back,\u201d</b></i> he said a little bit louder.</p><p><b><i>\u201cWhat? This isn\u2019t the time to be pulling jokes, Dan,</i>\u201d</b> Phil scolded him.</p><p>Offended that Phil would think he was kidding he put his hands on the scratches, <i><b>\u201cYou think I would lie about that.\u201d </b></i>he asked pressing just enough into scratches that he could feel them.</p><p>Phil hissed, <i><b>\u201dJesus Christ!\u201d</b></i> he yelled.</p><p><i><b>\u201cI told you,\u201d</b></i> Dan said flatly.</p><p><i><b>\u201cI think we should probably find the others and leave,\u201d</b></i> Phil said after a moment.</p><p>Dan just nodded his head in agreement.</p><p>As they were exiting the bedroom there was a loud crash behind them. Spinning around to see the window that certainly wasn\u2019t broken a minute ago was no broken with shards of glass all over the floor.</p><p>Without a second thought, they turned back around and stumbled out of the room,<i><b> \u201cPJ! SOPHIE!\u201d</b></i> Phil yelled. There was no answer as they ran down the hallway to the other bedroom. They throw open every door on the floor and still couldn\u2019t find either of their friends.</p><p><i><b>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back I think we forgot that room at the end of the hall,\u201d </b></i>Phil said pointing to the room.</p><p>Dan didn\u2019t want to stay there by himself but it felt like he was wearing concrete shoes his feet wouldn\u2019t listen to his brain. \u00a0</p><p>Once again Dan felt the temperature drop and out of the corner of his eye he saw a dark shadowy figure dart behind a door right next to him.</p><p>He screamed at the top of his lungs and fell to the floor sobbing. Phil came rushing back down the hallway,<b><i>\u201d Dan! Dan! Are you ok?\u201d</i></b></p><p>He sobbed and shook his head. Phil enveloped him in a hug. \u201c<b><i>Shh, Shh it\u2019s alright.\u201d</i></b> He tried soothing him by rubbing circles on his back.</p><p>Eventually, his sobs turned to whimpers, <b><i>\u201cPhil can we please go home now?\u201d </i></b>he pleaded.</p><p><i><b>\u201cOf course, come on.\u201d</b></i> He helped Dan to his feet and wrapped his arm around his waist. With Phil\u2019s help, they made their way down the creaky old staircase.</p><p>Once they made it safely back outside Dan buried his head in Phil\u2019s chest. His salty tears now drying on Phil\u2019s shirt.</p><p><b><i>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry Dan, it was my idea to do this,\u201d</i></b> he said guilt in his voice.</p><p>He snuggled himself closer to Phil, <i><b>\u201dIt\u2019s alright Philly. Besides, I agreed that it would be an excellent video, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cYeah, but you tried backing out at the last minute and I made you come.\u201d</b></i></p><p>Dan cupped Phils face with his hand, \u201c<b><i>You didn\u2019t make me do anything. Now come on let\u2019s go.\u201d</i></b></p><p>\u201c<i><b>Ok. Yeah, let\u2019s see if PJ and Sophie went back to the cars.\u201d</b></i></p><p>Dan shivered as they started making their way back down the winding path. <i><b>\u201cHere take this.</b></i>\u201d Phil said as he draped his jacket that he was carrying over Dan\u2019s shoulders.\u201d</p><p><i><b>\u201cThanks,\u201d</b></i> he said burying his nose into it and taking a whiff of comfort and Phil.</p><p>They could see before they reached the cars that both their friends had obviously abandoned them earlier as they were huddled together sitting on the hood of Phil\u2019s rental car.</p><p><i><b>\u201cWhere did you guys go? We looked all over for you,</b></i>\u201d Phil yelled angrily.</p><p>Shocked, PJ tried defending himself, \u201c<b><i>Sorry, Soph thought she saw something and got scared. We couldn\u2019t find you guys so we figured you had come out to the car without telling us.\u201d</i></b></p><p><i><b>\u201cThat\u2019s no ex-\u201d</b></i></p><p>He was cut off by Sophie, <b><i>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. It happened so fast and all I could think about was getting out of there,\u201d </i></b>she admitted. \u201c<i><b>Oh god Dan did something happen? You look shaken.\u201d</b></i> She wrapped her arms around him bringing him in for a hug. He stayed limp as she hugged him.</p><p>Phil grunted as he took hold of Dan\u2019s arm, <i><b>\u201cListen I\u2019m sorry guys we can go over footage and stuff later. We\u2019re both pretty shaken up and need to get home.\u201d</b></i></p><p>They said goodbye to each other with the promise that sometime over the next few days they would get together and go over and footage that they had.</p><p>The ride home was as silent has it had been on the way there. Neither of them said anything until they were safely back in their apartment.</p><p><i><b>\u201cListen, Dan, I feel so bad,\u201d </b></i>Phil said rubbing the back of his neck.</p><p>He was a little more calmed down then he was before so he leaned in and placed a chaste kiss on Phil\u2019s lips. Pulling back. <i><b>\u201cPhil I already told you it\u2019s not your fault. That place was just creepy as hell,\u201d</b></i> he tried to smile. <i><b>\u201cI can\u2019t explain anything that happened tonight, but I do know that none of it\u2019s your fault.</b></i></p><p>Phil still didn\u2019t look convinced but after a few minutes he spoke, <b><i>\u201cDo you want me to make some hot chocolate and maybe we could snuggle on the couch and watch a disney movie?\u201d </i></b>he asked hopefully.</p><p>He smiled, <i><b>\u201cOf course. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</b></i></p><p>A smile appeared on Phil\u2019s face. He took Dan\u2019s hand and lead the way up the kitchen to get their drinks.</p><p><i><b>\u201cRemember you\u2019re still the one editing the footage,\u201d </b></i>Dan teased him.</p><p>Phil chuckled. Some weird things happened tonight but it would most certainly make for a great video.</p>",

And it won\u2019t be much of a video without you,\u201d</b></i> he reminded him.</p><p>Dan rolled his eyes, <i><b>\u201cFiiine I\u2019ll go, we\u2019ll do it.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cYes!\u201d</b></i> Phil grinned pumping his fist in the air in victory.</p><p>Turning to Phil, <i><b>\u201cWhat time do we have to meet them there again?\u201d</b></i></p><p>Phil glanced down at his phone, <i><b>\u201dShit we probably should have left already.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cReally Phil?</b></i>\u201d he exclaimed as he frantically tried shoving his shoes on his feet.</p><p><b><i>\u201cWell if somebody hadn\u2019t of waited to the last minute to decide they were going it wouldn\u2019t have been a probl-.\u201d</i></b></p><p>Dan turned around and glared at him.</p><p>Not wanting to fight, Phil held his hands up in the air in defeat.</p><p>The house planned to \u201cghost hunt\u201d was a fairly known place. For years there had been rumors of the awful things that had happened there. One of the main stories was that there was a family living there in the 60\u2019s and one night the father had murdered the entire family including the family dog. The other main story people liked to tell about this place was that back in the 1900\u2019s the place used to be a small mental hospital where the doctors performed unspeakable experiments and acts of torture on the patients that had resulted in several deaths. Of course, no one knew if either of these stories were true or not but that hasn\u2019t stopped people from sneaking into the house over the years trying to see if the ghosts were real.</p><p>And since the house was out in the middle of nowhere they had to rent a car instead of taking a cab. Because when Phil had called to set this all up the cab company outright refused to take them since it was so far out of town.</p><p>They have never been known for their punctuality but this was ridiculous, Dan thought as they drove in silence. They had promised a video with PJ and Sophie to the fans and he hoped they hadn\u2019t left or started without them. \u00a0</p><p>Dan fidgeted in the passenger\u2019s seat of the rented car, too nervous to sit still. <i><b>\u201cWho\u2019s idea was it to film a video in an abandoned haunted house again?\u201d</b></i></p><p>Phil glanced at him out of the corner of his eye,<i><b> \u201dHey you ok?\u201d </b></i>Dan nodded his head. <i><b>\u201cAre you sure? We don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d</b></i> Concern showed on his face. <i><b>\u201cThe fans will understand.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine. Besides, they\u2019ll never let us live this down if we don\u2019t do it,\u201d</b></i> he chuckled, giving Phil a shaky smile. Phil reached over and placed one of his hands on Dan\u2019s leg. Dan let out a little sigh of relief just feeling Phil\u2019s hand made him feel safe and comforted. \u00a0</p><p>They pulled up to the big iron gates that sat a few hundred feet from the house. When Phil had talked to the owner of the property they had told him that they would have to walk up to the house from there. He had explained if he left the gate open it tended to draw in people who just wanted to come in and squat in it or vandalize the house.</p><p>Seeing PJ\u2019s car still there made Phil sigh in relief knowing they were still there he just hoped they hadn\u2019t started without them. Phil took ahold of Dan\u2019s hand and they started walking up the dark winding path that leads up the house. The path was small and overrun with bushes and shrubs making it almost impossible to see. \u00a0</p><p>The house came into view as they rounded a tree Dan\u2019s heart dropped in his chest. Why had he agreed to this? What idiots went to an abandoned house in the middle of nowhere on Halloween night of all nights. Plus it was a fucking full moon to boot.</p><p>Phil took out his iPhone and started to record himself.</p><p><b><i>\u201cHey, guys! So after a long drive, we are finally here! Who\u2019s excited to see some spooky things?\u201d </i></b>He then turned the phone to record the exterior of the house. The house was huge, dingy, and the grey paint flaked on the outside, the window panes were smeared with age and dirt and its brickwork was crumbling away. And like the path leading to the house, the path going up to the door was also overgrown with bushes and brambles.</p><p><b><i>\u201cSo Dan are you ready to see some ghosts?\u201d </i></b>Phil joked as he panned the camera over to him. He couldn\u2019t see his own face at the moment but if he had to guess he probably looked terrified. He tried as hard as he could to plaster on his video persona, <b><i>\u201cSo yeah here we are. Uhh, so we\u2019re going to try and catch something spooky and fun for you guys.\u201d</i></b> He rubbed the back of his neck, <i><b>\u201cSo yeah here we go, and I guess if this video never gets put up then that means we died,\u201d</b></i> he chuckled, being slightly serious about the dying part.</p><p>Phil turned the phone back to himself and said a few more things about the history and the supposed stories of the house before he hit the stop record button.</p><p>Seeing he wasn\u2019t recording anymore Dan grabbed Phil\u2019s hand <i><b>\u201cPhil I don\u2019t know about this,\u201d</b></i> he said, expressing his uncertainty.</p><p>Phil chuckled<b><i>,\u201d Come on it isn\u2019t so bad.\u201d</i></b> Dan looked back at the house. Yep, still as bad as it had been a minute ago.</p><p><i><b>\u201cOh look there\u2019s PJ and Sophie.\u201d</b></i> He waved over to their friends who had just walked from around the house.</p><p><i><b>\u201cWe thought we heard talking.\u201d</b></i> Sophie smiled brightly at them.</p><p><i><b>\u201cYeah, we just got here,\u201d</b></i> Phil said as he pulled Dan\u2019s shivering body closer to him.</p><p>\u201c<b><i>Hey, guys we weren\u2019t sure if you were coming or not.\u201d</i></b> Their friend\u2019s jogged over to them.</p><p>\u201c<i><b>Sorry uh, we lost track of time,\u201d </b></i>Phil explained.</p><p>Dan squeezed Phil\u2019s hand letting him know that he was grateful he hadn\u2019t mentioned how he had been scared.</p><p><b><i>\u201cWe were just recording the back of the place anyway, we didn\u2019t want to start without you guys,\u201d</i></b> PJ said pulling his camera out of his bag.</p><p>Turning it on he pointed it and him and Phil, <i><b>\u201cLook how it is guys! Dan and Phil have offered to come on this crazy adventure with us! So are you guys ready?\u201d</b></i> PJ grinned despite the camera not being able to see it.</p><p>Phil smiled, <b><i>\u201dYou ready?\u201d </i></b>he asked, turning to Dan.</p><p>Trying his best to sound neutral,<i><b>\u201d Umm yep. Let\u2019s go find some ghostussy,\u201d</b></i> he nervously jokes.</p><p>Everyone chuckled at his joke, Phil made some joke to the camera in PJ\u2019s hand about Dan needing to be stopped.</p><p>Pulling his iPhone back out, Phil started to record as they made their way up the front steps of the house. Up to the rotting door that separated them from what laid inside the house. They all took a deep breath before Phil using the hand not holding his phone to pushed the heavy door open. The door creaked as it slowly swung open. That would be a great shot for the video Dan thought. Phil was the first one to go inside dragging Dan along with him. PJ and Sophie stumbled in after them.</p><p>Phil and PJ panned their cameras around to catch everyone\u2019s initial reaction to everything.</p><p>A cool shudder trickled down his spine. He glanced around nervously. Cold, hesitant light streamed in through a cracked window, casting eerie shadows on the walls. What was left of the abandon furniture was covered in sheets that had once been white but are now brown with years of dust and grime that had settled on them.</p><p><i><b>\u201cThis is so cool,\u201d </b></i>PJ whispered to his camera.</p><p>Phil nodded his head in agreement, <b><i>\u201dOh look at those portraits on the wall. The people almost look like their looking right through you!</i></b>\u201d he took his iPhone and zoomed in on a creepy looking painting of a man in a suit and top hat.</p><p>Dan shivered again, <i><b>\u201cWhat\u2019s that smell?\u201d</b></i> he asked in a small voice. It smelt like a combination of rotting wood and cigarette smoke.</p><p>His question went unanswered as Phil, PJ, and Sophie started exploring the first few rooms of the house. Pulling out his own iPhone to get his own footage he walked into what he assumed was as the dining room. In the middle of the room, there was a huge wooden table with a layer of dust covering it. He heard a rattle and looked up as a broken chandelier swayed in the draft. Trying to keep his wits, he showed the audience the swaying chandelier,<i><b> \u201cLooks like the ghost and ghouls are already performing for you guys.\u201d </b></i>Chuckling, he turned his attention to a small chest in the corner of the room, but just as he was about to open it and film what was inside he heard a scream.</p><p><i><b>\u201cShit!\u201d </b></i>Phil screamed from the adjoining room.</p><p>Shoving his phone in his pocket he sprinted through the walkway between the rooms, <i><b>\u201cPhil what\u2019s wrong are you alright?\u201d</b></i></p><p>Phil was clutching his chest breathing heavily, <i><b>\u201cYeah I just thought I saw something move in the corner over there.\u201d</b></i> He pointed his phone towards a corner of the room, \u201c<i><b>Turns out the house isn\u2019t as abandoned as we thought, there\u2019s a family of rats living here,</b></i>\u201d he breathed out chuckling nervously.</p><p>Just then PJ and Sophie came running in the room, \u201c<b><i>What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</i></b></p><p>They quickly explained what had happened, Phil now chuckling at how much he had freaked out. But they ultimately decided that it would probably be best if they stayed together just because if something else did happen they didn\u2019t want to scare someone else who might be on the other side of the house.</p><p>Once again both PJ and Phil pulled out their devices, recording as they walked through to the kitchen. Which was located in the back of the house.</p><p>Phil was showing the camera something on the counter when Dan stopped dead in his tracks, <i>\u201dDid you hear that?\u201d</i> he whispered.</p><p><i><b>\u201cWhat?\u201d</b></i> they all looked at him questioning.</p><p><b><i>\u201cI swear I heard footsteps above us,\u201d</i></b> he pointed towards the ceiling.</p><p><i><b>\u201cCome on Dan you\u2019re not being funny,\u201d</b></i> Sophie hissed, <b><i>\u201cStop messing around.\u201d</i></b></p><p><b><i>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to be, I know what I heard,\u201d</i></b> he defended himself.</p><p>\u201c<i><b>I\u2019m sure it was nothing,\u201d</b></i> Phil said, walking up and giving him a reassuring squeeze on the shoulder.</p><p>Dan glared at them, <i><b>\u201dI know I heard something!\u201d</b></i> he insisted</p><p>PJ turned his camera on himself, \u201cWell guys Dan thinks he heard something upstairs I say we should go investigate don\u2019t you think?\u201d he said giving a cheeky grin to the audience. \u00a0</p><p><i><b>\u201cYeah let\u2019s go!\u201d</b></i> Sophie chimed in clearly excited.</p><p>Phil turned to him, <b><i>\u201cwhat do you think?\u201d</i></b></p><p>He took a hold of Phil\u2019s hand knowing it would have to be edited out later. <b><i>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d</i></b> he said, trying to sound brave.</p><p>Phil chuckled and turned the camera back on himself, <i><b>\u201cIt\u2019s settled lads we\u2019re going upstairs to investigate!\u201d</b></i></p><p>They explored the upstairs without hearing anything else. They had decided it would be alright if they split up as long as they stayed in pairs so he and Phil were currently in one of the bedrooms. While PJ and Sophie went to investigate another room on the floor.</p><p>The bedroom was just like the rest of the house: everything in it was coated in a layer of dust.</p><p><i><b>\u201cDan come over here!\u201d</b></i> he heard Phil say from across the room.</p><p>He walked over to see what Phil was looking at. He rolled his eyes at what Phil had written. His iconic signature with a smiley face as well as, \u201d<i><b>Phan forever\u201d </b></i>right next to it.</p><p><b><i>\u201cDefacing property now Lester. What would the fans think of innocent Phil now?\u201d </i></b>he giggled.</p><p>\u201c<i><b>Hey it\u2019s not permanent so it doesn\u2019t count!\u201d</b></i></p><p>Dan giggled again as he leaned in and gave Phil a soft kiss on the lips.</p><p><i><b>\u201cDannnn that\u2019s just more editing,\u201d</b></i> Phil whined.</p><p><b><i>\u201cAnd isn\u2019t it just a coincidence you said you would do all the editing on this video Lester,\u201d</i></b> he grinned.</p><p>Phil huffed and accepted the second kiss Dan planted on his mouth.</p><p>A shiver curled through the hairs on the back of Dan\u2019s neck.</p><p><i><b>\u201cHey, you alright?\u201d </b></i>Phil asked.</p><p><i><b>\u201cI don\u2019t know I just got a funny feeling all of a sudden.\u201d</b></i></p><p>Phil looked at him concerned.</p><p><b><i>\u201cIs it me or did it get really fucking cold in here?\u201d </i></b>he shivered violently. \u00a0</p><p>Phil started shrugging his jacket off. \u201c<b><i>Here you can have my jack-.\u201d</i></b></p><p>When a loud crash interrupted him. Both of them jumped and screamed.</p><p>\u201c<i><b>What the fuck was that?\u201d</b></i> Dan asked as his heart ran a marathon inside his chest.</p><p>In his shaken state, Phil managed to answer<b><i>, \u201cLooks like the wind blew the door shut.\u201d</i></b></p><p><b><i>\u201cPhil are you really trying to me that was the fucking wind?!\u201d</i></b></p><p><b><i>\u201cWhat else could it hav-\u201d</i></b></p><p>Phil\u2019s face went white as he hissed in pain.</p><p><i><b>\u201cJesus Christ what happened?\u201d</b></i> Dan questioned him.</p><p><b><i>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I had a sudden pain in my back like something had burned me!\u201d </i></b>he screamed.</p><p>Phil finished taken his jacket off and lift his shirt up trying to see his own back. Finally admitting defeat he turned his back to Dan, <b><i>\u201cDo you see anything?\u201d</i></b></p><p>Dan felt all the remaining blood drain from his face.</p><p><i><b>\u201cWell do you see anything?\u201d </b></i>Phil huffed.</p><p><b><i>\u201cYou have three scratches on your back,\u201d</i></b> he whispered.</p><p><i><b>\u201cWhat was that,\u201d </b></i>he now turned around to face him.</p><p>\u201c<i><b>I said you have three long scratches going across your back,\u201d</b></i> he said a little bit louder.</p><p><b><i>\u201cWhat? This isn\u2019t the time to be pulling jokes, Dan,</i>\u201d</b> Phil scolded him.</p><p>Offended that Phil would think he was kidding he put his hands on the scratches, <i><b>\u201cYou think I would lie about that.\u201d </b></i>he asked pressing just enough into scratches that he could feel them.</p><p>Phil hissed, <i><b>\u201dJesus Christ!\u201d</b></i> he yelled.</p><p><i><b>\u201cI told you,\u201d</b></i> Dan said flatly.</p><p><i><b>\u201cI think we should probably find the others and leave,\u201d</b></i> Phil said after a moment.</p><p>Dan just nodded his head in agreement.</p><p>As they were exiting the bedroom there was a loud crash behind them. Spinning around to see the window that certainly wasn\u2019t broken a minute ago was no broken with shards of glass all over the floor.</p><p>Without a second thought, they turned back around and stumbled out of the room,<i><b> \u201cPJ! SOPHIE!\u201d</b></i> Phil yelled. There was no answer as they ran down the hallway to the other bedroom. They throw open every door on the floor and still couldn\u2019t find either of their friends.</p><p><i><b>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back I think we forgot that room at the end of the hall,\u201d </b></i>Phil said pointing to the room.</p><p>Dan didn\u2019t want to stay there by himself but it felt like he was wearing concrete shoes his feet wouldn\u2019t listen to his brain. \u00a0</p><p>Once again Dan felt the temperature drop and out of the corner of his eye he saw a dark shadowy figure dart behind a door right next to him.</p><p>He screamed at the top of his lungs and fell to the floor sobbing. Phil came rushing back down the hallway,<b><i>\u201d Dan! Dan! Are you ok?\u201d</i></b></p><p>He sobbed and shook his head. Phil enveloped him in a hug. \u201c<b><i>Shh, Shh it\u2019s alright.\u201d</i></b> He tried soothing him by rubbing circles on his back.</p><p>Eventually, his sobs turned to whimpers, <b><i>\u201cPhil can we please go home now?\u201d </i></b>he pleaded.</p><p><i><b>\u201cOf course, come on.\u201d</b></i> He helped Dan to his feet and wrapped his arm around his waist. With Phil\u2019s help, they made their way down the creaky old staircase.</p><p>Once they made it safely back outside Dan buried his head in Phil\u2019s chest. His salty tears now drying on Phil\u2019s shirt.</p><p><b><i>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry Dan, it was my idea to do this,\u201d</i></b> he said guilt in his voice.</p><p>He snuggled himself closer to Phil, <i><b>\u201dIt\u2019s alright Philly. Besides, I agreed that it would be an excellent video, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cYeah, but you tried backing out at the last minute and I made you come.\u201d</b></i></p><p>Dan cupped Phils face with his hand, \u201c<b><i>You didn\u2019t make me do anything. Now come on let\u2019s go.\u201d</i></b></p><p>\u201c<i><b>Ok. Yeah, let\u2019s see if PJ and Sophie went back to the cars.\u201d</b></i></p><p>Dan shivered as they started making their way back down the winding path. <i><b>\u201cHere take this.</b></i>\u201d Phil said as he draped his jacket that he was carrying over Dan\u2019s shoulders.\u201d</p><p><i><b>\u201cThanks,\u201d</b></i> he said burying his nose into it and taking a whiff of comfort and Phil.</p><p>They could see before they reached the cars that both their friends had obviously abandoned them earlier as they were huddled together sitting on the hood of Phil\u2019s rental car.</p><p><i><b>\u201cWhere did you guys go? We looked all over for you,</b></i>\u201d Phil yelled angrily.</p><p>Shocked, PJ tried defending himself, \u201c<b><i>Sorry, Soph thought she saw something and got scared. We couldn\u2019t find you guys so we figured you had come out to the car without telling us.\u201d</i></b></p><p><i><b>\u201cThat\u2019s no ex-\u201d</b></i></p><p>He was cut off by Sophie, <b><i>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. It happened so fast and all I could think about was getting out of there,\u201d </i></b>she admitted. \u201c<i><b>Oh god Dan did something happen? You look shaken.\u201d</b></i> She wrapped her arms around him bringing him in for a hug. He stayed limp as she hugged him.</p><p>Phil grunted as he took hold of Dan\u2019s arm, <i><b>\u201cListen I\u2019m sorry guys we can go over footage and stuff later. We\u2019re both pretty shaken up and need to get home.\u201d</b></i></p><p>They said goodbye to each other with the promise that sometime over the next few days they would get together and go over and footage that they had.</p><p>The ride home was as silent has it had been on the way there. Neither of them said anything until they were safely back in their apartment.</p><p><i><b>\u201cListen, Dan, I feel so bad,\u201d </b></i>Phil said rubbing the back of his neck.</p><p>He was a little more calmed down then he was before so he leaned in and placed a chaste kiss on Phil\u2019s lips.

And it won&rsquo;t be much of a video without you,&rdquo;</b></i> he reminded him.</p><p>Dan rolled his eyes, <i><b>&ldquo;Fiiine I&rsquo;ll go, we&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</b></i> Phil grinned pumping his fist in the air in victory.</p><p>Turning to Phil, <i><b>&ldquo;What time do we have to meet them there again?&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>Phil glanced down at his phone, <i><b>&rdquo;Shit we probably should have left already.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Really Phil?</b></i>&rdquo; he exclaimed as he frantically tried shoving his shoes on his feet.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Well if somebody hadn&rsquo;t of waited to the last minute to decide they were going it wouldn&rsquo;t have been a probl-.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>Dan turned around and glared at him.</p><p>Not wanting to fight, Phil held his hands up in the air in defeat.</p><p>The house planned to &ldquo;ghost hunt&rdquo; was a fairly known place. For years there had been rumors of the awful things that had happened there. One of the main stories was that there was a family living there in the 60&rsquo;s and one night the father had murdered the entire family including the family dog. The other main story people liked to tell about this place was that back in the 1900&rsquo;s the place used to be a small mental hospital where the doctors performed unspeakable experiments and acts of torture on the patients that had resulted in several deaths. Of course, no one knew if either of these stories were true or not but that hasn&rsquo;t stopped people from sneaking into the house over the years trying to see if the ghosts were real.</p><p>And since the house was out in the middle of nowhere they had to rent a car instead of taking a cab. Because when Phil had called to set this all up the cab company outright refused to take them since it was so far out of town.</p><p>They have never been known for their punctuality but this was ridiculous, Dan thought as they drove in silence. They had promised a video with PJ and Sophie to the fans and he hoped they hadn&rsquo;t left or started without them. &nbsp;</p><p>Dan fidgeted in the passenger&rsquo;s seat of the rented car, too nervous to sit still. <i><b>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s idea was it to film a video in an abandoned haunted house again?&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>Phil glanced at him out of the corner of his eye,<i><b> &rdquo;Hey you ok?&rdquo; </b></i>Dan nodded his head. <i><b>&ldquo;Are you sure? We don&rsquo;t have to do this.&rdquo;</b></i> Concern showed on his face. <i><b>&ldquo;The fans will understand.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m fine. Besides, they&rsquo;ll never let us live this down if we don&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo;</b></i> he chuckled, giving Phil a shaky smile. Phil reached over and placed one of his hands on Dan&rsquo;s leg. Dan let out a little sigh of relief just feeling Phil&rsquo;s hand made him feel safe and comforted. &nbsp;</p><p>They pulled up to the big iron gates that sat a few hundred feet from the house. When Phil had talked to the owner of the property they had told him that they would have to walk up to the house from there. He had explained if he left the gate open it tended to draw in people who just wanted to come in and squat in it or vandalize the house.</p><p>Seeing PJ&rsquo;s car still there made Phil sigh in relief knowing they were still there he just hoped they hadn&rsquo;t started without them. Phil took ahold of Dan&rsquo;s hand and they started walking up the dark winding path that leads up the house. The path was small and overrun with bushes and shrubs making it almost impossible to see. &nbsp;</p><p>The house came into view as they rounded a tree Dan&rsquo;s heart dropped in his chest. Why had he agreed to this? What idiots went to an abandoned house in the middle of nowhere on Halloween night of all nights. Plus it was a fucking full moon to boot.</p><p>Phil took out his iPhone and started to record himself.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Hey, guys! So after a long drive, we are finally here! Who&rsquo;s excited to see some spooky things?&rdquo; </i></b>He then turned the phone to record the exterior of the house. The house was huge, dingy, and the grey paint flaked on the outside, the window panes were smeared with age and dirt and its brickwork was crumbling away. And like the path leading to the house, the path going up to the door was also overgrown with bushes and brambles.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;So Dan are you ready to see some ghosts?&rdquo; </i></b>Phil joked as he panned the camera over to him. He couldn&rsquo;t see his own face at the moment but if he had to guess he probably looked terrified. He tried as hard as he could to plaster on his video persona, <b><i>&ldquo;So yeah here we are. Uhh, so we&rsquo;re going to try and catch something spooky and fun for you guys.&rdquo;</i></b> He rubbed the back of his neck, <i><b>&ldquo;So yeah here we go, and I guess if this video never gets put up then that means we died,&rdquo;</b></i> he chuckled, being slightly serious about the dying part.</p><p>Phil turned the phone back to himself and said a few more things about the history and the supposed stories of the house before he hit the stop record button.</p><p>Seeing he wasn&rsquo;t recording anymore Dan grabbed Phil&rsquo;s hand <i><b>&ldquo;Phil I don&rsquo;t know about this,&rdquo;</b></i> he said, expressing his uncertainty.</p><p>Phil chuckled<b><i>,&rdquo; Come on it isn&rsquo;t so bad.&rdquo;</i></b> Dan looked back at the house. Yep, still as bad as it had been a minute ago.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Oh look there&rsquo;s PJ and Sophie.&rdquo;</b></i> He waved over to their friends who had just walked from around the house.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;We thought we heard talking.&rdquo;</b></i> Sophie smiled brightly at them.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Yeah, we just got here,&rdquo;</b></i> Phil said as he pulled Dan&rsquo;s shivering body closer to him.</p><p>&ldquo;<b><i>Hey, guys we weren&rsquo;t sure if you were coming or not.&rdquo;</i></b> Their friend&rsquo;s jogged over to them.</p><p>&ldquo;<i><b>Sorry uh, we lost track of time,&rdquo; </b></i>Phil explained.</p><p>Dan squeezed Phil&rsquo;s hand letting him know that he was grateful he hadn&rsquo;t mentioned how he had been scared.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;We were just recording the back of the place anyway, we didn&rsquo;t want to start without you guys,&rdquo;</i></b> PJ said pulling his camera out of his bag.</p><p>Turning it on he pointed it and him and Phil, <i><b>&ldquo;Look how it is guys! Dan and Phil have offered to come on this crazy adventure with us! So are you guys ready?&rdquo;</b></i> PJ grinned despite the camera not being able to see it.</p><p>Phil smiled, <b><i>&rdquo;You ready?&rdquo; </i></b>he asked, turning to Dan.</p><p>Trying his best to sound neutral,<i><b>&rdquo; Umm yep. Let&rsquo;s go find some ghostussy,&rdquo;</b></i> he nervously jokes.</p><p>Everyone chuckled at his joke, Phil made some joke to the camera in PJ&rsquo;s hand about Dan needing to be stopped.</p><p>Pulling his iPhone back out, Phil started to record as they made their way up the front steps of the house. Up to the rotting door that separated them from what laid inside the house. They all took a deep breath before Phil using the hand not holding his phone to pushed the heavy door open. The door creaked as it slowly swung open. That would be a great shot for the video Dan thought. Phil was the first one to go inside dragging Dan along with him. PJ and Sophie stumbled in after them.</p><p>Phil and PJ panned their cameras around to catch everyone&rsquo;s initial reaction to everything.</p><p>A cool shudder trickled down his spine. He glanced around nervously. Cold, hesitant light streamed in through a cracked window, casting eerie shadows on the walls. What was left of the abandon furniture was covered in sheets that had once been white but are now brown with years of dust and grime that had settled on them.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;This is so cool,&rdquo; </b></i>PJ whispered to his camera.</p><p>Phil nodded his head in agreement, <b><i>&rdquo;Oh look at those portraits on the wall. The people almost look like their looking right through you!</i></b>&rdquo; he took his iPhone and zoomed in on a creepy looking painting of a man in a suit and top hat.</p><p>Dan shivered again, <i><b>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that smell?&rdquo;</b></i> he asked in a small voice. It smelt like a combination of rotting wood and cigarette smoke.</p><p>His question went unanswered as Phil, PJ, and Sophie started exploring the first few rooms of the house. Pulling out his own iPhone to get his own footage he walked into what he assumed was as the dining room. In the middle of the room, there was a huge wooden table with a layer of dust covering it. He heard a rattle and looked up as a broken chandelier swayed in the draft. Trying to keep his wits, he showed the audience the swaying chandelier,<i><b> &ldquo;Looks like the ghost and ghouls are already performing for you guys.&rdquo; </b></i>Chuckling, he turned his attention to a small chest in the corner of the room, but just as he was about to open it and film what was inside he heard a scream.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Shit!&rdquo; </b></i>Phil screamed from the adjoining room.</p><p>Shoving his phone in his pocket he sprinted through the walkway between the rooms, <i><b>&ldquo;Phil what&rsquo;s wrong are you alright?&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>Phil was clutching his chest breathing heavily, <i><b>&ldquo;Yeah I just thought I saw something move in the corner over there.&rdquo;</b></i> He pointed his phone towards a corner of the room, &ldquo;<i><b>Turns out the house isn&rsquo;t as abandoned as we thought, there&rsquo;s a family of rats living here,</b></i>&rdquo; he breathed out chuckling nervously.</p><p>Just then PJ and Sophie came running in the room, &ldquo;<b><i>What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>They quickly explained what had happened, Phil now chuckling at how much he had freaked out. But they ultimately decided that it would probably be best if they stayed together just because if something else did happen they didn&rsquo;t want to scare someone else who might be on the other side of the house.</p><p>Once again both PJ and Phil pulled out their devices, recording as they walked through to the kitchen. Which was located in the back of the house.</p><p>Phil was showing the camera something on the counter when Dan stopped dead in his tracks, <i>&rdquo;Did you hear that?&rdquo;</i> he whispered.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</b></i> they all looked at him questioning.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;I swear I heard footsteps above us,&rdquo;</i></b> he pointed towards the ceiling.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Come on Dan you&rsquo;re not being funny,&rdquo;</b></i> Sophie hissed, <b><i>&ldquo;Stop messing around.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not trying to be, I know what I heard,&rdquo;</i></b> he defended himself.</p><p>&ldquo;<i><b>I&rsquo;m sure it was nothing,&rdquo;</b></i> Phil said, walking up and giving him a reassuring squeeze on the shoulder.</p><p>Dan glared at them, <i><b>&rdquo;I know I heard something!&rdquo;</b></i> he insisted</p><p>PJ turned his camera on himself, &ldquo;Well guys Dan thinks he heard something upstairs I say we should go investigate don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo; he said giving a cheeky grin to the audience. &nbsp;</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Yeah let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</b></i> Sophie chimed in clearly excited.</p><p>Phil turned to him, <b><i>&ldquo;what do you think?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>He took a hold of Phil&rsquo;s hand knowing it would have to be edited out later. <b><i>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo;</i></b> he said, trying to sound brave.</p><p>Phil chuckled and turned the camera back on himself, <i><b>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s settled lads we&rsquo;re going upstairs to investigate!&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>They explored the upstairs without hearing anything else. They had decided it would be alright if they split up as long as they stayed in pairs so he and Phil were currently in one of the bedrooms. While PJ and Sophie went to investigate another room on the floor.</p><p>The bedroom was just like the rest of the house: everything in it was coated in a layer of dust.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Dan come over here!&rdquo;</b></i> he heard Phil say from across the room.</p><p>He walked over to see what Phil was looking at. He rolled his eyes at what Phil had written. His iconic signature with a smiley face as well as, &rdquo;<i><b>Phan forever&rdquo; </b></i>right next to it.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Defacing property now Lester. What would the fans think of innocent Phil now?&rdquo; </i></b>he giggled.</p><p>&ldquo;<i><b>Hey it&rsquo;s not permanent so it doesn&rsquo;t count!&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>Dan giggled again as he leaned in and gave Phil a soft kiss on the lips.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Dannnn that&rsquo;s just more editing,&rdquo;</b></i> Phil whined.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;And isn&rsquo;t it just a coincidence you said you would do all the editing on this video Lester,&rdquo;</i></b> he grinned.</p><p>Phil huffed and accepted the second kiss Dan planted on his mouth.</p><p>A shiver curled through the hairs on the back of Dan&rsquo;s neck.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Hey, you alright?&rdquo; </b></i>Phil asked.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know I just got a funny feeling all of a sudden.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>Phil looked at him concerned.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Is it me or did it get really fucking cold in here?&rdquo; </i></b>he shivered violently. &nbsp;</p><p>Phil started shrugging his jacket off. &ldquo;<b><i>Here you can have my jack-.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>When a loud crash interrupted him. Both of them jumped and screamed.</p><p>&ldquo;<i><b>What the fuck was that?&rdquo;</b></i> Dan asked as his heart ran a marathon inside his chest.</p><p>In his shaken state, Phil managed to answer<b><i>, &ldquo;Looks like the wind blew the door shut.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Phil are you really trying to me that was the fucking wind?!&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;What else could it hav-&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>Phil&rsquo;s face went white as he hissed in pain.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Jesus Christ what happened?&rdquo;</b></i> Dan questioned him.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I had a sudden pain in my back like something had burned me!&rdquo; </i></b>he screamed.</p><p>Phil finished taken his jacket off and lift his shirt up trying to see his own back. Finally admitting defeat he turned his back to Dan, <b><i>&ldquo;Do you see anything?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>Dan felt all the remaining blood drain from his face.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Well do you see anything?&rdquo; </b></i>Phil huffed.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;You have three scratches on your back,&rdquo;</i></b> he whispered.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;What was that,&rdquo; </b></i>he now turned around to face him.</p><p>&ldquo;<i><b>I said you have three long scratches going across your back,&rdquo;</b></i> he said a little bit louder.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;What? This isn&rsquo;t the time to be pulling jokes, Dan,</i>&rdquo;</b> Phil scolded him.</p><p>Offended that Phil would think he was kidding he put his hands on the scratches, <i><b>&ldquo;You think I would lie about that.&rdquo; </b></i>he asked pressing just enough into scratches that he could feel them.</p><p>Phil hissed, <i><b>&rdquo;Jesus Christ!&rdquo;</b></i> he yelled.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;I told you,&rdquo;</b></i> Dan said flatly.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;I think we should probably find the others and leave,&rdquo;</b></i> Phil said after a moment.</p><p>Dan just nodded his head in agreement.</p><p>As they were exiting the bedroom there was a loud crash behind them. Spinning around to see the window that certainly wasn&rsquo;t broken a minute ago was no broken with shards of glass all over the floor.</p><p>Without a second thought, they turned back around and stumbled out of the room,<i><b> &ldquo;PJ! SOPHIE!&rdquo;</b></i> Phil yelled. There was no answer as they ran down the hallway to the other bedroom. They throw open every door on the floor and still couldn&rsquo;t find either of their friends.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right back I think we forgot that room at the end of the hall,&rdquo; </b></i>Phil said pointing to the room.</p><p>Dan didn&rsquo;t want to stay there by himself but it felt like he was wearing concrete shoes his feet wouldn&rsquo;t listen to his brain. &nbsp;</p><p>Once again Dan felt the temperature drop and out of the corner of his eye he saw a dark shadowy figure dart behind a door right next to him.</p><p>He screamed at the top of his lungs and fell to the floor sobbing. Phil came rushing back down the hallway,<b><i>&rdquo; Dan! Dan! Are you ok?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>He sobbed and shook his head. Phil enveloped him in a hug. &ldquo;<b><i>Shh, Shh it&rsquo;s alright.&rdquo;</i></b> He tried soothing him by rubbing circles on his back.</p><p>Eventually, his sobs turned to whimpers, <b><i>&ldquo;Phil can we please go home now?&rdquo; </i></b>he pleaded.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Of course, come on.&rdquo;</b></i> He helped Dan to his feet and wrapped his arm around his waist. With Phil&rsquo;s help, they made their way down the creaky old staircase.</p><p>Once they made it safely back outside Dan buried his head in Phil&rsquo;s chest. His salty tears now drying on Phil&rsquo;s shirt.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry Dan, it was my idea to do this,&rdquo;</i></b> he said guilt in his voice.</p><p>He snuggled himself closer to Phil, <i><b>&rdquo;It&rsquo;s alright Philly. Besides, I agreed that it would be an excellent video, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Yeah, but you tried backing out at the last minute and I made you come.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>Dan cupped Phils face with his hand, &ldquo;<b><i>You didn&rsquo;t make me do anything. Now come on let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>&ldquo;<i><b>Ok. Yeah, let&rsquo;s see if PJ and Sophie went back to the cars.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>Dan shivered as they started making their way back down the winding path. <i><b>&ldquo;Here take this.</b></i>&rdquo; Phil said as he draped his jacket that he was carrying over Dan&rsquo;s shoulders.&rdquo;</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo;</b></i> he said burying his nose into it and taking a whiff of comfort and Phil.</p><p>They could see before they reached the cars that both their friends had obviously abandoned them earlier as they were huddled together sitting on the hood of Phil&rsquo;s rental car.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Where did you guys go? We looked all over for you,</b></i>&rdquo; Phil yelled angrily.</p><p>Shocked, PJ tried defending himself, &ldquo;<b><i>Sorry, Soph thought she saw something and got scared. We couldn&rsquo;t find you guys so we figured you had come out to the car without telling us.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no ex-&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>He was cut off by Sophie, <b><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry. It happened so fast and all I could think about was getting out of there,&rdquo; </i></b>she admitted. &ldquo;<i><b>Oh god Dan did something happen? You look shaken.&rdquo;</b></i> She wrapped her arms around him bringing him in for a hug. He stayed limp as she hugged him.</p><p>Phil grunted as he took hold of Dan&rsquo;s arm, <i><b>&ldquo;Listen I&rsquo;m sorry guys we can go over footage and stuff later. We&rsquo;re both pretty shaken up and need to get home.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>They said goodbye to each other with the promise that sometime over the next few days they would get together and go over and footage that they had.</p><p>The ride home was as silent has it had been on the way there. Neither of them said anything until they were safely back in their apartment.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Listen, Dan, I feel so bad,&rdquo; </b></i>Phil said rubbing the back of his neck.</p><p>He was a little more calmed down then he was before so he leaned in and placed a chaste kiss on Phil&rsquo;s lips. Pulling back. <i><b>&ldquo;Phil I already told you it&rsquo;s not your fault. That place was just creepy as hell,&rdquo;</b></i> he tried to smile. <i><b>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t explain anything that happened tonight, but I do know that none of it&rsquo;s your fault.</b></i></p><p>Phil still didn&rsquo;t look convinced but after a few minutes he spoke, <b><i>&ldquo;Do you want me to make some hot chocolate and maybe we could snuggle on the couch and watch a disney movie?&rdquo; </i></b>he asked hopefully.</p><p>He smiled, <i><b>&ldquo;Of course. Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>A smile appeared on Phil&rsquo;s face. He took Dan&rsquo;s hand and lead the way up the kitchen to get their drinks.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Remember you&rsquo;re still the one editing the footage,&rdquo; </b></i>Dan teased him.</p><p>Phil chuckled. Some weird things happened tonight but it would most certainly make for a great video.</p>",

Dan watched the young man from the shadows of the alleyway. Sweat dripping down his face and heart pumping with adrenaline. No matter how many times he did this the initial feeling of fear was always there. But it was something that had to be done. It just had to be.</p><p>The man was clearly drunk and stumbling around on the sidewalk. Dan looked around making sure that the streets were completely empty before he reached out from the darkness of the shadowy alleyway and pulled the young man into its depths.</p><p><i><b>\u201cHey! Wh-at are you doing?\u201d</b></i> the man slurred, trying to pull out of his grasp.</p><p>Having been through this already multiple times he didn&rsquo;t answer instead he stuck the needle he was holding in the man&rsquo;s neck.</p><p>The hardest part of this was dragging the heavy body back to his car and then getting it up the stairs to his apartment so no one saw. Luckily for him, the neighbor on his left was an older grandma who was deaf and was most likely asleep at this time of night and the neighbor on his right was never home anyway.</p><p>After he determined the coast was clear he dragged the man&rsquo;s body from his car up the stairs to his flat. He wheezed after the third flight of stairs, mentally cursing himself for living on the six floor.</p><p>By the time he made it to his front door, he was out of breath and sweating profusely. As quickly as he could, he unlocked his door and drug the unconscious man through into his apartment.</p><p>He had to work fast as the sedative he used only lasted around an hour. He had learned his lesson the hard way. On his first \u201couting\u201d as he liked to call them he had not set up his lab before getting the victim and while he set up the man had woken up and tried to run. He ended up having to kill that one without getting the part he needed. So he now set up everything before he went out to retrieve the person with the part he needed.</p><p>He had difficulty getting this one onto the table he hadn\u2019t really noticed before that the man was much larger than his other victims. But finally, he let out a breath as he got the man up on the table. Securing the last of the straps he let out a little cheer of victory. Since the man was not awake yet he decided he wanted to go visit Phil.</p><p>He opened the door the bedroom right off where he had his lab set up and stepped inside. The air was cold and it was dark as he made his way over to the bed. Phil was just as he had been when he had left him earlier laying peaceful in his bed.</p><p><i><b>\u201cHey love how are you doing?\u201d</b></i> Dan brushed a piece of hair out of his eyes. He knew Phil wouldn\u2019t answer him but a smile crept on his face knowing that soon that wouldn\u2019t be a problem.</p><p><i><b>\u201cThis is it Philly, the last piece to the puzzle. Soon we will be together again,\u201d</b></i> he giggled giving him a kiss on the forehead.</p><p>Two months ago when Dan had lost his boyfriend Phil in a car accident he had been utterly distraught and devastated. No matter who tried to cheer him up he was just inconsolable. He couldn&rsquo;t imagine life without Phil; they had been best friends since they were little and boyfriends for the past ten years. Phil was everything he had and the only thing he ever knew.</p><p>The depression had gotten so bad he\u2019d made a plan to jump off the bridge in the middle of town to end his life so he could be with Phil again. But something big that happened at work had stopped him.</p><p>Dan worked in a lab where they tested knew serums and stuff on animals and the latest serum that his company had been working on was the resurrection serum. No one aside from a few actually believed this serum would ever really work. But that all changed one night when one of their rat test subjects died. His colleges decided why not try the latest version on the rat, the college had figured it couldn\u2019t do any harm. And it didn\u2019t do any harm, in fact, the rat sprung back to life running around its cage like it just hadn\u2019t been laying there lifeless a moment ago. And that\u2019s when his plan had started to form.</p><p>Since Phil had died in a car accident normally it wouldn\u2019t have been a problem but after his death, he learned that Phil being the big generous oaf he was had decided to donate all his organs to people who needed them. Dan had pleaded with hospital staff claiming it went against their religious beliefs but they told him since Phil had signed the card there was nothing he could do.</p><p>At first, he had been heartbroken feeling like he had lost Phil all over again when he had an idea that just might work. So that is why for the last month he has been kidnapping and luring people to their apartment so he could harvest their organs to give to Phil. And tonight was the final organ, the heart. He was going to take this man&rsquo;s beating heart out of his chest and put it in Phil\u2019s and inject him with the serum. If everything went according to plan he would very shortly be reunited with the love of his life.</p><p>He heard a low moan coming from the adjoining room the man must be waking up which means it was time for Dan to get to work. He took one last look a Phil who, if Dan didn\u2019t know any better, would have looked like he was sleeping peacefully.<i><b> \u201cSoon my love,</b></i>\u201d he whispered before he exited the room.</p><p>By the time Dan reached the man, he was struggling with the metal clamps on his arms screaming, <b><i>\u201cHelp! Can anyone hear me!\u201d</i></b></p><p><i><b>\u201cWill you shut the fuck up!\u201d</b></i> he snapped pulling a towel from the counter next to the table and shoving it in the man\u2019s mouth.</p><p>Dan could tell the man was full on sobbing now tears running freely down his face.</p><p>Dan couldn\u2019t say he didn\u2019t feel bad about doing this to these people because he did, but he would do anything so he could be with Phil again.</p><p>Dan checked his tools over one more time making sure everything was in order before he turned back to the man who was still struggling against his restraints.</p><p><i><b>\u201cOk listen closely, you got that,\u201d</b></i> he said sternly to the man.</p><p>The man didn\u2019t show any acknowledgment he had heard just struggling harder to get free.</p><p>Dan sighed, <b><i>\u201cIn a moment I am going to remove the gag from your mouth. You are going to stay quiet and not scream, ok?\u201d</i></b></p><p>Tears still falling down his face the man hardly nodded his head.</p><p><b><i>\u201cOk when I remove the gag you can tell me any last words you have or anything like that.\u201d </i></b>he stopped his hand&rsquo;s inches from the gag. <i><b>\u201cRemember don\u2019t scream.\u201d </b></i>he glared down at the man.</p><p>The man started coughing when Dan pulled the gag out of his mouth,<b><i> \u201cPlease don\u2019t do this I have a family,\u201d</i></b> he tried pleading. His voice came out husky and funny sounding and if this wasn\u2019t such an important night it would have made Dan laugh.</p><p><b><i>\u201cAre there any last words you have before we do this?\u201d</i></b> he questioned completely ignore the man&rsquo;s plea.</p><p><b><i>\u201cI have money you can have it all just let me go,\u201d</i></b> the man pleaded for his life again.</p><p>He hated this, the pleading made it all so much worse. He took a moment and closed his eyes mentally preparing himself for what he had to do.</p><p><i><b>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this,\u201d </b></i>the man whispered.</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes snapped open and violently shoved the gag back into the mouth of the now screaming man again. <i><b>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand I do have to do this!\u201d</b></i> he screamed.</p><p><b><i>\u201cDo you think I want to kidnap people and kill them while I harvested their organs?! Well, I don\u2019t!\u201d</i></b></p><p>He was silent for a moment, then in a whisper he said, <b><i>\u201cI have to do this, I need Phil back.\u201d</i></b></p><p>He ignored the choked sounds coming from the man beneath him as he began his work. Cutting him open while he was still alive to ensure the heart would still be good and beating for when he put it into Phil.</p><p>All and all the procedure didn\u2019t take long and soon he was holding the man&rsquo;s heart in his hands. He whipped the sweat off his forehead with his now bloody hand smiling proudly. \u201cI did it, Phil, soon we&rsquo;ll be together again,\u201d he said joyously. He chuckled and turned back towards Phil\u2019s room ignoring the now dead, bloody dissected body of the man on the table behind him.</p><p>As quickly as he could he ran into Phil\u2019s room and shoved the heart into the already cut open chest. His fingers tingled with excitement and anticipation as he tried to carefully sew the wound shut on Phil\u2019s chest. The wound would definitely scar as he had to cut deep enough to access the parts of Phil\u2019s body where his organs go. He started sewing at the bottom of his torso carefully making his way him to his collarbone where the wound ended.</p><p>Once he was complete he took a step back taking a minute to admire his work. The wound was sewed together pretty well; it went jagged a tad in the middle because his hands had been shaking so bad but overall it looked good.</p><p>Hands still trembling he took the vial of serum and needle out of his pocket. With one last deep breath, he filled the syringe and injected the needle into Phil\u2019s skin. All in one shot he pushed the dark blue liquid into his arm. Almost instantly Phil started thrashing on the bed making these horrific moaning sounds. Startled he dropped the needle onto the floor. What was happening? This hadn\u2019t happened to the rat in the lab.</p><p>Placing his hands on Phil\u2019s shoulders he pinned Phil to the bed, <b><i>\u201cPhil?! Phil?!\u201d</i></b> he screamed hoping to shake the man out of his current state. But instead, Phil\u2019s eyes shoot open and he stopped seizing, Dan jumped back and screamed. Phil\u2019s eyes that had been a beautiful shade of blue before where now void of all colors but black. <i><b>\u201cPhil?\u201d</b></i> he whispered, shrinking back into the corner of the room.</p><p>Phil stood up and stumbled towards him still making the hellish moaning sounds he had been making before.</p><p>Gathering all his courage he took a step forward,<i><b> \u201cPhilly it\u2019s me, Dan, your boyfriend. Don\u2019t you recognize me?\u201d</b></i> he squeak as he realized no recognition showed in Phil\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Phil continued to slowly make his way across the room towards him, stumbling every few feet and almost falling over each time. Dan sunk to the floor hugging his knees to his chest. This isn\u2019t supposed to be how it happens he cried silently to himself tears falling down his face.</p><p>Phil was within a few feet of him now, <i><b>\u201cPhil please,\u201d</b></i> he begged hoping to spark some sort of recognition in his boyfriend. But instead of any sort of recognition, Phil let out a blood-curdling scream as he bent down picking Dan up by his throat.</p><p>His oxygen supply was cut off immediately, in fact, it felt like his throat was being crushed as well as not being able to breathe.</p><p>Dan was lifted off the floor his feet, now dangling a good fifteen inches from the ground. His hands flew to his throat trying to pry Phil\u2019s hands off. But it was useless, Phil was just too strong and after several moments he lost the energy to fight anymore. His hands dropped to his side and his throat relaxed not fighting the lack of oxygen. He vision started to blur fast and peacefulness started to wash over him. He may not have succeeded in bringing the love of his life back but he was at peace knowing that in one way or another they would soon be reunited forever.</p><p><i>\u201cWe bring you breaking news out of London tonight. A man identified as twenty-seven-year-old Daniel James Howell from Wokingham, England has been killed by his boyfriend Philip Michael Lester who was thought to have died in a car accident two months ago. It appears Howell and Lester have been responsible for the recent string of kidnappings and murders in the area over the last few months. Police are unsure exactly what happened tonight to cause Lester to lash out and kill Howell. But what is known is Howell has been wanted by the police for the last month in connection to a theft from a government facility where he was working. When police arrived on scene Lester had reportedly already taken his own life possibly due to guilt over killing his lover. \u00a0Police describe the crime scene as a bloodbath and bystanders said it was difficult to watch the bodies being bought out. We have been told that Lester and Howell had been keeping the bodies of their victims in their refrigerator reportedly having cut them up so they would all fit.</i></p><p><i>No one\u2019s sure what spurred Howell and Lester to go off on this gruesome killing spree but this crime will be remembered as one of the worst crimes in British history.</i></p><p><i>This is Katie Stein coming from downtown London BBC news.\u201d</i></p>",

As quickly as he could, he unlocked his door and drug the unconscious man through into his apartment.</p><p>He had to work fast as the sedative he used only lasted around an hour. He had learned his lesson the hard way. On his first \u201couting\u201d as he liked to call them he had not set up his lab before getting the victim and while he set up the man had woken up and tried to run. He ended up having to kill that one without getting the part he needed. So he now set up everything before he went out to retrieve the person with the part he needed.</p><p>He had difficulty getting this one onto the table he hadn\u2019t really noticed before that the man was much larger than his other victims. But finally, he let out a breath as he got the man up on the table. Securing the last of the straps he let out a little cheer of victory. Since the man was not awake yet he decided he wanted to go visit Phil.</p><p>He opened the door the bedroom right off where he had his lab set up and stepped inside. The air was cold and it was dark as he made his way over to the bed. Phil was just as he had been when he had left him earlier laying peaceful in his bed.</p><p><i><b>\u201cHey love how are you doing?\u201d</b></i> Dan brushed a piece of hair out of his eyes. He knew Phil wouldn\u2019t answer him but a smile crept on his face knowing that soon that wouldn\u2019t be a problem.</p><p><i><b>\u201cThis is it Philly, the last piece to the puzzle.

No matter who tried to cheer him up he was just inconsolable. He couldn\u2019t imagine life without Phil; they had been best friends since they were little and boyfriends for the past ten years. Phil was everything he had and the only thing he ever knew.</p><p>The depression had gotten so bad he\u2019d made a plan to jump off the bridge in the middle of town to end his life so he could be with Phil again. But something big that happened at work had stopped him.</p><p>Dan worked in a lab where they tested knew serums and stuff on animals and the latest serum that his company had been working on was the resurrection serum. No one aside from a few actually believed this serum would ever really work. But that all changed one night when one of their rat test subjects died. His colleges decided why not try the latest version on the rat, the college had figured it couldn\u2019t do any harm. And it didn\u2019t do any harm, in fact, the rat sprung back to life running around its cage like it just hadn\u2019t been laying there lifeless a moment ago. And that\u2019s when his plan had started to form.</p><p>Since Phil had died in a car accident normally it wouldn\u2019t have been a problem but after his death, he learned that Phil being the big generous oaf he was had decided to donate all his organs to people who needed them. Dan had pleaded with hospital staff claiming it went against their religious beliefs but they told him since Phil had signed the card there was nothing he could do.</p><p>At first, he had been heartbroken feeling like he had lost Phil all over again when he had an idea that just might work. So that is why for the last month he has been kidnapping and luring people to their apartment so he could harvest their organs to give to Phil. And tonight was the final organ, the heart. He was going to take this man\u2019s beating heart out of his chest and put it in Phil\u2019s and inject him with the serum. If everything went according to plan he would very shortly be reunited with the love of his life.</p><p>He heard a low moan coming from the adjoining room the man must be waking up which means it was time for Dan to get to work. He took one last look a Phil who, if Dan didn\u2019t know any better, would have looked like he was sleeping peacefully.<i><b> \u201cSoon my love,</b></i>\u201d he whispered before he exited the room.</p><p>By the time Dan reached the man, he was struggling with the metal clamps on his arms screaming, <b><i>\u201cHelp! Can anyone hear me!\u201d</i></b></p><p><i><b>\u201cWill you shut the fuck up!\u201d</b></i> he snapped pulling a towel from the counter next to the table and shoving it in the man\u2019s mouth.</p><p>Dan could tell the man was full on sobbing now tears running freely down his face.</p><p>Dan couldn\u2019t say he didn\u2019t feel bad about doing this to these people because he did, but he would do anything so he could be with Phil again.</p><p>Dan checked his tools over one more time making sure everything was in order before he turned back to the man who was still struggling against his restraints.</p><p><i><b>\u201cOk listen closely, you got that,\u201d</b></i> he said sternly to the man.</p><p>The man didn\u2019t show any acknowledgment he had heard just struggling harder to get free.</p><p>Dan sighed, <b><i>\u201cIn a moment I am going to remove the gag from your mouth. You are going to stay quiet and not scream, ok?\u201d</i></b></p><p>Tears still falling down his face the man hardly nodded his head.</p><p><b><i>\u201cOk when I remove the gag you can tell me any last words you have or anything like that.\u201d </i></b>he stopped his hand\u2019s inches from the gag. <i><b>\u201cRemember don\u2019t scream.\u201d </b></i>he glared down at the man.</p><p>The man started coughing when Dan pulled the gag out of his mouth,<b><i> \u201cPlease don\u2019t do this I have a family,\u201d</i></b> he tried pleading. His voice came out husky and funny sounding and if this wasn\u2019t such an important night it would have made Dan laugh.</p><p><b><i>\u201cAre there any last words you have before we do this?\u201d</i></b> he questioned completely ignore the man\u2019s plea.</p><p><b><i>\u201cI have money you can have it all just let me go,\u201d</i></b> the man pleaded for his life again.</p><p>He hated this, the pleading made it all so much worse. He took a moment and closed his eyes mentally preparing himself for what he had to do.</p><p><i><b>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this,\u201d </b></i>the man whispered.</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes snapped open and violently shoved the gag back into the mouth of the now screaming man again. <i><b>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand I do have to do this!\u201d</b></i> he screamed.</p><p><b><i>\u201cDo you think I want to kidnap people and kill them while I harvested their organs?! Well, I don\u2019t!\u201d</i></b></p><p>He was silent for a moment, then in a whisper he said, <b><i>\u201cI have to do this, I need Phil back.\u201d</i></b></p><p>He ignored the choked sounds coming from the man beneath him as he began his work. Cutting him open while he was still alive to ensure the heart would still be good and beating for when he put it into Phil.</p><p>All and all the procedure didn\u2019t take long and soon he was holding the man\u2019s heart in his hands. He whipped the sweat off his forehead with his now bloody hand smiling proudly. \u201cI did it, Phil, soon we\u2019ll be together again,\u201d he said joyously. He chuckled and turned back towards Phil\u2019s room ignoring the now dead, bloody dissected body of the man on the table behind him.</p><p>As quickly as he could he ran into Phil\u2019s room and shoved the heart into the already cut open chest. His fingers tingled with excitement and anticipation as he tried to carefully sew the wound shut on Phil\u2019s chest. The wound would definitely scar as he had to cut deep enough to access the parts of Phil\u2019s body where his organs go. He started sewing at the bottom of his torso carefully making his way him to his collarbone where the wound ended.</p><p>Once he was complete he took a step back taking a minute to admire his work. The wound was sewed together pretty well; it went jagged a tad in the middle because his hands had been shaking so bad but overall it looked good.</p><p>Hands still trembling he took the vial of serum and needle out of his pocket. With one last deep breath, he filled the syringe and injected the needle into Phil\u2019s skin. All in one shot he pushed the dark blue liquid into his arm. Almost instantly Phil started thrashing on the bed making these horrific moaning sounds. Startled he dropped the needle onto the floor. What was happening? This hadn\u2019t happened to the rat in the lab.</p><p>Placing his hands on Phil\u2019s shoulders he pinned Phil to the bed, <b><i>\u201cPhil?! Phil?!\u201d</i></b> he screamed hoping to shake the man out of his current state. But instead, Phil\u2019s eyes shoot open and he stopped seizing, Dan jumped back and screamed. Phil\u2019s eyes that had been a beautiful shade of blue before where now void of all colors but black. <i><b>\u201cPhil?\u201d</b></i> he whispered, shrinking back into the corner of the room.</p><p>Phil stood up and stumbled towards him still making the hellish moaning sounds he had been making before.</p><p>Gathering all his courage he took a step forward,<i><b> \u201cPhilly it\u2019s me, Dan, your boyfriend. Don\u2019t you recognize me?\u201d</b></i> he squeak as he realized no recognition showed in Phil\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Phil continued to slowly make his way across the room towards him, stumbling every few feet and almost falling over each time. Dan sunk to the floor hugging his knees to his chest. This isn\u2019t supposed to be how it happens he cried silently to himself tears falling down his face.</p><p>Phil was within a few feet of him now, <i><b>\u201cPhil please,\u201d</b></i> he begged hoping to spark some sort of recognition in his boyfriend. But instead of any sort of recognition, Phil let out a blood-curdling scream as he bent down picking Dan up by his throat.</p><p>His oxygen supply was cut off immediately, in fact, it felt like his throat was being crushed as well as not being able to breathe.</p><p>Dan was lifted off the floor his feet, now dangling a good fifteen inches from the ground. His hands flew to his throat trying to pry Phil\u2019s hands off. But it was useless, Phil was just too strong and after several moments he lost the energy to fight anymore. His hands dropped to his side and his throat relaxed not fighting the lack of oxygen. He vision started to blur fast and peacefulness started to wash over him. He may not have succeeded in bringing the love of his life back but he was at peace knowing that in one way or another they would soon be reunited forever.</p><p><i>\u201cWe bring you breaking news out of London tonight. A man identified as twenty-seven-year-old Daniel James Howell from Wokingham, England has been killed by his boyfriend Philip Michael Lester who was thought to have died in a car accident two months ago. It appears Howell and Lester have been responsible for the recent string of kidnappings and murders in the area over the last few months. Police are unsure exactly what happened tonight to cause Lester to lash out and kill Howell. But what is known is Howell has been wanted by the police for the last month in connection to a theft from a government facility where he was working. When police arrived on scene Lester had reportedly already taken his own life possibly due to guilt over killing his lover. \u00a0Police describe the crime scene as a bloodbath and bystanders said it was difficult to watch the bodies being bought out. We have been told that Lester and Howell had been keeping the bodies of their victims in their refrigerator reportedly having cut them up so they would all fit.</i></p><p><i>No one\u2019s sure what spurred Howell and Lester to go off on this gruesome killing spree but this crime will be remembered as one of the worst crimes in British history.</i></p><p><i>This is Katie Stein coming from downtown London BBC news.\u201d</i></p>",

He took a moment and closed his eyes mentally preparing himself for what he had to do.</p><p><i><b>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this,\u201d </b></i>the man whispered.</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes snapped open and violently shoved the gag back into the mouth of the now screaming man again. <i><b>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand I do have to do this!\u201d</b></i> he screamed.</p><p><b><i>\u201cDo you think I want to kidnap people and kill them while I harvested their organs?! Well, I don\u2019t!\u201d</i></b></p><p>He was silent for a moment, then in a whisper he said, <b><i>\u201cI have to do this, I need Phil back.\u201d</i></b></p><p>He ignored the choked sounds coming from the man beneath him as he began his work. Cutting him open while he was still alive to ensure the heart would still be good and beating for when he put it into Phil.</p><p>All and all the procedure didn\u2019t take long and soon he was holding the man\u2019s heart in his hands. He whipped the sweat off his forehead with his now bloody hand smiling proudly. \u201cI did it, Phil, soon we\u2019ll be together again,\u201d he said joyously. He chuckled and turned back towards Phil\u2019s room ignoring the now dead, bloody dissected body of the man on the table behind him.</p><p>As quickly as he could he ran into Phil\u2019s room and shoved the heart into the already cut open chest. His fingers tingled with excitement and anticipation as he tried to carefully sew the wound shut on Phil\u2019s chest. The wound would definitely scar as he had to cut deep enough to access the parts of Phil\u2019s body where his organs go. He started sewing at the bottom of his torso carefully making his way him to his collarbone where the wound ended.</p><p>Once he was complete he took a step back taking a minute to admire his work. The wound was sewed together pretty well; it went jagged a tad in the middle because his hands had been shaking so bad but overall it looked good.</p><p>Hands still trembling he took the vial of serum and needle out of his pocket. With one last deep breath, he filled the syringe and injected the needle into Phil\u2019s skin. All in one shot he pushed the dark blue liquid into his arm. Almost instantly Phil started thrashing on the bed making these horrific moaning sounds. Startled he dropped the needle onto the floor. What was happening? This hadn\u2019t happened to the rat in the lab.</p><p>Placing his hands on Phil\u2019s shoulders he pinned Phil to the bed, <b><i>\u201cPhil?! Phil?!\u201d</i></b> he screamed hoping to shake the man out of his current state. But instead, Phil\u2019s eyes shoot open and he stopped seizing, Dan jumped back and screamed. Phil\u2019s eyes that had been a beautiful shade of blue before where now void of all colors but black. <i><b>\u201cPhil?\u201d</b></i> he whispered, shrinking back into the corner of the room.</p><p>Phil stood up and stumbled towards him still making the hellish moaning sounds he had been making before.</p><p>Gathering all his courage he took a step forward,<i><b> \u201cPhilly it\u2019s me, Dan, your boyfriend. Don\u2019t you recognize me?\u201d</b></i> he squeak as he realized no recognition showed in Phil\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Phil continued to slowly make his way across the room towards him, stumbling every few feet and almost falling over each time. Dan sunk to the floor hugging his knees to his chest. This isn\u2019t supposed to be how it happens he cried silently to himself tears falling down his face.</p><p>Phil was within a few feet of him now, <i><b>\u201cPhil please,\u201d</b></i> he begged hoping to spark some sort of recognition in his boyfriend. But instead of any sort of recognition, Phil let out a blood-curdling scream as he bent down picking Dan up by his throat.</p><p>His oxygen supply was cut off immediately, in fact, it felt like his throat was being crushed as well as not being able to breathe.</p><p>Dan was lifted off the floor his feet, now dangling a good fifteen inches from the ground. His hands flew to his throat trying to pry Phil\u2019s hands off. But it was useless, Phil was just too strong and after several moments he lost the energy to fight anymore. His hands dropped to his side and his throat relaxed not fighting the lack of oxygen. He vision started to blur fast and peacefulness started to wash over him. He may not have succeeded in bringing the love of his life back but he was at peace knowing that in one way or another they would soon be reunited forever.</p><p><i>\u201cWe bring you breaking news out of London tonight.

Sweat dripping down his face and heart pumping with adrenaline. No matter how many times he did this the initial feeling of fear was always there. But it was something that had to be done. It just had to be.</p><p>The man was clearly drunk and stumbling around on the sidewalk. Dan looked around making sure that the streets were completely empty before he reached out from the darkness of the shadowy alleyway and pulled the young man into its depths.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Hey! Wh-at are you doing?&rdquo;</b></i> the man slurred, trying to pull out of his grasp.</p><p>Having been through this already multiple times he didn&rsquo;t answer instead he stuck the needle he was holding in the man&rsquo;s neck.</p><p>The hardest part of this was dragging the heavy body back to his car and then getting it up the stairs to his apartment so no one saw. Luckily for him, the neighbor on his left was an older grandma who was deaf and was most likely asleep at this time of night and the neighbor on his right was never home anyway.</p><p>After he determined the coast was clear he dragged the man&rsquo;s body from his car up the stairs to his flat. He wheezed after the third flight of stairs, mentally cursing himself for living on the six floor.</p><p>By the time he made it to his front door, he was out of breath and sweating profusely. As quickly as he could, he unlocked his door and drug the unconscious man through into his apartment.</p><p>He had to work fast as the sedative he used only lasted around an hour. He had learned his lesson the hard way. On his first &ldquo;outing&rdquo; as he liked to call them he had not set up his lab before getting the victim and while he set up the man had woken up and tried to run. He ended up having to kill that one without getting the part he needed. So he now set up everything before he went out to retrieve the person with the part he needed.</p><p>He had difficulty getting this one onto the table he hadn&rsquo;t really noticed before that the man was much larger than his other victims. But finally, he let out a breath as he got the man up on the table. Securing the last of the straps he let out a little cheer of victory. Since the man was not awake yet he decided he wanted to go visit Phil.</p><p>He opened the door the bedroom right off where he had his lab set up and stepped inside. The air was cold and it was dark as he made his way over to the bed. Phil was just as he had been when he had left him earlier laying peaceful in his bed.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Hey love how are you doing?&rdquo;</b></i> Dan brushed a piece of hair out of his eyes. He knew Phil wouldn&rsquo;t answer him but a smile crept on his face knowing that soon that wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;This is it Philly, the last piece to the puzzle. Soon we will be together again,&rdquo;</b></i> he giggled giving him a kiss on the forehead.</p><p>Two months ago when Dan had lost his boyfriend Phil in a car accident he had been utterly distraught and devastated. No matter who tried to cheer him up he was just inconsolable. He couldn&rsquo;t imagine life without Phil; they had been best friends since they were little and boyfriends for the past ten years. Phil was everything he had and the only thing he ever knew.</p><p>The depression had gotten so bad he&rsquo;d made a plan to jump off the bridge in the middle of town to end his life so he could be with Phil again. But something big that happened at work had stopped him.</p><p>Dan worked in a lab where they tested knew serums and stuff on animals and the latest serum that his company had been working on was the resurrection serum. No one aside from a few actually believed this serum would ever really work. But that all changed one night when one of their rat test subjects died. His colleges decided why not try the latest version on the rat, the college had figured it couldn&rsquo;t do any harm. And it didn&rsquo;t do any harm, in fact, the rat sprung back to life running around its cage like it just hadn&rsquo;t been laying there lifeless a moment ago. And that&rsquo;s when his plan had started to form.</p><p>Since Phil had died in a car accident normally it wouldn&rsquo;t have been a problem but after his death, he learned that Phil being the big generous oaf he was had decided to donate all his organs to people who needed them. Dan had pleaded with hospital staff claiming it went against their religious beliefs but they told him since Phil had signed the card there was nothing he could do.</p><p>At first, he had been heartbroken feeling like he had lost Phil all over again when he had an idea that just might work. So that is why for the last month he has been kidnapping and luring people to their apartment so he could harvest their organs to give to Phil. And tonight was the final organ, the heart. He was going to take this man&rsquo;s beating heart out of his chest and put it in Phil&rsquo;s and inject him with the serum. If everything went according to plan he would very shortly be reunited with the love of his life.</p><p>He heard a low moan coming from the adjoining room the man must be waking up which means it was time for Dan to get to work. He took one last look a Phil who, if Dan didn&rsquo;t know any better, would have looked like he was sleeping peacefully.<i><b> &ldquo;Soon my love,</b></i>&rdquo; he whispered before he exited the room.</p><p>By the time Dan reached the man, he was struggling with the metal clamps on his arms screaming, <b><i>&ldquo;Help! Can anyone hear me!&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Will you shut the fuck up!&rdquo;</b></i> he snapped pulling a towel from the counter next to the table and shoving it in the man&rsquo;s mouth.</p><p>Dan could tell the man was full on sobbing now tears running freely down his face.</p><p>Dan couldn&rsquo;t say he didn&rsquo;t feel bad about doing this to these people because he did, but he would do anything so he could be with Phil again.</p><p>Dan checked his tools over one more time making sure everything was in order before he turned back to the man who was still struggling against his restraints.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Ok listen closely, you got that,&rdquo;</b></i> he said sternly to the man.</p><p>The man didn&rsquo;t show any acknowledgment he had heard just struggling harder to get free.</p><p>Dan sighed, <b><i>&ldquo;In a moment I am going to remove the gag from your mouth. You are going to stay quiet and not scream, ok?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>Tears still falling down his face the man hardly nodded his head.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Ok when I remove the gag you can tell me any last words you have or anything like that.&rdquo; </i></b>he stopped his hand&rsquo;s inches from the gag. <i><b>&ldquo;Remember don&rsquo;t scream.&rdquo; </b></i>he glared down at the man.</p><p>The man started coughing when Dan pulled the gag out of his mouth,<b><i> &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t do this I have a family,&rdquo;</i></b> he tried pleading. His voice came out husky and funny sounding and if this wasn&rsquo;t such an important night it would have made Dan laugh.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Are there any last words you have before we do this?&rdquo;</i></b> he questioned completely ignore the man&rsquo;s plea.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;I have money you can have it all just let me go,&rdquo;</i></b> the man pleaded for his life again.</p><p>He hated this, the pleading made it all so much worse.
