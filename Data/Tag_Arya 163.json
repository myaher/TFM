        "answer": "<p>Hey, nonnie!</p><p>I both agree and disagree on this. :)</p><p>Honestly I don\u2019t think Jon and Arya were ever alike or that their bond came down to them being similar people. In book canon, Jon and Arya share the Stark look (Jon looks like Ned and Arya looks like Lyanna) and I suppose you could argue Kit Harrington and Maisie Williams look more like each other than either of them looks like Sophie Turner but that\u2019s about it.\u00a0</p><p>What Jon and Arya really are is a Ned x Lyanna 2.0. And just like Ned and Lyanna, Jon and Arya aren\u2019t really similar in personality. Ned is quiet, introverted, even shy. He\u2019s the\u00a0\u201cstill waters run deep\u201d type of man. Whereas Lyanna is the extroverted, impulsive sister with a penchant for over-dramatic theatricality (her dressing up as the Knight of the Laughing Tree at the tourney, for example).\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0I\u2019d say Jon and Sansa have always been more alike in behavior, character and worldview. They\u2019re both introverts where Arya is an extrovert. They both dream of a domestic, quiet life where Arya dreams about adventure and finding out\u00a0\u201cwhat\u2019s West of Westeros\u201d. Jon is a conformist, just like Sansa, who can\u2019t conform to the standards of the time because he\u2019s a bastard while Arya could fit in pretty nicely in her society because she\u2019s the daughter of a great Lord but can\u2019t because her interests and desires push her to buck convention.\u00a0</p><p>Jon and Arya\u2019s bond comes from their acceptance and support for each other, not their similarities. The one thing they share is the feeling that they\u2019re both outcasts in the Stark family and in society. They are different but they acknowledge each other as individuals and give each other the acceptance that they feel others are denying them. It\u2019s no mistake that in the books Arya thinks Jon will recognize her and love her even when her other family members might not. Because the love that Jon and Arya feel for each other is not conditional on what conventional society expects from them.\u00a0That\u2019s a really special, beautiful bond.\u00a0</p><p>I have theorized in the past that Jon and Arya\u2019s relationship might be strained once they\u2019re reunited but I don\u2019t think that would be a permanent issue or that their bond will suffer dramatically. Both Jon and Arya have grown and developed apart for some time now so it would be silly to say that there won\u2019t be any changes to their relationship. Whenever Jon thinks of Arya he thinks of the little sister he remembers, the little girl he said good-bye to in Winterfell. But that little girl has grown now and has gone through harrowing experiences. Arya thinks of Jon as her big brother and her childhood companion but Jon has now been through being a man of the Night\u2019s Watch, Lord Commander and King in the North. He\u2019s not the same kid that left Winterfell either. They\u2019ll both have to get to know each other again and figure out what their relationship now as adults will be like.\u00a0</p><p>I\u2019ve already stated that in the absence of the political Jon theory, Arya might have some pretty big bones to pick with Jon over his decision to bend the knee and bring D*ny to Winterfell. On the other hand, I think Jon might take issue with Arya\u2019s revenge quest and her list. We\u2019ve already seen how he reacted to Sansa proposing to take Last Hearth and Karhold from Ned Umber and Alys Karstark.\u00a0</p><p>Wholesale revenge and cruelty are not things Jon prescribes to. He can be ruthless at times (his Wildling plot), use violence when he feels he needs to (the execution of Janos Slynt) but the type of violence that Arya has been engaged in I think will give him pause. That doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019ll reject her or stop loving her but I do think these traits will cause him concern and might result in them clashing. However, those strains will be temporary. Arya\u2019s entire journey has been leading her back to Winterfell, and most particularly to Jon. Whereas she might not care whether Sansa might be shocked by the list of people she wants to kill (although her insecure look back at Sansa when Bran mentioned the list is an indication that she does care), she most definitely will care what Jon thinks. I imagine that will lead her to reexamine her actions and her behavior and hopefully find a balance between the brilliant warrior and the empathetic, sweet girl she still is deep down.\u00a0</p><p>As for Sansa and Arya \u2026 I don\u2019t know about them being closer to each other than Jon and Arya but I do think they\u2019ll be closer than what we saw in season 7. That was the promise made at the end of the last season and probably the only saving grace of that whole Winterfell plot line. Also, considering the comments made by both Sophie and Maisie about Sansa and Arya making a good team, I think there\u2019s reason to hope that Arya and Sansa will finally come together as individuals, love and respect each other and fight for one another as a pack.\u00a0</p><p>I was also surprised that in the new teaser, Arya and Sansa share a look but Arya doesn\u2019t share one with Jon. I don\u2019t think we should infer much of anything regarding the Jon/Arya relationship from that because it\u2019s one of the big payoffs of the show so they\u2019d probably want to keep what happens between them pretty close to the vest but that look that Sansa and Arya share does give me hope that we\u2019ll have the healthy, beautiful sister bond we\u2019ve all been dreaming about from season 8 Sansa and Arya.\u00a0</p><p>Thanks for the ask, nonnie!</p>",

Arya&rsquo;s entire journey has been leading her back to Winterfell, and most particularly to Jon. Whereas she might not care whether Sansa might be shocked by the list of people she wants to kill (although her insecure look back at Sansa when Bran mentioned the list is an indication that she does care), she most definitely will care what Jon thinks. I imagine that will lead her to reexamine her actions and her behavior and hopefully find a balance between the brilliant warrior and the empathetic, sweet girl she still is deep down.&nbsp;</p><p>As for Sansa and Arya &hellip; I don&rsquo;t know about them being closer to each other than Jon and Arya but I do think they&rsquo;ll be closer than what we saw in season 7. That was the promise made at the end of the last season and probably the only saving grace of that whole Winterfell plot line. Also, considering the comments made by both Sophie and Maisie about Sansa and Arya making a good team, I think there&rsquo;s reason to hope that Arya and Sansa will finally come together as individuals, love and respect each other and fight for one another as a pack.&nbsp;</p><p>I was also surprised that in the new teaser, Arya and Sansa share a look but Arya doesn&rsquo;t share one with Jon. I don&rsquo;t think we should infer much of anything regarding the Jon/Arya relationship from that because it&rsquo;s one of the big payoffs of the show so they&rsquo;d probably want to keep what happens between them pretty close to the vest but that look that Sansa and Arya share does give me hope that we&rsquo;ll have the healthy, beautiful sister bond we&rsquo;ve all been dreaming about from season 8 Sansa and Arya.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks for the ask, nonnie!</p>",

So, does this mean the latest promo actually doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s going to die and that it has nothing to do with the outcome of the show? Now I am starting to think it really is more of a promo highlighting Jon&rsquo;s parentage and the Starks coming together to protect him.
