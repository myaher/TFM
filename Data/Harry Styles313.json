really, styles? you\u2019re a fucking man and you slap me? you\u2019re like a fucking woman!\u201d</p><p>i was about to attack him, my fist already in the air and ready for a good, hard punch, when liam and niall literally pulled us away from each other.</p><p>\u201cwhat the fuck is going on here?!\u201d niall shouted at both of us.</p><p>\u201che took my hoodie!\u201d louis accused.</p><p>\u201cfor the last time, i did not fucking take your fucking hoodie!\u201d</p><p>\u201cshut up!\u201d liam shouted, his voice overpowering ours. thank god our hotel was private and had no other customers or else we\u2019ll be damned.</p><p>liam took a deep breath before speaking again. \u201clouis, your hoodie is with me. you lent it to me when i was feeling cold in the plane the other day, remember? you could\u2019ve asked me first considering my room is closer to yours.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>louis was about to protest when liam stopped him from doing so, then he turned to me. \u201charry, why the hell did you slap louis? you could\u2019ve told him nicely that the hoodie wasn\u2019t with you.\u201d</p><p>i scoffed. \u201cyou think i didn\u2019t do that? he fucking blamed me for stealing his hoodie and accused me and made up this story that i wank to thoughts of him while wearing it!\u201d i scrunched my nose at the disgusting thought. 2012 harry would\u2019ve loved that thought, but not me. not anymore.</p><p>niall and liam looked at each other, obviously hopeless and stressed because of louis and i. i felt guilty, but it\u2019s not like it\u2019s my fault. louis always pushed me to my limit. mostly in a negative way, and i just fought for myself.</p><p>\u201cstay there and keep quiet,\u201d liam sternly told us before pulling niall just a few meters away from us. louis gave me a quick, hard stare before turning his back on me and crossed his arms. i scoffed surprisingly at his childish attitude and rolled my eyes, turning my back at him as well.</p><p>after like two minutes, liam and niall went to us again.</p><p>\u201cokay, this will be our last resort. i swear to god, if you two assholes still don\u2019t make up, we\u2019ll let management know about this,\u201d liam said, making louis snort and roll his eyes.</p><p>\u201cyeah, \u2018cause management always saves the fucking day. wuhoo!\u201d he said sarcastically, which i found oddly funny, but i kept my laugh to myself.</p><p>\u201cshut the fuck up, tommo,\u201d niall said and hit the back of his head. when i heard his cry of pain, i couldn\u2019t hold my laugh in any longer.</p><p>\u201cserves you right,\u201d i said, smirking and winking at him. i just chuckled when he flipped me off again.</p><p>\u201cokay, that\u2019s it. you ready, lads?\u201d liam asked the both of us, and he pulled louis towards me.</p><p>\u201cwhat the fuck\u2014\u201d i wasn\u2019t able to finish my sentence since liam and niall basically shoved us into my room and the next thing i heard was the loud slam of the door and the click of the lock.</p><p>great, they fucking locked us in.</p><p>\u201cwhat the hell?\u201d louis exclaimed, trying to pry the door open. \u201copen up, you fuckers!\u201d</p><p>\u201cshut the hell up and let them do what they want, it\u2019s not like we\u2019re going to win against them anyway,\u201d i remarked tiredly and laid on my bed. it\u2019s been a long day, and i just wanted it to end.</p><p>but seemed like louis didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201coy, styles. why are you just laying there?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cshut up, louis. if you want to get out of here, keep your fucking noisy mouth shut. that way we can make them think we\u2019re finally \u201cokay\u201d with each other,\u201d i said, making air quotes on the word \u2018okay\u2019.</p><p>louis, however, just rolled his eyes and i was surprised when he laid beside me. on my bed.</p><p>\u201cwhat the fuck are you doing?!\u201d i tried pushing him off, but for a small and thin lad, he was a fucking heavyweight.</p><p>\u201cshut the hell up,\u201d he said, mocking my voice. that\u2019s it. i\u2019ve had enough.</p><p>\u201cwhy the fuck are you doing this to me?\u201d i sat up on the bed and asked desperately.</p><p>\u201cdoing what?\u201d he looked up at me, confused when i started talking calmly but seriously.</p><p>\u201cthis. pushing my buttons and stuff,\u201d i sighed and ran my fingers through my hair.</p><p>louis didn\u2019t answer, just avoided my gaze. i rolled my eyes, realizing he won\u2019t give me an answer anytime soon, and stood up.</p><p>i was about to grab a water bottle from my mini-ref when i heard him speak.</p><p>it was soft, not like his usual angry voice, but i heard it clearly.</p><p>\u201cbecause i need to.\u201d</p><p>i frowned and sat beside him. \u201cwhat do you mean you need to?\u201d i needed answers, and now that he had spoken up, i wasn\u2019t going to stop until i got them all. \u201clouis. tell me. what do you mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cbecause i can\u2019t live like this anymore, harry! seeing you and not being able to be with you the way i want to is fucking killing me, that\u2019s why i resorted to just bullying you. because aside from the fact that it\u2019s what i\u2019m apparently best at, it\u2019s the only way i know i can still talk to you without making it look like i want you in all the best fucking ways possible!\u201d</p><p>i felt my throat go dry with his words.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cb-but..\u201d i looked down and played with my fingers instead of talking. i couldn\u2019t formulate my thoughts well, so he continued.</p><p>\u201ci\u2019m an asshole, i know that.\u201d he chuckled, but i can hear the pain in his voice. \u201cyou deserve to hate me. the whole world deserves to hate me. because i sure hate myself the most.\u201d i heard him sniffle. \u201cyou think i like acting this way? you know how much i hate hurting you, harry, but i think i was, and am, the one who hurt you the most. i\u2019ve told you lots of mean things, painful things, but now that i&rsquo;ve told you the truth, i just can&rsquo;t keep on living like this. i can&rsquo;t keep hurting you&hellip;&ldquo; louis was full-on crying now, and my heart just literally broke into pieces. i&rsquo;ve always hated seeing him cry.</p><p>i did what i had and wanted to do. i hugged him so tight, tears forming in my eyes from the overwhelming feeling i got the minute my skin touched his. that moment, i knew i missed him.</p><p>\u201cshh, it\u2019s all right, i\u2019m sorry i, uh, argued with you and stuff,\u201d i said softly while caressing his hair.\u00a0\u201cit\u2019s so not me, but i couldn\u2019t help it, i guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201ci understand, haz,\u201d louis chuckled, and i shuddered at the nickname. god knows how much i missed hearing that from his lips.</p><p>\u201clouis&hellip;\u201d i choked out, unable to stop the tears from falling.\u00a0\u201ci&hellip;\u201d i still don\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>my breath hitched when louis gently kissed the salty tears away from my cheeks and my eyes. he must\u2019ve heard that because he suddenly stopped and pulled away, his eyes widened with surprise and embarrassment.</p><p>\u201coh my god, i\u2019m sorry, i&mdash;\u201d i can\u2019t take it anymore. i cut him off by pressing my lips to his oh so gently, and i immediately closed my eyes tightly with the feeling. i really fucking missed this.</p><p>he seemed to be taken aback with my actions for a second, but he closed his eyes as well, gently cupped my face, and kissed me back softly.</p><p>it was a soft kissing of lips and no tongue, but my head and my heart were both literally on cloud nine. after a minute, though, i realized i needed more. so i pressed my lips on his harder and kissed him with all my heart, pouring out the unspoken love i\u2019ve had for him all these years.</p><p>we both smiled into the kiss, which was getting a bit salty because of our tears, but neither of us cared.</p><p>i felt him push me back on the bed slowly, and when he did, he climbed on top of me. blue eyes pierced through my soul, and suddenly i felt like 2011 harry all over again.</p><p>\u201ci love you, harry,\u201d louis whispered softly, his lips brushing against mine.\u00a0\u201ci always have. i\u2019m not scared anymore, i want to be with you, no matter what they say. i\u2019m happy with you.\u201d</p><p>more tears came streaming down my face as i gripped his shirt tightly.\u00a0\u201ci love you too, lou. always.\u201d he wiped my tear-stained cheeks before kissing me again.</p><p>i tugged at his shirt, signaling him to take it off, and he happily obliged. he did the same with mine, and went on kissing my neck slowly but hotly. i groaned, and bucked my hips, trying to meet my hard-on with his.</p><p>\u201clou&hellip;\u201d i breathed, slowly rutting my hips against his.\u00a0\u201cn-need you, please..\u201d</p><p>\u201cfuck, haz. you\u2019re fucking hard. because of me, yeah? you want me as bad as i want you, babe?\u201d louis said, standing up to remove his pants and boxers while staring at me intently. i felt my mouth water at the sight of his cock.</p><p>\u201clouis, please,\u201d i whined and made grabby hands at him. he was now standing right in front of me. \u201cwant you to fuck my mouth, <i>daddy</i>.\u201d i looked up at him, batting my eyelashes at him innocently.</p><p>louis cursed under his breath, and i knew he loved being called\u00a0\u2018daddy\u2019. he always loved manhandling me. not that i didn\u2019t. i loved it too.</p><p>he tapped my mouth gently with the tip of his cock.\u00a0\u201copen up, baby boy.\u201d i did, and he immediately put his big hard-on inside. we groaned at the same time.</p><p>\u201cfuck, your mouth is so warm and wet,\u201d he gritted his teeth and guided my head deeper, letting me take him all in. if there was one thing i\u2019m good at, it\u2019s definitely giving blowjobs. i have no gag reflex, that\u2019s why i\u2019m able to deepthroat well.</p><p>he groaned when i cupped his balls, sucked his length harder and bobbed my head up and down faster. louis was now a groaning mess above me, but it only made me take him harder, until i felt his cum shoot down my throat. i happily swallowed it all.</p><p>\u201cfuck me now, daddy, please..\u201d my throat was a bit sore, making a more raspy voice, but it seemed to turn louis on even more.</p><p>\u201clay back on the bed, love, and spread your legs,\u201d he ordered, and i followed. he\u00a0inserted two fingers in my mouth, which i gladly and maybe a bit too eagerly coated with my saliva.</p><p>he then inserted both of them at once in me, making me whimper and scrunch my face hard. &quot;daddy&hellip;&rdquo; i breathed heavily.</p><p>&ldquo;gotta prep you first a bit, baby boy, yeah? it&rsquo;s been a while,&rdquo; he softly said while scissoring his fingers in me. soon enough, i was open wide enough for him and my cock as hard as a fucking rock.</p><p>&ldquo;lou&hellip; daddy&hellip; please&hellip;&rdquo; i begged. i moaned loudly when i felt him rub the tip of his cock against my hole.</p><p>&ldquo;fuck, okay, babe,&rdquo; he nodded, understanding what i wanted him to do. i gasped so loud i almost choked when he finally entered me roughly.</p><p>&ldquo;harry, love, are you all right?&rdquo; he asked me worriedly. i smiled at him and kissed him hard instead of answering. i looked into his eyes lustfully and lovingly at the same time, and with my raspy voice, i said:</p><p>&ldquo;wreck me, daddy.&rdquo; </p><p>that was all he needed to hear, because soon enough, he was pounding into me. hard, deep and fast. just the way i like it.</p><p>&ldquo;uhh god, daddy.. f-feels so good..&rdquo; i panted, wrapping my legs around his waist and pulling him closer to me.</p><p>&ldquo;louis!!!&rdquo; i screamed when he hit my prostate. i was about to touch myself when louis slapped my hand away.</p><p>&ldquo;don&rsquo;t&hellip; ugh fuck,&rdquo; he grunted, thrusting harder and faster into me. &ldquo;want you to cum only with my cock, okay baby boy?&rdquo;</p><p>i nodded frantically, unable to speak while he fucked me so good, my eyes were practically rolling up to my head.</p><p>he lifted my hips up, his hands cupping my bum perfectly, and fucked me harder.</p><p>&ldquo;daddy!!!! g-gonna cum..&rdquo; i looked at him, eyes widened with lust, while i bit my swollen lip a little.</p><p>he groaned at how i looked at him, then i felt him fill me with his cum. i moaned at the warmth inside me, and came afterwards.</p><p>we both practically collapsed on the bed, him laying on top of me. we both panted and waited for a few minutes before speaking.</p><p>&ldquo;i mean what i said, haz,&rdquo; louis whispered in my ear lovingly. i closed my eyes at the sound of his voice. &ldquo;i really do love you. always in my heart, harry styles.&rdquo;</p><p>i felt like crying again, but i managed to hold it in. i hugged him instead, making him feel my heartbeat.</p><p>&ldquo;i love you too, boo. always in my heart.&rdquo;</p>",

it&rsquo;s been a while,&rdquo; he softly said while scissoring his fingers in me. soon enough, i was open wide enough for him and my cock as hard as a fucking rock.</p><p>&ldquo;lou&hellip; daddy&hellip; please&hellip;&rdquo; i begged. i moaned loudly when i felt him rub the tip of his cock against my hole.</p><p>&ldquo;fuck, okay, babe,&rdquo; he nodded, understanding what i wanted him to do. i gasped so loud i almost choked when he finally entered me roughly.</p><p>&ldquo;harry, love, are you all right?&rdquo; he asked me worriedly. i smiled at him and kissed him hard instead of answering. i looked into his eyes lustfully and lovingly at the same time, and with my raspy voice, i said:</p><p>&ldquo;wreck me, daddy.&rdquo; </p><p>that was all he needed to hear, because soon enough, he was pounding into me. hard, deep and fast. just the way i like it.</p><p>&ldquo;uhh god, daddy.. f-feels so good..&rdquo; i panted, wrapping my legs around his waist and pulling him closer to me.</p><p>&ldquo;louis!!!&rdquo; i screamed when he hit my prostate. i was about to touch myself when louis slapped my hand away.</p><p>&ldquo;don&rsquo;t&hellip; ugh fuck,&rdquo; he grunted, thrusting harder and faster into me. &ldquo;want you to cum only with my cock, okay baby boy?&rdquo;</p><p>i nodded frantically, unable to speak while he fucked me so good, my eyes were practically rolling up to my head.</p><p>he lifted my hips up, his hands cupping my bum perfectly, and fucked me harder.</p><p>&ldquo;daddy!!!! g-gonna cum..&rdquo; i looked at him, eyes widened with lust, while i bit my swollen lip a little.</p><p>he groaned at how i looked at him, then i felt him fill me with his cum. i moaned at the warmth inside me, and came afterwards.</p><p>we both practically collapsed on the bed, him laying on top of me. we both panted and waited for a few minutes before speaking.</p><p>&ldquo;i mean what i said, haz,&rdquo; louis whispered in my ear lovingly. i closed my eyes at the sound of his voice. &ldquo;i really do love you. always in my heart, harry styles.&rdquo;</p><p>i felt like crying again, but i managed to hold it in. i hugged him instead, making him feel my heartbeat.</p><p>&ldquo;i love you too, boo. always in my heart.&rdquo;</p></p>",
