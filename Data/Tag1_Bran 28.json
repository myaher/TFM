In Bran&rsquo;s case that exception was\nyou. Ever since he met you and your siblings all those years ago, the Stark had\ngrown more than fond of your company. You had been there for him through\neverything and had even saved his life when Walkers threatened to kill all of\nyou and somewhere along the way Bran had ended up falling in love with you. </p><p>However, after\nbecoming the three eyed raved he knew life as a human was over and that meant\nthe chance of being with you had fled. And even though he was supposed to be\ncompletely detached from desire, his thoughts wondered back to you more often\nthan he would ever admit. No matter how much he tried to ignore those feelings,\nthey only came back stronger every time he saw you. Even then, planning the\nstrategy for the upcoming war with a stern expression in your face and pure\ndetermination glancing in your eyes, Bran believed you were the most beautiful\nperson he had ever seen. </p><p>&ldquo;You\nneed to stay in the crypts, where you will be safe&rdquo; Jon&rsquo;s voice\ninterrupted his thoughts</p><p>&ldquo;We\nneed to lure him into the open before his army destroys us all&rdquo; he\nexplained calmly, knowing very well the immensity of the risk he was putting\nhimself into, as well as it being the only chance they had against the Night\nKing.</p><p>&ldquo;You\ncan&rsquo;t be seriously suggesting for us to use you as bait&rdquo; you exclaimed\nloudly, shock and worry cursing through your veins. It was bad enough that most\nof you were probably going to die in the war, you couldn&rsquo;t handle Bran being\none of them. He was the memory of the world, which made his survival essential.\nWanting to be honest, however, you\u2019d admit there was another reason you couldn&rsquo;t\nbear the thought of Bran being out there, a much more personal one. </p><p>For a while\nnow, the Stark boy had been plaguing your thoughts day and night and you deny\nthe fact that your heart almost skipped a beat every time he was nearby. Attempting\nand failing to ignore what that meant, you had finally accepted the truth. Your\nfeelings towards Bran had changed from those of friendship and likeness to the\none of love. </p><p>&ldquo;It\nneeds to be done&rdquo; Bran replied, keeping his calm like he always did those\ndays. Looking around, your eyes pleaded for anyone to come up with a better\nidea, anything that could prevent that crazy plan, but nothing came. </p><p>&ldquo;Very\nwell&rdquo; you said putting an incredible amount of effort into holding back\nyour emotions before making your way out of the room. As the door closed behind\nyou, you leaned back against the wall and let out a deep sight, trying not to\nlet the tears fall. You didn&rsquo;t know how much time passed until the door opened\nagain to reveal Bran.</p><p>&ldquo;You\nare afraid&rdquo; he noted, voice lacking any form of emotion</p><p>&ldquo;How\ncan I not be? This is suicide, Bran&rdquo; you exclaimed turning to look at him </p><p>&ldquo;I will\nnot die, I have been shown the future&rdquo; he said seeming unphased by your\noutburst</p><p>&ldquo;The rest of us have not. I cannot stand by and watch you\npractically surrender to the enemy just because a vision showed you <i>everything</i>&rdquo; you insisted somewhat\nsarcastically causing the ghost of a smile to appear on his face, the only sign\nof emotion you had detected on him in a long time.</p><p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t show me everything.

There are still things I don&rsquo;t\nunderstand&rdquo; he said </p><p>&ldquo;Like what?&rdquo; you shot back</p><p>&ldquo;You have believed in my visions and repeatedly risked your life so\nthat I could become what I am, why doubt me now?&rdquo; for the first time you\ncould see a hint of genuine curiosity in his eyes, mixed with something else\nyou couldn&rsquo;t quite place.</p><p>&ldquo;Because I love you, gods damn it&rdquo; you raised your voice,\nfinally allowing your thoughts to be openly expressed. It was something you had\nbeen keeping in for far too long and letting go felt liberating.</p><p>&ldquo;So did he&rdquo; Bran replied bringing you back to reality with his\ncold tone &ldquo;Bran Stark, I mean. He loved you with all his heart, but he is\nnot here anymore&rdquo; His voice remained calm as ever, but you noticed the\nlook on his eyes had shifted into one of hope and affection.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, he is. Bran, this <i>is</i>\nyou&rdquo; you exclaimed, kneeling down so that the two of you were on the same\nlevel and taking his hand in yours.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/n, this cannot happen&rdquo; he sighted feeling his own heart\nbreak just as the words left his lips &ldquo;I am the three eyed raven&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So what?&rdquo; you asked, too preoccupied by the fact that he had\nadmitted to return your feelings to let anything ruin that.</p><p>&ldquo;I am not supposed to want anymore. I can&rsquo;t give you a home or a\ntitle&rdquo; he explained and a traced of sadness could be clearly traced in his\nvoice. That had been what he wanted all along and now that it was finally\npossible he had to deny. He may love you, but he could not condemn you to his\nway of life.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any of this, I want you&rdquo; you insisted &ldquo;I\nknow you claim to live in the past, but it&rsquo;s time you looked around and saw the\npresent&rdquo;</p><p>He knew he shouldn&rsquo;t, but the way your hand seemed to fit perfectly into\nhis combined with the almost pleading look in your eyes were all it took to\nchange his mind. Cupping your face in his hand, he pulled you closed until your\nfaces were inches apart. Looking for any sign of doubt, he found none so he\nplaced his lips on your in a soft slow kiss. It was short lived and hesitant,\nbut it was all you needed to feel your heart swell with warmth. </p><p>And maybe you were getting into something more complicated than you\ncould fathom, but whatever it was, you were willing to go through it if it\nmeant having Bran by your side.</p>",

Should a king beloved by the smallfolk be set aside for two people with great destinies? Initially the answer would be yes. Think of how many fics and mets have been written about why Aegon doesn\u2019t deserve the throne but Jon and Daenerys do. That\u2019s 80% of all content about the character. Despite being presented as a solution to several problems, people want to see Aegon fail, they believe he hasn\u2019t \u2018earned\u2019 it or he simply doesn\u2019t deserve it. So GRRM will write it, and based on what we got on the show, it will horrify the readers because they\u2019ll be forced to read what entitlement and great destinies actually mean for the smallfolk.

Why should they be supported anymore than him?<br></p></blockquote><p>Exactly. Aegon isn\u2019t there to be a hero which is why they hate him. He is there to motivate the protagonists and pose important questions to the readers. Aegon is a decent king, he has flaws, he\u2019ll make mistakes but he is what Westeros needs. The question to the reader is should Daenerys and maybe Jon wage war against him because they and the readers believe they have a greater claim to the Iron Throne? Should a king beloved by the smallfolk be set aside for two people with great destinies? Initially the answer would be yes. Think of how many fics and mets have been written about why Aegon doesn\u2019t deserve the throne but Jon and Daenerys do. That\u2019s 80% of all content about the character. Despite being presented as a solution to several problems, people want to see Aegon fail, they believe he hasn\u2019t \u2018earned\u2019 it or he simply doesn\u2019t deserve it. So GRRM will write it, and based on what we got on the show, it will horrify the readers because they\u2019ll be forced to read what entitlement and great destinies actually mean for the smallfolk. It will expose the fact that kingship is more than just claims to the throne or military might, it\u2019s about serving the realm.\u00a0</p><p>This is why king Bran will work. In a way Bran will be similar to Aegon, only we would have spent more time seeing Bran sacrifice so much for the world. Bran won\u2019t take the throne because he has king\u2019s blood, it would be given to him because he represents <a href=\"https://sayruq.tumblr.com/post/185269235149/bran-stark-was-lord-of-winterfell-lord-of-the\" target=\"_blank\">all the tenets of the ideal king</a>.
