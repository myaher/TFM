Her casket was filled with flowers, ones they\u2019d all picked themselves from about the fields, but not a single one was as beautiful as her mom, even dead</li><li>After the funeral, beau stays with yeza and luke. She sends a terse letter explaining everything to xenoth, so he doesn\u2019t get her kicked out, and ignores every letter he sends back</li><li>Eventually, her sadness is overaken by anger. <i>Rage</i>, at the creatures that had killed her mother (had tortured her, she\u2019d seen the marks on her arms and legs, and painted across her neck)</li><li>So, she pays a group of crownsguard that look sufficiently competent, and storms a goblin camp</li><li>She can admit it\u2019s not her best plan, and that she nearly dies far too many times, but- but, it does give her something. Information. A purpose. There was a woman- not a goblin, but they never saw her face.</li><li>She was hired to make the halfling woman suffer.</li><li>Beau gets everything she can from the little cretins, and then throws them away</li><li>She sees the looks the crownsguard are giving her, and throws them more gold. They look away</li><li>She goes back to home, and tells yeza she has to leave</li><li>He knows <i>(always a fighter)</i></li><li>So she heads out</li><li>Does some adventuring on the side, to keep her pockets full (or full enough)</li><li>Meets a sly half orc and an overly optimistic tiefling and decides to stick with them, but doesn\u2019t forget what goal she\u2019s set out for herself</li><li>Meets the rest of them</li><li>Tries not to snarl when she sees nott</li><li>Gets to know her more, and it\u2019s easier to separate her from the monsters that tortured her mother.
