She looked through the illusion hiding the cart, watched and waited, and when Lorenzo turned his back she reached through the bars as well as she could with bound wrists and clutched her friend by the colorful robes that were becoming more scarlet by the moment.</p><p>The storm had been brewing for days. Small prayers, persistent hope, never failing faith. When she&rsquo;d been captured there had been not a cloud in the sky. She&rsquo;d been alone. </p><p>She was alone no longer. </p><p>The Stormlord did not take kindly to his followers being held captive, and between Him, Jester&rsquo;s mysterious Traveller (the tiefling was always whispering to someone in the nights, earning swift reprimands, and a green cloak had once flickered out of sight as they pushed through the verdant forests), and whatever old and ancient being that kept Fjord in its sights (and kept causing persistent saltwater rust to bloom across Fjord&rsquo;s cage, despite how many times he&rsquo;d been moved to new ones) she could feel the omens of things greater than mere mortals coming for what was theirs.</p><p>The storm swelled above, a promise of rescue. People were shouting and screaming and pleading. Nott had lept off the cage behind her and was running for relative safety,  Beau had lit Lorenzo on fire before doing the same. Her friends were recognizing a losing fight and retreating while they could.
