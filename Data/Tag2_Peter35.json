Barry was trying to help you get to Mach 2 under a few seconds and it was harder than it sounded. Training was a real pain in the legs mostly, but it helps.</p><p>\u201cYeah you can Y/N. I believe in you. Come on, just relax okay. Deep breaths-\u201d he says encouragingly, walking towards you, hands extended, pulling you into a hug, rubbing your back soothingly.</p><p>\u201cI know I need to do this, and I know that we need to be faster than Zoom but Barry it\u2019s hard.\u201d You grunted, feeling of hopelessness and a hint of fear settling in.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s okay, we\u2019re gonna be able to do this, okay? I believe in you Y/N, in us.\u201d Barry says as he pulls you closer and you instantly relax at the simple, loving action.</p><p>\u201cGuys we need you in the cortex now.\u201d Caitlyn\u2019s voice booms through the speakers, interrupting you both and alerting the two of you of the team meeting, with hopefully good news or any news regarding the other metas in the city.</p><p>\u201cRace ya there?\u201d Barry smirks, getting ready to run.</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re so on Flash.\u201d You chuckle, as you both run out of the speed lab, straight to the cortex.</p><p>Your relationship with Barry was kind of unusual. You weren\u2019t together but sometimes you both acted like you were? It was a sort of unspoken thing and you guess that the reason that neither of you questioned it or said anything is because, well the both of you didn\u2019t want things to go bad between each other. You were good friends, throughout all the bad stuff that had happened to you both, you were always there for each other. You loved Barry and Barry loved you. When the particle accelerator exploded, Barry and you had gotten your powers, the exact same powers. You were visiting him at his lab at CCPD when it had happened, woke up a few months later and your lives were forever changed. With the good, came the bad, arguments and disagreements with Barry were more often and it wasn\u2019t something either of you liked. But you both worked on it, communicating better, and things have been going well. It has been 3 years and your friendship were still strong, but now it was also a partnership, The Flash and Swift.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cBarry, Y/N, I need you both to take these with you, run somewhere and wait for our signal.\u201d Cisco says as we enter the cortex, handing us the tachyon devices.</p><p>Taking the identical devices from Cisco, Barry and you speed change into your suits and sped away, meeting at the Keystone City boarder. Coming to a stop, Barry gives you a nod and you both start to talk to everyone back at S.T.A.R Labs through the comms, waiting for the signal.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cOkay you guys, we\u2019re here, you got our location?\u201d Barry asks through his comms, awaiting a response from Cisco or even Caitlin, as you did too. You were excited to try the tachyon device out, it\u2019s supposed to be like this supercharge battery that well, charges the speed force in us.</p><p>Back at S.T.A.R Labs, Cisco asks us, \u201cYou good? You guys don\u2019t need to like stretch or somethin\u2019?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cNo no no we\u2019re good, Cisco.\u201d You answer, chuckling at your friend.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take this tachyon enhancer out for a test drive.\u201d Cisco says trying to sound cool, Caitlin and Iris standing closely behind him, not wanting to miss anything.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d You say as you turn to face Barry. His hands come up to cup your face, fingers lightly brushing your cheeks before he places a gentle kiss to your lips. Pulling away, he nods, gives you a reassuring smile and places the device on his chest, you mimic his actions, jumping a bit at the sudden reaction you feel your body have to it, you feel kind of jittery and well, nervous. You lick your lips and ball up your fists before squeezing your eyes shut as you mentally prepare for the outcome of this.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWhoo! Yeah!\u201d Barry exhales, feeling the device work.</p><p>You have the same reaction; it really does feel like your speed force cells are being supercharged. \u201cWoah, I feel that!\u201d You exhale.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cThat is the tachyon device, powering up the speed force in your cells like a quick charge battery.\u201d Caitlin says, sounding very chipper.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cHow do you guys feel?\u201d She asks.</p><p>\u201cUh, weird, but in a good way.\u201d You answer, feeling a rush of energy.</p><p>\u201cDifferent, really different.\u201d Barry says with a sweet smile plastered on his face. His excitement was quite evident.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see how long it takes for you to get back here, on my count\u2026\u201d Cisco says. That was the signal, well kind of, it was a count-down but same thing. You and Barry, got into position, waiting for that go.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYou ready Flash?\u201d You smirk at the handsome speedster next to you.</p><p>\u201c\u20263..2\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs ready as you are Swift.\u201d He grins, shooting you a rather flirty smirk.</p><p>\u201c..1..Go!\u201d Cisco says as starts watching the timer on the clock, waiting for Barry and you to return to the S.T.A.R Labs.</p><p>Barry and you run, much much faster than before.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cDang, this thing has them crusin\u2019\u2026\u201d Cisco says, honestly impressed by you guys speed.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cHow fast do they normally go?\u201d Iris asks, interested about this whole situation and kind of worried about you and Barry.</p><p>\u201cNot this fast.\u201d Caitlin says nonchalantly.</p><p>\u201cNot even close, are their vitals okay?\u201d Cisco asks as his eyes widen at how fast the two of you are running around, the city.</p><p>Looking at the screen, Caitlin is relieved and kind of impressed, \u201cYeah, they\u2019re perfect.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cCool, it\u2019s like having a pit stop attached to your chest.\u201d Iris says impressed.</p><p>\u201cGuys, I can go faster!\u201d You say as you ran throughout the city.</p><p>\u201cYeah, guys, me too!\u201d Barry says.</p><p>A grin appears on Cisco\u2019s face as he simply says, \u201cDo it.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Smiling to yourself you ran, faster that you\u2019ve ever ran before. Hell, probably faster than Barry has too, but you sort of ran so fast that you managed to travel to another Earth. You didn\u2019t know that at first, but you found out eventually.</p><p><br/></p><p>How did you find that out, well eventually from the guy dressed in a red and blue suit who you saved from a falling building indirectly told you so? After speaking to him for a few minutes you knew for a fact that he wasn\u2019t a meta from Central City.</p><p>You had spotted him the moment you came to a stop, scanning the area you, ran up the building, catching him swiftly, like your name sake and ran towards a field, although you didn\u2019t mean too.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on fire!\u201d the guy exclaims, through his mask as he tried to put the fire out.</p><p>\u201cYeah uh\u2026 sorry about that it happens sometimes, with the fiction of running at\u2026\u201d You say but the actions of the guy makes you stop for a moment, you look at him, his suit, head to toe and wonder, who is he and where did he get it, but he has something else to say, something extremely weird but not unbelievable.</p><p>\u201cYou sound like her.\u201d He says, taking a step back and removing his mask. You examined his face, but sadness clouded his features. He looked at you, but you had your mask on, your identity was still hidden, and it seemed to disappoint him.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cBy the way, I didn\u2019t need you to save me.\u201d He grimaced.</p><p>You were taken aback by that statement, confused. \u201cUh, yeah you did, you were falling out of a building, if I hadn\u2019t saved you would be splat.\u201d You say, crossing your arms.</p><p><br/></p><p>He shakes his head before putting his mask back on, \u201cI-uh have to get back to the city.\u201d He says, turning around and starts swinging in the air. Shooting webs out of his wrists, he moved like a spider. Like the symbol what was on his suit, it made sense.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWhat the hell\u2026that\u2019s a new one.\u201d You gape to yourself before you speed towards him. Stopping him at his tracks.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cHow did you do that?\u201d You ask the guy; you were so sure that this Central City maybe he was from Keystone? Maybe this was Keystone?</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI-uh\u2026I\u2019m Spider-Man.\u201d He says, puffing his chest out a bit, sounding a bit awkward.</p><p><br/></p><p>\n\ntags - <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSHRHLan5qR13csDWWNA0NQ\" target=\"_blank\">@xbabykookiix</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOpx2-TeUg7NS5UyVKX3sOg\" target=\"_blank\">@opportunitythemarsrover</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1MfzScq_8L0AhximwRM8wg\" target=\"_blank\">@kewl-r</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myMfiFhOI9m3VZ3_x7VPlyg\" target=\"_blank\">@crystallinestorms</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxGFvgPkB9COIZiUWcx9wTg\" target=\"_blank\">@seppys-return-to-madness</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mysGhZ6aEYr6aZ6eValSUOA\" target=\"_blank\">@mixed-fandoms-girl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ml3xHyjnjL2G7XNCPMzxzrg\" target=\"_blank\">@sunrisespidey</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9jjhUSEjAE34RgHiiTj0dw\" target=\"_blank\">@upsidedownparker</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWiuaNmZ_gvkS_Fehlkkteg\" target=\"_blank\">@vintagebeauty1496</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgJhwm1N8BcbixN_utZP-Vw\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a>@spideylovin</a>\u200b <a>@thatonekid520</a>\u200b <a>@oyasumayday</a>\u200b <a>@exo-talented-kings</a>\u200b <a>@bandsruinedmylife</a>\u200b @anterricchaos <a>@frustrated-ferret</a>\u200b <a>@the-story-of-the-tucks</a>\u200b <a>@marvelbisexualbean</a>\u200b @nicoleaustin619 <a>@bellaforever365</a>\u200b <a>@ximaginx</a>\u200b <a>@trashinaglass</a>\u200b <a>@hillsnholland</a>\u200b <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1LCDoB3Cx5dIAEwK1HO3Kg\" target=\"_blank\">@thescarletspeedsterbha</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEECr5hTjNL6PF-lYIV53sA\" target=\"_blank\">@onceuponateenpanwolfian</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mha4i3OjIkHQuWassQEsoeQ\" target=\"_blank\">@immagiftedturtle</a> @weirdperson04<br/></p>",

I believe in you. Come on, just relax okay. Deep breaths-\u201d he says encouragingly, walking towards you, hands extended, pulling you into a hug, rubbing your back soothingly.</p><p>\u201cI know I need to do this, and I know that we need to be faster than Zoom but Barry it\u2019s hard.\u201d You grunted, feeling of hopelessness and a hint of fear settling in.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s okay, we\u2019re gonna be able to do this, okay?

You weren\u2019t together but sometimes you both acted like you were? It was a sort of unspoken thing and you guess that the reason that neither of you questioned it or said anything is because, well the both of you didn\u2019t want things to go bad between each other. You were good friends, throughout all the bad stuff that had happened to you both, you were always there for each other. You loved Barry and Barry loved you. When the particle accelerator exploded, Barry and you had gotten your powers, the exact same powers. You were visiting him at his lab at CCPD when it had happened, woke up a few months later and your lives were forever changed. With the good, came the bad, arguments and disagreements with Barry were more often and it wasn\u2019t something either of you liked. But you both worked on it, communicating better, and things have been going well. It has been 3 years and your friendship were still strong, but now it was also a partnership, The Flash and Swift.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cBarry, Y/N, I need you both to take these with you, run somewhere and wait for our signal.\u201d Cisco says as we enter the cortex, handing us the tachyon devices.</p><p>Taking the identical devices from Cisco, Barry and you speed change into your suits and sped away, meeting at the Keystone City boarder. Coming to a stop, Barry gives you a nod and you both start to talk to everyone back at S.T.A.R Labs through the comms, waiting for the signal.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOkay you guys, we\u2019re here, you got our location?\u201d Barry asks through his comms, awaiting a response from Cisco or even Caitlin, as you did too. You were excited to try the tachyon device out, it\u2019s supposed to be like this supercharge battery that well, charges the speed force in us.</p><p>Back at S.T.A.R Labs, Cisco asks us, \u201cYou good? You guys don\u2019t need to like stretch or somethin\u2019?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cNo no no we\u2019re good, Cisco.\u201d You answer, chuckling at your friend.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take this tachyon enhancer out for a test drive.\u201d Cisco says trying to sound cool, Caitlin and Iris standing closely behind him, not wanting to miss anything.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d You say as you turn to face Barry. His hands come up to cup your face, fingers lightly brushing your cheeks before he places a gentle kiss to your lips. Pulling away, he nods, gives you a reassuring smile and places the device on his chest, you mimic his actions, jumping a bit at the sudden reaction you feel your body have to it, you feel kind of jittery and well, nervous. You lick your lips and ball up your fists before squeezing your eyes shut as you mentally prepare for the outcome of this.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhoo! Yeah!\u201d Barry exhales, feeling the device work.</p><p>You have the same reaction; it really does feel like your speed force cells are being supercharged. \u201cWoah, I feel that!\u201d You exhale.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThat is the tachyon device, powering up the speed force in your cells like a quick charge battery.\u201d Caitlin says, sounding very chipper.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHow do you guys feel?\u201d She asks.</p><p>\u201cUh, weird, but in a good way.\u201d You answer, feeling a rush of energy.</p><p>\u201cDifferent, really different.\u201d Barry says with a sweet smile plastered on his face. His excitement was quite evident.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see how long it takes for you to get back here, on my count\u2026\u201d Cisco says. That was the signal, well kind of, it was a count-down but same thing. You and Barry, got into position, waiting for that go.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou ready Flash?\u201d You smirk at the handsome speedster next to you.</p><p>\u201c\u20263..2\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs ready as you are Swift.\u201d He grins, shooting you a rather flirty smirk.</p><p>\u201c..1..Go!\u201d Cisco says as starts watching the timer on the clock, waiting for Barry and you to return to the S.T.A.R Labs.</p><p>Barry and you run, much much faster than before.<br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cDang, this thing has them crusin\u2019\u2026\u201d Cisco says, honestly impressed by you guys speed.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHow fast do they normally go?\u201d Iris asks, interested about this whole situation and kind of worried about you and Barry.</p><p>\u201cNot this fast.\u201d Caitlin says nonchalantly.</p><p>\u201cNot even close, are their vitals okay?\u201d Cisco asks as his eyes widen at how fast the two of you are running around, the city.</p><p>Looking at the screen, Caitlin is relieved and kind of impressed, \u201cYeah, they\u2019re perfect.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cCool, it\u2019s like having a pit stop attached to your chest.\u201d Iris says impressed.</p><p>\u201cGuys, I can go faster!\u201d You say as you ran throughout the city.</p><p>\u201cYeah, guys, me too!\u201d Barry says.</p><p>A grin appears on Cisco\u2019s face as he simply says, \u201cDo it.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Smiling to yourself you ran, faster that you\u2019ve ever ran before. Hell, probably faster than Barry has too, but you sort of ran so fast that you managed to travel to another Earth. You didn\u2019t know that at first, but you found out eventually.</p><p><br></p><p>How did you find that out, well eventually from the guy dressed in a red and blue suit who you saved from a falling building indirectly told you so? After speaking to him for a few minutes you knew for a fact that he wasn\u2019t a meta from Central City.</p><p>You had spotted him the moment you came to a stop, scanning the area you, ran up the building, catching him swiftly, like your name sake and ran towards a field, although you didn\u2019t mean too.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on fire!\u201d the guy exclaims, through his mask as he tried to put the fire out.</p><p>\u201cYeah uh\u2026 sorry about that it happens sometimes, with the fiction of running at\u2026\u201d You say but the actions of the guy makes you stop for a moment, you look at him, his suit, head to toe and wonder, who is he and where did he get it, but he has something else to say, something extremely weird but not unbelievable.</p><p>\u201cYou sound like her.\u201d He says, taking a step back and removing his mask. You examined his face, but sadness clouded his features. He looked at you, but you had your mask on, your identity was still hidden, and it seemed to disappoint him.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cBy the way, I didn\u2019t need you to save me.\u201d He grimaced.</p><p>You were taken aback by that statement, confused. \u201cUh, yeah you did, you were falling out of a building, if I hadn\u2019t saved you would be splat.\u201d You say, crossing your arms.</p><p><br></p><p>He shakes his head before putting his mask back on, \u201cI-uh have to get back to the city.\u201d He says, turning around and starts swinging in the air. Shooting webs out of his wrists, he moved like a spider. Like the symbol what was on his suit, it made sense.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhat the hell\u2026that\u2019s a new one.\u201d You gape to yourself before you speed towards him. Stopping him at his tracks.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHow did you do that?\u201d You ask the guy; you were so sure that this Central City maybe he was from Keystone? Maybe this was Keystone?</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI-uh\u2026I\u2019m Spider-Man.\u201d He says, puffing his chest out a bit, sounding a bit awkward.</p><p><br></p><p>\n\ntags - <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSHRHLan5qR13csDWWNA0NQ\" target=\"_blank\">@xbabykookiix</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOpx2-TeUg7NS5UyVKX3sOg\" target=\"_blank\">@opportunitythemarsrover</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1MfzScq_8L0AhximwRM8wg\" target=\"_blank\">@kewl-r</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myMfiFhOI9m3VZ3_x7VPlyg\" target=\"_blank\">@crystallinestorms</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxGFvgPkB9COIZiUWcx9wTg\" target=\"_blank\">@seppys-return-to-madness</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mysGhZ6aEYr6aZ6eValSUOA\" target=\"_blank\">@mixed-fandoms-girl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ml3xHyjnjL2G7XNCPMzxzrg\" target=\"_blank\">@sunrisespidey</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9jjhUSEjAE34RgHiiTj0dw\" target=\"_blank\">@upsidedownparker</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWiuaNmZ_gvkS_Fehlkkteg\" target=\"_blank\">@vintagebeauty1496</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgJhwm1N8BcbixN_utZP-Vw\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a>@spideylovin</a>\u200b <a>@thatonekid520</a>\u200b <a>@oyasumayday</a>\u200b <a>@exo-talented-kings</a>\u200b <a>@bandsruinedmylife</a>\u200b @anterricchaos <a>@frustrated-ferret</a>\u200b <a>@the-story-of-the-tucks</a>\u200b <a>@marvelbisexualbean</a>\u200b @nicoleaustin619 <a>@bellaforever365</a>\u200b <a>@ximaginx</a>\u200b <a>@trashinaglass</a>\u200b <a>@hillsnholland</a>\u200b <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1LCDoB3Cx5dIAEwK1HO3Kg\" target=\"_blank\">@thescarletspeedsterbha</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEECr5hTjNL6PF-lYIV53sA\" target=\"_blank\">@onceuponateenpanwolfian</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mha4i3OjIkHQuWassQEsoeQ\" target=\"_blank\">@immagiftedturtle</a> @weirdperson04<br></p>",

Barry was trying to help you get to Mach 2 under a few seconds and it was harder than it sounded. Training was a real pain in the legs mostly, but it helps.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah you can Y/N. I believe in you. Come on, just relax okay. Deep breaths-&rdquo; he says encouragingly, walking towards you, hands extended, pulling you into a hug, rubbing your back soothingly.</p><p>&ldquo;I know I need to do this, and I know that we need to be faster than Zoom but Barry it&rsquo;s hard.&rdquo; You grunted, feeling of hopelessness and a hint of fear settling in.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s okay, we&rsquo;re gonna be able to do this, okay? I believe in you Y/N, in us.&rdquo; Barry says as he pulls you closer and you instantly relax at the simple, loving action.</p><p>&ldquo;Guys we need you in the cortex now.&rdquo; Caitlyn&rsquo;s voice booms through the speakers, interrupting you both and alerting the two of you of the team meeting, with hopefully good news or any news regarding the other metas in the city.</p><p>&ldquo;Race ya there?&rdquo; Barry smirks, getting ready to run.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re so on Flash.&rdquo; You chuckle, as you both run out of the speed lab, straight to the cortex.</p><p>Your relationship with Barry was kind of unusual. You weren&rsquo;t together but sometimes you both acted like you were? It was a sort of unspoken thing and you guess that the reason that neither of you questioned it or said anything is because, well the both of you didn&rsquo;t want things to go bad between each other. You were good friends, throughout all the bad stuff that had happened to you both, you were always there for each other. You loved Barry and Barry loved you. When the particle accelerator exploded, Barry and you had gotten your powers, the exact same powers. You were visiting him at his lab at CCPD when it had happened, woke up a few months later and your lives were forever changed. With the good, came the bad, arguments and disagreements with Barry were more often and it wasn&rsquo;t something either of you liked. But you both worked on it, communicating better, and things have been going well. It has been 3 years and your friendship were still strong, but now it was also a partnership, The Flash and Swift.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Barry, Y/N, I need you both to take these with you, run somewhere and wait for our signal.&rdquo; Cisco says as we enter the cortex, handing us the tachyon devices.</p><p>Taking the identical devices from Cisco, Barry and you speed change into your suits and sped away, meeting at the Keystone City boarder. Coming to a stop, Barry gives you a nod and you both start to talk to everyone back at S.T.A.R Labs through the comms, waiting for the signal.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Okay you guys, we&rsquo;re here, you got our location?&rdquo; Barry asks through his comms, awaiting a response from Cisco or even Caitlin, as you did too. You were excited to try the tachyon device out, it&rsquo;s supposed to be like this supercharge battery that well, charges the speed force in us.</p><p>Back at S.T.A.R Labs, Cisco asks us, &ldquo;You good? You guys don&rsquo;t need to like stretch or somethin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;No no no we&rsquo;re good, Cisco.&rdquo; You answer, chuckling at your friend.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take this tachyon enhancer out for a test drive.&rdquo; Cisco says trying to sound cool, Caitlin and Iris standing closely behind him, not wanting to miss anything.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Alright.&rdquo; You say as you turn to face Barry. His hands come up to cup your face, fingers lightly brushing your cheeks before he places a gentle kiss to your lips. Pulling away, he nods, gives you a reassuring smile and places the device on his chest, you mimic his actions, jumping a bit at the sudden reaction you feel your body have to it, you feel kind of jittery and well, nervous. You lick your lips and ball up your fists before squeezing your eyes shut as you mentally prepare for the outcome of this.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Whoo! Yeah!&rdquo; Barry exhales, feeling the device work.</p><p>You have the same reaction; it really does feel like your speed force cells are being supercharged. &ldquo;Woah, I feel that!&rdquo; You exhale.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;That is the tachyon device, powering up the speed force in your cells like a quick charge battery.&rdquo; Caitlin says, sounding very chipper.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;How do you guys feel?&rdquo; She asks.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, weird, but in a good way.&rdquo; You answer, feeling a rush of energy.</p><p>&ldquo;Different, really different.&rdquo; Barry says with a sweet smile plastered on his face. His excitement was quite evident.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see how long it takes for you to get back here, on my count&hellip;&rdquo; Cisco says. That was the signal, well kind of, it was a count-down but same thing. You and Barry, got into position, waiting for that go.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;You ready Flash?&rdquo; You smirk at the handsome speedster next to you.</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;3..2&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As ready as you are Swift.&rdquo; He grins, shooting you a rather flirty smirk.</p><p>&ldquo;..1..Go!&rdquo; Cisco says as starts watching the timer on the clock, waiting for Barry and you to return to the S.T.A.R Labs.</p><p>Barry and you run, much much faster than before.<br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Dang, this thing has them crusin&rsquo;&hellip;&rdquo; Cisco says, honestly impressed by you guys speed.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;How fast do they normally go?&rdquo; Iris asks, interested about this whole situation and kind of worried about you and Barry.</p><p>&ldquo;Not this fast.&rdquo; Caitlin says nonchalantly.</p><p>&ldquo;Not even close, are their vitals okay?&rdquo; Cisco asks as his eyes widen at how fast the two of you are running around, the city.</p><p>Looking at the screen, Caitlin is relieved and kind of impressed, &ldquo;Yeah, they&rsquo;re perfect.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Cool, it&rsquo;s like having a pit stop attached to your chest.&rdquo; Iris says impressed.</p><p>&ldquo;Guys, I can go faster!&rdquo; You say as you ran throughout the city.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, guys, me too!&rdquo; Barry says.</p><p>A grin appears on Cisco&rsquo;s face as he simply says, &ldquo;Do it.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Smiling to yourself you ran, faster that you&rsquo;ve ever ran before. Hell, probably faster than Barry has too, but you sort of ran so fast that you managed to travel to another Earth. You didn&rsquo;t know that at first, but you found out eventually.</p><p><br /></p><p>How did you find that out, well eventually from the guy dressed in a red and blue suit who you saved from a falling building indirectly told you so? After speaking to him for a few minutes you knew for a fact that he wasn&rsquo;t a meta from Central City.</p><p>You had spotted him the moment you came to a stop, scanning the area you, ran up the building, catching him swiftly, like your name sake and ran towards a field, although you didn&rsquo;t mean too.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on fire!&rdquo; the guy exclaims, through his mask as he tried to put the fire out.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah uh&hellip; sorry about that it happens sometimes, with the fiction of running at&hellip;&rdquo; You say but the actions of the guy makes you stop for a moment, you look at him, his suit, head to toe and wonder, who is he and where did he get it, but he has something else to say, something extremely weird but not unbelievable.</p><p>&ldquo;You sound like her.&rdquo; He says, taking a step back and removing his mask. You examined his face, but sadness clouded his features. He looked at you, but you had your mask on, your identity was still hidden, and it seemed to disappoint him.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;By the way, I didn&rsquo;t need you to save me.&rdquo; He grimaced.</p><p>You were taken aback by that statement, confused. &ldquo;Uh, yeah you did, you were falling out of a building, if I hadn&rsquo;t saved you would be splat.&rdquo; You say, crossing your arms.</p><p><br /></p><p>He shakes his head before putting his mask back on, &ldquo;I-uh have to get back to the city.&rdquo; He says, turning around and starts swinging in the air. Shooting webs out of his wrists, he moved like a spider.

I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t tell you- You\u2019re walking really fast,\u201d he said. You slowed down. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell you because I didnt want you to worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI AM worried. Like really worried. You almost died. I saw it on tv,\u201d you said. You had stopped walking on a street corner. A rude look from a woman with a stroller you kept moving. </p><p>\u201cI mean, we both died in the snap,\u201d he said. You gave him a look. \u201cThat\u2019s not the point.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy did you tell MJ before me? Is this why you are so close?\u201d You asked. You looked up trying to not cry. It was stupid. </p><p>\u201cI mean kinda. I didn\u2019t tell her. Or Ned. Or Aunt May. They all found out like you did. Because I\u2019m an idiot. Sorry,\u201d he said walking around a guy sitting on the street. \u201cCan we stop somewhere?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d you said pulling him into a pizzeria. The air conditioner felt nice. You sat at a table. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Now you know. I just didn\u2019t want you to worry or get hurt. I\u2019m an idiot okay? Complete idiot. Please don\u2019t be mad at me,\u201d he said with his big brown eyes and you wanted to be mad but couldn\u2019t. </p><p>\u201cNo more secrets?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo more. Your grandma is planning a surprise party next weekend for your birthday,\u201d he said. </p><p>\u201cWhy would you ruin that?\u201d You said shocked. Peter closed his eyes and covered his face. </p><p>\u201cYou said no secrets. I really am an idiot,\u201d he laughed nervously. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I just don\u2019t-</p><p>\u201cShut up.

You could tell he was lying, badly. &ldquo;Just pjs. Pajamas.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You wear a Spider-Man suit&hellip; to bed?&rdquo; You asked looking at him. He gulped visibly. </p><p>&ldquo;Big fan, yeah. You?&rdquo; He asked and you stared slightly open mouthed lost for words. </p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s..Fine. You&rsquo;re Spider-Man aren&rsquo;t you? That&rsquo;s you,&rdquo; you said. Peter looked a bit like he wanted to pass out. </p><p>&ldquo;Nope. I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; he said shaking his head. </p><p>&ldquo;Shut up. It&rsquo;s obvious. How long?&rdquo; You asked. The door opened and Ned and MJ walked in. </p><p>&ldquo;She knows too?!&rdquo; Ned asked. </p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Peter said. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah I know. How long have you two known?&rdquo; You asked suspiciously. </p><p>&ldquo;A few years,&rdquo; Ned blurt out. </p><p>&ldquo;Since last year,&rdquo; MJ added.

I\u2019d finished five minutes ago but I was going back over every single answer. There was one question that I wasn\u2019t sure about. I specifically remembered Peter explaining how to do this problem but I couldn\u2019t remember whether the explanation contained \u2018<i>do</i>\u2019 or \u2018<i>do not</i>.\u2019</p><p>\u201cFuck it,\u201d I mumbled under my breath as I boxed in my answer and stood up. </p><p>I wasn\u2019t the first one done but normally I was the last one finished so a lot of people turned to look at me. I kept my eyes on the clock as I marched up to my teacher\u2019s desk. He looked at me over his glasses like a hawk watching a mouse. </p><p>\u201cMs. (Y/L/N),\u201d he muttered as he took my test from my hand. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to check your answers again?\u201d </p><p><i>I\u2019ll check my answers up your butt. </i></p><p>I shook my head and marched out of the classroom. It was mid passing period when I got to my locker and I had to elbow my way through people that had no spacial awareness. I winced as my locker door bounced off my head with a clang and gave the guy next to me a dirty look. Luckily for him the hallway began to clear out before I could hurt him and make it look like an accident. </p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d someone said from behind me. I glanced over my shoulder to see Peter nervously gripping the straps of his backpack. \u201cHow\u2019d the test go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was only one that tripped me up!\u201d I said excitedly. \u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough!\u201d</p><p>I threw my arms around his neck and this time he hugged me back immediately. He lifted me off the ground as he hugged me tighter in a bone crushing hug. I laughed as he set me back down. </p><p>\u201cHey, guys.\u201d</p><p>Peter and I jumped away from each other to see MJ and Ned standing next to each other. Both of them had the same stupid shit eating grin plastered across their faces. Before I could say anything Peter began to stammer out what he must have thought sounded like an explanation. I elbowed him in the side and he immediately shut his mouth. </p><p>\u201cHey MJ, Ned\u2026\u201d I started. \u201cUh\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d the math test go?\u201d MJ asked, leaning against the lockers. </p><p>\u201cI think I did really well,\u201d I said turning to close my locker. \u201cPeter was just congratulating me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like more than congratulating\u2026\u201d MJ muttered next to my ear. </p><p>\u201cSo are you guys excited about the\u2026\u201d Ned trailed off and dramatically looked up and down the hallway. </p><p>\u201c<i>the party</i>?\u201d he whispered. I laughed as MJ and Peter stared at him. </p><p>The bell rang before I could respond to Ned and MJ and I left Ned and Peter standing at my locker and I could feel her judgement bubbling inside her.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wanna talk about it,\u201d I muttered, making her grin even wider. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>MJ and I walked up the stairs to Betty\u2019s house and stood at the front door. </p><p>\u201cJust how loaded do we think Betty\u2019s parents are?\u201d I asked MJ, still looking up at the house. </p><p>\u201cA three story home in one of the most expensive neighborhoods in Brooklyn?\u201d MJ replied, also looking up at the house. \u201cYou wanna ask? If I ask it\u2019ll be without- what was is you said- tact?\u201d</p><p>I snorted as she opened the door and I followed her in. The house was bursting at the seams with students from Midtown; half of which were drunk and half of which were stoned. As soon as we crossed the threshold, I immediately regretted coming to this party. \u00a0</p><p>MJ\u2019s hand was already around my wrist. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m here, you\u2019re here,\u201d she muttered out of the corner of her mouth as she waved at someone across the room. \u201cWe\u2019ll just stay until Peter and Ned get here and then we can leave.\u201d</p><p>I yanked my arm from her and grudgingly sighed. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go get us something to drink,\u201d I said as MJ <i>lovingly</i> flipped me off before strutting into the kitchen. </p><p>I sighed and squeezed in between drunken teenagers until I was standing in front of a drink table that had been heavily looted. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw someone slide up next to me</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, (Y/L/N)?\u201d </p><p>I turned to see Flash leaning against the drink table. He was looking at me with what I could only describe as dull bedroom eyes. Creepy, dull bedroom eyes. </p><p>\u201cUh. Hey, Flash, \u201d I said as I turned around to go find MJ. </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t usually come out to parties,\u201d Flash said, following me (unfortunately.) \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you out living life instead of cooped up studying with Penis Parker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d I asked over my shoulder. Flash was generally annoying but right now he was being <i>exceptionally</i> annoying. </p><p>I finally spotted MJ-eating gherkins from the jar- standing at Betty\u2019s kitchen counter. </p><p>\u201cWell, ya know,\u201d he said, still following me. \u201cOne of the cutest girls in Academic Decathlon hanging out with one of the weirdest dudes\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh,\u201d I was a little lost for words. </p><p>I passed MJ her drink and widened my eyes at her in a non verbal \u2018yikes.\u2019 She didn\u2019t respond but held a gherkin out on the end of her fork and I rolled my eyes before accepting and letting her feed it to me. </p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u2019 Flash said leaning against the counter next to me. \u201cI heard Penis was helping you study for the calc test, which is weird because he\u2019s not even in our class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call him that,\u201d I said taking a sip of my drink and grimacing as it burnt my throat. \u201cAnd does it matter who I study calc with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t, but I\u2019m pretty sure I have a better grade in calc-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah fuckin\u2019 right, Flash,\u201d MJ said crunching on a pickle. </p><p>Flash looked a little dejected but obviously MJ and I were going to have to be meaner to him if we wanted him to leave us alone. </p><p>\u201cAnyway, (Y/N), you take the bus right?\u201d he asked. </p><p>\u201cI used to. I take the subway now,\u201d I said taking another sip and grimacing. <i>Why is everyone so concerned with my method of commute?</i></p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Flash said sliding closer to me along the counter. I glanced at MJ who looked away with a nonverbal \u2018oof.\u2019 Flash\u2019s hip bumped mine and he put his arm over my shoulders. \u201cI happen to have a car and if you ever want a ride to school\u2026\u201d</p><p>I glanced at the floor before taking a large gulp of my drink- followed by a grimace. Flash wouldn\u2019t shut up and I really wanted to stab him with the fork MJ was using but decided to just drink more. And grimace more. </p><p>I heard someone say my name as I took another sip of my drink. I looked up to see Peter standing in front of me, and I felt butterflies in my stomach. He was looking at Flash like he was going to break his arm, and it was\u2026 kind of a turn on?</p><p>\u201cPeter!\u201d I gasped. I threw Flash\u2019s arm off and grabbed Peter around the neck. His arms were around my waist almost right away. </p><p>\u201cOh thank God. Please tell me Flash is gone,\u201d I whispered into his ear. </p><p>\u201cHey what\u2019s up Penis?\u201d Flash said, answering my question. I felt Peter stiffen slightly. \u201cI was telling (Y/N) that I could drive her to school sometime. You know\u2026\u201d</p><p>Flash continued to taIk and I pulled away to look at Peter. He looked irritated but otherwise fine. I rolled my eyes as he droned on behind us. </p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t get lost,\u201d Peter murmured quietly as he smirked down at me. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah, well. I had MJ,\u201d I said. I was definitely beginning to feel buzzed. </p><p>\u201cHey, Penis,\u201d Flash said behind us. \u201cWhat\u2019s it like wiping Tony Stark\u2019s ass everyday?\u201d</p><p>I abruptly turned around. </p><p>\u201cOh my God, Flash. Are you <i>still</i> here?\u201d I asked looking him up and down. \u201cIsn\u2019t there somewhere else you can be insecure about your dick size?\u201d </p><p>Flash looked more surprised than offended by what I said, but nonetheless stalked out of the kitchen. </p><p>\u201cYikes, that was a little harsh, (Y/N),\u201d Ned said. He was standing next to Peter, who was smiling ear to ear. </p><p>\u201cHi, Ned. Nice hat,\u201d I said finishing off my drink. I let out a rasping breath, almost expecting fire to come out of my mouth. \u201cAnd, yeah. Probably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, even Ned thinks you were harsh,\u201d MJ said, offering me another gherkin. I accepted. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll get over it,\u201d Peter said, still grinning. </p><p>\u201cI need another drink and you two don\u2019t have one,\u201d I said looking back and forth between Ned and Peter. \u201cAnd I only have two hands, do-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you!\u201d Ned blurted. </p><p>Peter glanced over at him and Ned nodded at him. I furrowed my eyebrows and looked between my three friends. MJ was looking at Ned the same way Peter was; the only difference being that Peter was rapidly turning pink. </p><p>Ned and I made our way to the drink table and I smiled at his excitement. </p><p>\u201cAre you\u2026?\u201d I asked holding up a bottle of clear alcohol. He shook his head. \u201cDo you think Peter\u2026?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t say no before we left so\u2026\u201d </p><p>I smiled and made Peter a weak drink. </p><p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Ned started. \u201cYou and Peter\u2026\u201d</p><p>I froze and felt my cheeks begin to get warm. </p><p>\u201cDid Peter put you up to this?\u201d I asked as I handed him a soda. Ned didn\u2019t have a good poker face but he didn\u2019t say anything else. I smiled. \u201cC\u2019mon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do you\u2026 ya know\u2026?\u201d Ned asked as we walked back into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to be more specific,\u201d I said as I turned around and quickly walked straight to Peter and handed him his drink. \u201cNed and I just had a very interesting conversation, Peter.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes widened into his drink and he quickly brought the cup to his mouth and took a gulp- one that he obviously regretted. He made a face similar to the one that I made every time I took a sip of my drink. </p><p>\u201cI assume it was, I can\u2019t really remember,\u201d I said glancing at Ned out of the corner of my eye. He visibly relaxed. </p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t remember? How much have you had to drink? Or, uh, how long have you been here?\u201d Peter asked as he set his drink down on the counter. I look another large sip. </p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d I said through a grimace. \u201cDo you know what the term \u2018light-weight\u2019 means?\u201d</p><p>MJ and Peter chuckled as I took another sip that burned less than the first drink did. I had a feeling that tonight was going to be a good night. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>The subway was pretty empty, so Peter and I were able to sit this time. Ned sat across from us and MJ was standing. She had to change trains before any of our stops. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you Sunday,\u201d she said. We were holding pinkies in my semi-drunken state. \u201cAnd please get home safe you fuckin\u2019 dork.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes and smiled at her.</p><p>\u201cI looove you, MJ,\u201d I said as the train pulled to a stop. </p><p>\u201cEw.\u201d</p><p>She stepped off the train. </p><p>\u201cI LOVE YOU!\u201d I yelled after her. </p><p>\u201cI DON\u2019T KNOW YOU!\u201d</p><p>The doors closed and my butt vibrated as the train began to take off. I had to squint at my phone because I was maybe a little too drunk to read. </p><p>MJ: love you too. </p><p>Ned got off at the next stop and as soon as the train took off I laid my head on Peter\u2019s shoulder. </p><p>\u201cDo you know which stop you are?\u201d he asked. I squinted up at the subway map. </p><p>\u201cIf I say no does that mean you\u2019ll walk me home?\u201d I asked. He chuckled. </p><p>\u201cTo the side walk?\u201d </p><p>I felt my heart start to pick up the pace. </p><p>\u201cUh, actually. Do you want to maybe watch that crime documentary?\u201d I asked nervously. Peter looked down at me and I shifted to look up at him. He had a smile tugging at the corner of his mouth and he arched an eyebrow at me. \u201cOnly if you want to though, I wouldn\u2019t want-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI want to,\u201d he said. I broke a smile and he smiled back down at me. \u201cAlso, the next stop is yours.\u201d</p><p>He stood up and held his hand out to help me up. I graciously accepted. Normally I would have immediately let go of his hand but in my emboldened state I entwined my fingers in his as we walked towards the doors. He squeezed my hand as we stepped off the train. </p><p>The walk to my apartment was comfortably quiet. Every now and then, one of us would comment about our immediate surroundings but we didn\u2019t speak any further than that. </p><p>My mind was racing. Well, as much as it could run with the amount of alcohol it was handling. </p><p><i>We\u2019re just going to watch people murdering each other. Do not set any expectations for this, (Y/N). </i></p><p>But I couldn\u2019t help but let my mind wander. I imagined his lips on mine; what they would feel like on mine, if they\u2019d be soft. I glanced at him, trying to determine if he had chapped lips or not. He noticed. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he said using his other hand to wipe his upper lip. \u201cDo I have a pimple or something?\u201d </p><p>I shook my head and looked away. We walked further down the block and I almost had my arm ripped out of the socket when I walked past Peter. I turned to look back at him irritably. He had a very smug look on his face and he simply pointed at the building in front of us. </p><p>Which was my building. </p><p>\u201cHow drunk are you?\u201d he asked as I opened the door and walked to the elevator. There was a maintenance sign taped to it, indicating it was not functional. </p><p>\u201cOof. Too drunk to take the fuckin\u2019 stairs that is fo\u2019 sho.\u201d</p><p><i>Fo\u2019 sho\u2019? The fuck was that?</i></p><p>Suddenly, I wasn\u2019t on my feet anymore: Peter had scooped me up in his arms and was already carrying me up the stairs. </p><p>\u201cPeter! Stop, it\u2019s- I live on the fifth floor,\u201d I said wrapping my arms around his neck. </p><p>\u201cShut up, its fine,\u201d he responded. His voice was surprisingly even, and as we started up the second flight of stairs he didn\u2019t even break a sweat. </p><p>On the fifth floor, Peter set me down and I let us into my apartment. I gave Peter the remote and I retreated to my room so I could change. Staring in the mirror, I took a couple deep breaths. </p><p><i>No expectations. </i></p><p>Peter was playing a game on his phone when I walked out into the living room. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in my spot,\u201d I teased as I sat next to him and curled my feet under me. </p><p>He chuckled and started the episode. The alcohol was making me feel brave, so I scooted closer to him and laid my head on his shoulder. He stiffened for the briefest moment before he shifted and around put his arm around my shoulder. </p><p>Peter began to run his fingers through my hair and I leaned against his hand, inviting him to continue. I took the hem of his shirt and began to roll the seam in my finger tips. It started to get harder to keep my eyes open and I felt myself drifting off. </p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d I mumbled. He hummed at me. \u201cI want to lay down.\u201d</p><p>I began to sit up so I could go to my bedroom but Peter shifted around so I could lay against his chest along the couch and still watch the show. I smiled as I listened to his heart beat and began to match my breathing to his. I could tell I was about to fall asleep as Peter continued to play with my hair.</p><p>\u201cPeter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said as I let my eyes close. </p><p>\u201cFor?\u201d he asked shifted a little. His cheek was now pressed into the top of my head. </p><p>The best I could respond with was a hum as I began to drift out of consciousness and into the world of sleep. \u00a0</p>",

Flash was generally annoying but right now he was being <i>exceptionally</i> annoying. </p><p>I finally spotted MJ-eating gherkins from the jar- standing at Betty\u2019s kitchen counter. </p><p>\u201cWell, ya know,\u201d he said, still following me. \u201cOne of the cutest girls in Academic Decathlon hanging out with one of the weirdest dudes\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh,\u201d I was a little lost for words. </p><p>I passed MJ her drink and widened my eyes at her in a non verbal \u2018yikes.\u2019 She didn\u2019t respond but held a gherkin out on the end of her fork and I rolled my eyes before accepting and letting her feed it to me. </p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u2019 Flash said leaning against the counter next to me. \u201cI heard Penis was helping you study for the calc test, which is weird because he\u2019s not even in our class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call him that,\u201d I said taking a sip of my drink and grimacing as it burnt my throat. \u201cAnd does it matter who I study calc with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t, but I\u2019m pretty sure I have a better grade in calc-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah fuckin\u2019 right, Flash,\u201d MJ said crunching on a pickle. </p><p>Flash looked a little dejected but obviously MJ and I were going to have to be meaner to him if we wanted him to leave us alone. </p><p>\u201cAnyway, (Y/N), you take the bus right?\u201d he asked. </p><p>\u201cI used to. I take the subway now,\u201d I said taking another sip and grimacing. <i>Why is everyone so concerned with my method of commute?</i></p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Flash said sliding closer to me along the counter. I glanced at MJ who looked away with a nonverbal \u2018oof.\u2019 Flash\u2019s hip bumped mine and he put his arm over my shoulders. \u201cI happen to have a car and if you ever want a ride to school\u2026\u201d</p><p>I glanced at the floor before taking a large gulp of my drink- followed by a grimace. Flash wouldn\u2019t shut up and I really wanted to stab him with the fork MJ was using but decided to just drink more. And grimace more. </p><p>I heard someone say my name as I took another sip of my drink. I looked up to see Peter standing in front of me, and I felt butterflies in my stomach. He was looking at Flash like he was going to break his arm, and it was\u2026 kind of a turn on?</p><p>\u201cPeter!\u201d I gasped. I threw Flash\u2019s arm off and grabbed Peter around the neck. His arms were around my waist almost right away. </p><p>\u201cOh thank God. Please tell me Flash is gone,\u201d I whispered into his ear. </p><p>\u201cHey what\u2019s up Penis?\u201d Flash said, answering my question. I felt Peter stiffen slightly. \u201cI was telling (Y/N) that I could drive her to school sometime. You know\u2026\u201d</p><p>Flash continued to taIk and I pulled away to look at Peter. He looked irritated but otherwise fine. I rolled my eyes as he droned on behind us. </p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t get lost,\u201d Peter murmured quietly as he smirked down at me. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah, well. I had MJ,\u201d I said. I was definitely beginning to feel buzzed. </p><p>\u201cHey, Penis,\u201d Flash said behind us. \u201cWhat\u2019s it like wiping Tony Stark\u2019s ass everyday?\u201d</p><p>I abruptly turned around. </p><p>\u201cOh my God, Flash. Are you <i>still</i> here?\u201d I asked looking him up and down. \u201cIsn\u2019t there somewhere else you can be insecure about your dick size?\u201d </p><p>Flash looked more surprised than offended by what I said, but nonetheless stalked out of the kitchen. </p><p>\u201cYikes, that was a little harsh, (Y/N),\u201d Ned said. He was standing next to Peter, who was smiling ear to ear. </p><p>\u201cHi, Ned. Nice hat,\u201d I said finishing off my drink. I let out a rasping breath, almost expecting fire to come out of my mouth. \u201cAnd, yeah. Probably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, even Ned thinks you were harsh,\u201d MJ said, offering me another gherkin. I accepted. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll get over it,\u201d Peter said, still grinning. </p><p>\u201cI need another drink and you two don\u2019t have one,\u201d I said looking back and forth between Ned and Peter. \u201cAnd I only have two hands, do-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you!\u201d Ned blurted. </p><p>Peter glanced over at him and Ned nodded at him. I furrowed my eyebrows and looked between my three friends. MJ was looking at Ned the same way Peter was; the only difference being that Peter was rapidly turning pink. </p><p>Ned and I made our way to the drink table and I smiled at his excitement. </p><p>\u201cAre you\u2026?\u201d I asked holding up a bottle of clear alcohol. He shook his head. \u201cDo you think Peter\u2026?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t say no before we left so\u2026\u201d </p><p>I smiled and made Peter a weak drink. </p><p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Ned started. \u201cYou and Peter\u2026\u201d</p><p>I froze and felt my cheeks begin to get warm. </p><p>\u201cDid Peter put you up to this?\u201d I asked as I handed him a soda. Ned didn\u2019t have a good poker face but he didn\u2019t say anything else. I smiled. \u201cC\u2019mon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do you\u2026 ya know\u2026?\u201d Ned asked as we walked back into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to be more specific,\u201d I said as I turned around and quickly walked straight to Peter and handed him his drink. \u201cNed and I just had a very interesting conversation, Peter.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes widened into his drink and he quickly brought the cup to his mouth and took a gulp- one that he obviously regretted. He made a face similar to the one that I made every time I took a sip of my drink. </p><p>\u201cI assume it was, I can\u2019t really remember,\u201d I said glancing at Ned out of the corner of my eye. He visibly relaxed. </p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t remember? How much have you had to drink? Or, uh, how long have you been here?\u201d Peter asked as he set his drink down on the counter. I look another large sip. </p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d I said through a grimace. \u201cDo you know what the term \u2018light-weight\u2019 means?\u201d</p><p>MJ and Peter chuckled as I took another sip that burned less than the first drink did. I had a feeling that tonight was going to be a good night. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>The subway was pretty empty, so Peter and I were able to sit this time. Ned sat across from us and MJ was standing. She had to change trains before any of our stops. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you Sunday,\u201d she said. We were holding pinkies in my semi-drunken state. \u201cAnd please get home safe you fuckin\u2019 dork.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes and smiled at her.</p><p>\u201cI looove you, MJ,\u201d I said as the train pulled to a stop. </p><p>\u201cEw.\u201d</p><p>She stepped off the train. </p><p>\u201cI LOVE YOU!\u201d I yelled after her. </p><p>\u201cI DON\u2019T KNOW YOU!\u201d</p><p>The doors closed and my butt vibrated as the train began to take off. I had to squint at my phone because I was maybe a little too drunk to read. </p><p>MJ: love you too. </p><p>Ned got off at the next stop and as soon as the train took off I laid my head on Peter\u2019s shoulder. </p><p>\u201cDo you know which stop you are?\u201d he asked. I squinted up at the subway map. </p><p>\u201cIf I say no does that mean you\u2019ll walk me home?\u201d I asked. He chuckled. </p><p>\u201cTo the side walk?\u201d </p><p>I felt my heart start to pick up the pace. </p><p>\u201cUh, actually. Do you want to maybe watch that crime documentary?\u201d I asked nervously. Peter looked down at me and I shifted to look up at him. He had a smile tugging at the corner of his mouth and he arched an eyebrow at me. \u201cOnly if you want to though, I wouldn\u2019t want-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI want to,\u201d he said. I broke a smile and he smiled back down at me. \u201cAlso, the next stop is yours.\u201d</p><p>He stood up and held his hand out to help me up. I graciously accepted. Normally I would have immediately let go of his hand but in my emboldened state I entwined my fingers in his as we walked towards the doors. He squeezed my hand as we stepped off the train. </p><p>The walk to my apartment was comfortably quiet. Every now and then, one of us would comment about our immediate surroundings but we didn\u2019t speak any further than that. </p><p>My mind was racing. Well, as much as it could run with the amount of alcohol it was handling. </p><p><i>We\u2019re just going to watch people murdering each other. Do not set any expectations for this, (Y/N). </i></p><p>But I couldn\u2019t help but let my mind wander. I imagined his lips on mine; what they would feel like on mine, if they\u2019d be soft. I glanced at him, trying to determine if he had chapped lips or not. He noticed. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he said using his other hand to wipe his upper lip. \u201cDo I have a pimple or something?\u201d </p><p>I shook my head and looked away. We walked further down the block and I almost had my arm ripped out of the socket when I walked past Peter. I turned to look back at him irritably. He had a very smug look on his face and he simply pointed at the building in front of us. </p><p>Which was my building. </p><p>\u201cHow drunk are you?\u201d he asked as I opened the door and walked to the elevator. There was a maintenance sign taped to it, indicating it was not functional. </p><p>\u201cOof. Too drunk to take the fuckin\u2019 stairs that is fo\u2019 sho.\u201d</p><p><i>Fo\u2019 sho\u2019? The fuck was that?</i></p><p>Suddenly, I wasn\u2019t on my feet anymore: Peter had scooped me up in his arms and was already carrying me up the stairs. </p><p>\u201cPeter! Stop, it\u2019s- I live on the fifth floor,\u201d I said wrapping my arms around his neck. </p><p>\u201cShut up, its fine,\u201d he responded. His voice was surprisingly even, and as we started up the second flight of stairs he didn\u2019t even break a sweat. </p><p>On the fifth floor, Peter set me down and I let us into my apartment. I gave Peter the remote and I retreated to my room so I could change. Staring in the mirror, I took a couple deep breaths. </p><p><i>No expectations. </i></p><p>Peter was playing a game on his phone when I walked out into the living room. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in my spot,\u201d I teased as I sat next to him and curled my feet under me. </p><p>He chuckled and started the episode. The alcohol was making me feel brave, so I scooted closer to him and laid my head on his shoulder. He stiffened for the briefest moment before he shifted and around put his arm around my shoulder. </p><p>Peter began to run his fingers through my hair and I leaned against his hand, inviting him to continue. I took the hem of his shirt and began to roll the seam in my finger tips. It started to get harder to keep my eyes open and I felt myself drifting off. </p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d I mumbled. He hummed at me. \u201cI want to lay down.\u201d</p><p>I began to sit up so I could go to my bedroom but Peter shifted around so I could lay against his chest along the couch and still watch the show. I smiled as I listened to his heart beat and began to match my breathing to his. I could tell I was about to fall asleep as Peter continued to play with my hair.</p><p>\u201cPeter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said as I let my eyes close. </p><p>\u201cFor?\u201d he asked shifted a little. His cheek was now pressed into the top of my head. </p><p>The best I could respond with was a hum as I began to drift out of consciousness and into the world of sleep. \u00a0</p></p>",

I\u2019d finished five minutes ago but I was going back over every single answer. There was one question that I wasn\u2019t sure about. I specifically remembered Peter explaining how to do this problem but I couldn\u2019t remember whether the explanation contained \u2018<i>do</i>\u2019 or \u2018<i>do not</i>.\u2019</p><p>\u201cFuck it,\u201d I mumbled under my breath as I boxed in my answer and stood up. </p><p>I wasn\u2019t the first one done but normally I was the last one finished so a lot of people turned to look at me. I kept my eyes on the clock as I marched up to my teacher\u2019s desk. He looked at me over his glasses like a hawk watching a mouse. </p><p>\u201cMs. (Y/L/N),\u201d he muttered as he took my test from my hand. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to check your answers again?\u201d </p><p><i>I\u2019ll check my answers up your butt. </i></p><p>I shook my head and marched out of the classroom. It was mid passing period when I got to my locker and I had to elbow my way through people that had no spacial awareness. I winced as my locker door bounced off my head with a clang and gave the guy next to me a dirty look. Luckily for him the hallway began to clear out before I could hurt him and make it look like an accident. </p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d someone said from behind me. I glanced over my shoulder to see Peter nervously gripping the straps of his backpack. \u201cHow\u2019d the test go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was only one that tripped me up!\u201d I said excitedly. \u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough!\u201d</p><p>I threw my arms around his neck and this time he hugged me back immediately. He lifted me off the ground as he hugged me tighter in a bone crushing hug. I laughed as he set me back down. </p><p>\u201cHey, guys.\u201d</p><p>Peter and I jumped away from each other to see MJ and Ned standing next to each other. Both of them had the same stupid shit eating grin plastered across their faces. Before I could say anything Peter began to stammer out what he must have thought sounded like an explanation. I elbowed him in the side and he immediately shut his mouth. </p><p>\u201cHey MJ, Ned\u2026\u201d I started. \u201cUh\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d the math test go?\u201d MJ asked, leaning against the lockers. </p><p>\u201cI think I did really well,\u201d I said turning to close my locker. \u201cPeter was just congratulating me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like more than congratulating\u2026\u201d MJ muttered next to my ear. </p><p>\u201cSo are you guys excited about the\u2026\u201d Ned trailed off and dramatically looked up and down the hallway. </p><p>\u201c<i>the party</i>?\u201d he whispered. I laughed as MJ and Peter stared at him. </p><p>The bell rang before I could respond to Ned and MJ and I left Ned and Peter standing at my locker and I could feel her judgement bubbling inside her.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wanna talk about it,\u201d I muttered, making her grin even wider. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>MJ and I walked up the stairs to Betty\u2019s house and stood at the front door. </p><p>\u201cJust how loaded do we think Betty\u2019s parents are?\u201d I asked MJ, still looking up at the house. </p><p>\u201cA three story home in one of the most expensive neighborhoods in Brooklyn?\u201d MJ replied, also looking up at the house. \u201cYou wanna ask? If I ask it\u2019ll be without- what was is you said- tact?\u201d</p><p>I snorted as she opened the door and I followed her in. The house was bursting at the seams with students from Midtown; half of which were drunk and half of which were stoned. As soon as we crossed the threshold, I immediately regretted coming to this party. \u00a0</p><p>MJ\u2019s hand was already around my wrist. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m here, you\u2019re here,\u201d she muttered out of the corner of her mouth as she waved at someone across the room. \u201cWe\u2019ll just stay until Peter and Ned get here and then we can leave.\u201d</p><p>I yanked my arm from her and grudgingly sighed. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go get us something to drink,\u201d I said as MJ <i>lovingly</i> flipped me off before strutting into the kitchen. </p><p>I sighed and squeezed in between drunken teenagers until I was standing in front of a drink table that had been heavily looted. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw someone slide up next to me</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, (Y/L/N)?\u201d </p><p>I turned to see Flash leaning against the drink table. He was looking at me with what I could only describe as dull bedroom eyes. Creepy, dull bedroom eyes. </p><p>\u201cUh. Hey, Flash, \u201d I said as I turned around to go find MJ. </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t usually come out to parties,\u201d Flash said, following me (unfortunately.) \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you out living life instead of cooped up studying with Penis Parker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d I asked over my shoulder. Flash was generally annoying but right now he was being <i>exceptionally</i> annoying. </p><p>I finally spotted MJ-eating gherkins from the jar- standing at Betty\u2019s kitchen counter. </p><p>\u201cWell, ya know,\u201d he said, still following me. \u201cOne of the cutest girls in Academic Decathlon hanging out with one of the weirdest dudes\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh,\u201d I was a little lost for words. </p><p>I passed MJ her drink and widened my eyes at her in a non verbal \u2018yikes.\u2019 She didn\u2019t respond but held a gherkin out on the end of her fork and I rolled my eyes before accepting and letting her feed it to me. </p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u2019 Flash said leaning against the counter next to me. \u201cI heard Penis was helping you study for the calc test, which is weird because he\u2019s not even in our class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call him that,\u201d I said taking a sip of my drink and grimacing as it burnt my throat. \u201cAnd does it matter who I study calc with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t, but I\u2019m pretty sure I have a better grade in calc-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah fuckin\u2019 right, Flash,\u201d MJ said crunching on a pickle. </p><p>Flash looked a little dejected but obviously MJ and I were going to have to be meaner to him if we wanted him to leave us alone. </p><p>\u201cAnyway, (Y/N), you take the bus right?\u201d he asked. </p><p>\u201cI used to. I take the subway now,\u201d I said taking another sip and grimacing. <i>Why is everyone so concerned with my method of commute?</i></p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Flash said sliding closer to me along the counter. I glanced at MJ who looked away with a nonverbal \u2018oof.\u2019 Flash\u2019s hip bumped mine and he put his arm over my shoulders. \u201cI happen to have a car and if you ever want a ride to school\u2026\u201d</p><p>I glanced at the floor before taking a large gulp of my drink- followed by a grimace. Flash wouldn\u2019t shut up and I really wanted to stab him with the fork MJ was using but decided to just drink more. And grimace more. </p><p>I heard someone say my name as I took another sip of my drink. I looked up to see Peter standing in front of me, and I felt butterflies in my stomach. He was looking at Flash like he was going to break his arm, and it was\u2026 kind of a turn on?</p><p>\u201cPeter!\u201d I gasped. I threw Flash\u2019s arm off and grabbed Peter around the neck. His arms were around my waist almost right away. </p><p>\u201cOh thank God. Please tell me Flash is gone,\u201d I whispered into his ear. </p><p>\u201cHey what\u2019s up Penis?\u201d Flash said, answering my question. I felt Peter stiffen slightly. \u201cI was telling (Y/N) that I could drive her to school sometime. You know\u2026\u201d</p><p>Flash continued to taIk and I pulled away to look at Peter. He looked irritated but otherwise fine. I rolled my eyes as he droned on behind us. </p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t get lost,\u201d Peter murmured quietly as he smirked down at me. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah, well. I had MJ,\u201d I said. I was definitely beginning to feel buzzed. </p><p>\u201cHey, Penis,\u201d Flash said behind us. \u201cWhat\u2019s it like wiping Tony Stark\u2019s ass everyday?\u201d</p><p>I abruptly turned around. </p><p>\u201cOh my God, Flash. Are you <i>still</i> here?\u201d I asked looking him up and down. \u201cIsn\u2019t there somewhere else you can be insecure about your dick size?\u201d </p><p>Flash looked more surprised than offended by what I said, but nonetheless stalked out of the kitchen. </p><p>\u201cYikes, that was a little harsh, (Y/N),\u201d Ned said. He was standing next to Peter, who was smiling ear to ear. </p><p>\u201cHi, Ned. Nice hat,\u201d I said finishing off my drink. I let out a rasping breath, almost expecting fire to come out of my mouth. \u201cAnd, yeah. Probably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, even Ned thinks you were harsh,\u201d MJ said, offering me another gherkin. I accepted. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll get over it,\u201d Peter said, still grinning. </p><p>\u201cI need another drink and you two don\u2019t have one,\u201d I said looking back and forth between Ned and Peter. \u201cAnd I only have two hands, do-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you!\u201d Ned blurted. </p><p>Peter glanced over at him and Ned nodded at him. I furrowed my eyebrows and looked between my three friends. MJ was looking at Ned the same way Peter was; the only difference being that Peter was rapidly turning pink. </p><p>Ned and I made our way to the drink table and I smiled at his excitement. </p><p>\u201cAre you\u2026?\u201d I asked holding up a bottle of clear alcohol. He shook his head. \u201cDo you think Peter\u2026?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t say no before we left so\u2026\u201d </p><p>I smiled and made Peter a weak drink. </p><p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Ned started. \u201cYou and Peter\u2026\u201d</p><p>I froze and felt my cheeks begin to get warm. </p><p>\u201cDid Peter put you up to this?\u201d I asked as I handed him a soda. Ned didn\u2019t have a good poker face but he didn\u2019t say anything else. I smiled. \u201cC\u2019mon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do you\u2026 ya know\u2026?\u201d Ned asked as we walked back into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to be more specific,\u201d I said as I turned around and quickly walked straight to Peter and handed him his drink. \u201cNed and I just had a very interesting conversation, Peter.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes widened into his drink and he quickly brought the cup to his mouth and took a gulp- one that he obviously regretted. He made a face similar to the one that I made every time I took a sip of my drink. </p><p>\u201cI assume it was, I can\u2019t really remember,\u201d I said glancing at Ned out of the corner of my eye. He visibly relaxed. </p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t remember? How much have you had to drink? Or, uh, how long have you been here?\u201d Peter asked as he set his drink down on the counter. I look another large sip. </p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d I said through a grimace. \u201cDo you know what the term \u2018light-weight\u2019 means?\u201d</p><p>MJ and Peter chuckled as I took another sip that burned less than the first drink did. I had a feeling that tonight was going to be a good night. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>The subway was pretty empty, so Peter and I were able to sit this time. Ned sat across from us and MJ was standing. She had to change trains before any of our stops. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you Sunday,\u201d she said. We were holding pinkies in my semi-drunken state. \u201cAnd please get home safe you fuckin\u2019 dork.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes and smiled at her.</p><p>\u201cI looove you, MJ,\u201d I said as the train pulled to a stop. </p><p>\u201cEw.\u201d</p><p>She stepped off the train. </p><p>\u201cI LOVE YOU!\u201d I yelled after her. </p><p>\u201cI DON\u2019T KNOW YOU!\u201d</p><p>The doors closed and my butt vibrated as the train began to take off. I had to squint at my phone because I was maybe a little too drunk to read. </p><p>MJ: love you too. </p><p>Ned got off at the next stop and as soon as the train took off I laid my head on Peter\u2019s shoulder. </p><p>\u201cDo you know which stop you are?\u201d he asked. I squinted up at the subway map. </p><p>\u201cIf I say no does that mean you\u2019ll walk me home?\u201d I asked. He chuckled. </p><p>\u201cTo the side walk?\u201d </p><p>I felt my heart start to pick up the pace. </p><p>\u201cUh, actually. Do you want to maybe watch that crime documentary?\u201d I asked nervously. Peter looked down at me and I shifted to look up at him. He had a smile tugging at the corner of his mouth and he arched an eyebrow at me. \u201cOnly if you want to though, I wouldn\u2019t want-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI want to,\u201d he said. I broke a smile and he smiled back down at me. \u201cAlso, the next stop is yours.\u201d</p><p>He stood up and held his hand out to help me up. I graciously accepted. Normally I would have immediately let go of his hand but in my emboldened state I entwined my fingers in his as we walked towards the doors. He squeezed my hand as we stepped off the train. </p><p>The walk to my apartment was comfortably quiet. Every now and then, one of us would comment about our immediate surroundings but we didn\u2019t speak any further than that. </p><p>My mind was racing. Well, as much as it could run with the amount of alcohol it was handling. </p><p><i>We\u2019re just going to watch people murdering each other. Do not set any expectations for this, (Y/N). </i></p><p>But I couldn\u2019t help but let my mind wander. I imagined his lips on mine; what they would feel like on mine, if they\u2019d be soft. I glanced at him, trying to determine if he had chapped lips or not. He noticed. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he said using his other hand to wipe his upper lip. \u201cDo I have a pimple or something?\u201d </p><p>I shook my head and looked away. We walked further down the block and I almost had my arm ripped out of the socket when I walked past Peter. I turned to look back at him irritably. He had a very smug look on his face and he simply pointed at the building in front of us. </p><p>Which was my building. </p><p>\u201cHow drunk are you?\u201d he asked as I opened the door and walked to the elevator. There was a maintenance sign taped to it, indicating it was not functional. </p><p>\u201cOof. Too drunk to take the fuckin\u2019 stairs that is fo\u2019 sho.\u201d</p><p><i>Fo\u2019 sho\u2019? The fuck was that?</i></p><p>Suddenly, I wasn\u2019t on my feet anymore: Peter had scooped me up in his arms and was already carrying me up the stairs. </p><p>\u201cPeter! Stop, it\u2019s- I live on the fifth floor,\u201d I said wrapping my arms around his neck. </p><p>\u201cShut up, its fine,\u201d he responded. His voice was surprisingly even, and as we started up the second flight of stairs he didn\u2019t even break a sweat. </p><p>On the fifth floor, Peter set me down and I let us into my apartment. I gave Peter the remote and I retreated to my room so I could change. Staring in the mirror, I took a couple deep breaths. </p><p><i>No expectations. </i></p><p>Peter was playing a game on his phone when I walked out into the living room. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in my spot,\u201d I teased as I sat next to him and curled my feet under me. </p><p>He chuckled and started the episode. The alcohol was making me feel brave, so I scooted closer to him and laid my head on his shoulder. He stiffened for the briefest moment before he shifted and around put his arm around my shoulder. </p><p>Peter began to run his fingers through my hair and I leaned against his hand, inviting him to continue. I took the hem of his shirt and began to roll the seam in my finger tips. It started to get harder to keep my eyes open and I felt myself drifting off. </p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d I mumbled. He hummed at me. \u201cI want to lay down.\u201d</p><p>I began to sit up so I could go to my bedroom but Peter shifted around so I could lay against his chest along the couch and still watch the show. I smiled as I listened to his heart beat and began to match my breathing to his. I could tell I was about to fall asleep as Peter continued to play with my hair.</p><p>\u201cPeter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said as I let my eyes close. </p><p>\u201cFor?\u201d he asked shifted a little. His cheek was now pressed into the top of my head. </p><p>The best I could respond with was a hum as I began to drift out of consciousness and into the world of sleep. \u00a0</p></p>",

I&rsquo;d finished five minutes ago but I was going back over every single answer. There was one question that I wasn&rsquo;t sure about. I specifically remembered Peter explaining how to do this problem but I couldn&rsquo;t remember whether the explanation contained &lsquo;<i>do</i>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<i>do not</i>.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck it,&rdquo; I mumbled under my breath as I boxed in my answer and stood up. </p><p>I wasn&rsquo;t the first one done but normally I was the last one finished so a lot of people turned to look at me. I kept my eyes on the clock as I marched up to my teacher&rsquo;s desk. He looked at me over his glasses like a hawk watching a mouse. </p><p>&ldquo;Ms. (Y/L/N),&rdquo; he muttered as he took my test from my hand. &ldquo;Are you sure you don&rsquo;t want to check your answers again?&rdquo; </p><p><i>I&rsquo;ll check my answers up your butt. </i></p><p>I shook my head and marched out of the classroom. It was mid passing period when I got to my locker and I had to elbow my way through people that had no spacial awareness. I winced as my locker door bounced off my head with a clang and gave the guy next to me a dirty look. Luckily for him the hallway began to clear out before I could hurt him and make it look like an accident. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; someone said from behind me. I glanced over my shoulder to see Peter nervously gripping the straps of his backpack. &ldquo;How&rsquo;d the test go?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There was only one that tripped me up!&rdquo; I said excitedly. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t thank you enough!&rdquo;</p><p>I threw my arms around his neck and this time he hugged me back immediately. He lifted me off the ground as he hugged me tighter in a bone crushing hug. I laughed as he set me back down. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, guys.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter and I jumped away from each other to see MJ and Ned standing next to each other. Both of them had the same stupid shit eating grin plastered across their faces. Before I could say anything Peter began to stammer out what he must have thought sounded like an explanation. I elbowed him in the side and he immediately shut his mouth. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey MJ, Ned&hellip;&rdquo; I started. &ldquo;Uh&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d the math test go?&rdquo; MJ asked, leaning against the lockers. </p><p>&ldquo;I think I did really well,&rdquo; I said turning to close my locker. &ldquo;Peter was just congratulating me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Looks like more than congratulating&hellip;&rdquo; MJ muttered next to my ear. </p><p>&ldquo;So are you guys excited about the&hellip;&rdquo; Ned trailed off and dramatically looked up and down the hallway. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>the party</i>?&rdquo; he whispered. I laughed as MJ and Peter stared at him. </p><p>The bell rang before I could respond to Ned and MJ and I left Ned and Peter standing at my locker and I could feel her judgement bubbling inside her.</p><p>&ldquo;So&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wanna talk about it,&rdquo; I muttered, making her grin even wider. </p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>MJ and I walked up the stairs to Betty&rsquo;s house and stood at the front door. </p><p>&ldquo;Just how loaded do we think Betty&rsquo;s parents are?&rdquo; I asked MJ, still looking up at the house. </p><p>&ldquo;A three story home in one of the most expensive neighborhoods in Brooklyn?&rdquo; MJ replied, also looking up at the house. &ldquo;You wanna ask? If I ask it&rsquo;ll be without- what was is you said- tact?&rdquo;</p><p>I snorted as she opened the door and I followed her in. The house was bursting at the seams with students from Midtown; half of which were drunk and half of which were stoned. As soon as we crossed the threshold, I immediately regretted coming to this party. &nbsp;</p><p>MJ&rsquo;s hand was already around my wrist. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m here, you&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; she muttered out of the corner of her mouth as she waved at someone across the room. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just stay until Peter and Ned get here and then we can leave.&rdquo;</p><p>I yanked my arm from her and grudgingly sighed. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go get us something to drink,&rdquo; I said as MJ <i>lovingly</i> flipped me off before strutting into the kitchen. </p><p>I sighed and squeezed in between drunken teenagers until I was standing in front of a drink table that had been heavily looted. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw someone slide up next to me</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, (Y/L/N)?&rdquo; </p><p>I turned to see Flash leaning against the drink table. He was looking at me with what I could only describe as dull bedroom eyes. Creepy, dull bedroom eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;Uh. Hey, Flash, &rdquo; I said as I turned around to go find MJ. </p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t usually come out to parties,&rdquo; Flash said, following me (unfortunately.) &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to see you out living life instead of cooped up studying with Penis Parker.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that supposed to mean?&rdquo; I asked over my shoulder. Flash was generally annoying but right now he was being <i>exceptionally</i> annoying. </p><p>I finally spotted MJ-eating gherkins from the jar- standing at Betty&rsquo;s kitchen counter. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, ya know,&rdquo; he said, still following me. &ldquo;One of the cutest girls in Academic Decathlon hanging out with one of the weirdest dudes&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh,&rdquo; I was a little lost for words. </p><p>I passed MJ her drink and widened my eyes at her in a non verbal &lsquo;yikes.&rsquo; She didn&rsquo;t respond but held a gherkin out on the end of her fork and I rolled my eyes before accepting and letting her feed it to me. </p><p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rsquo; Flash said leaning against the counter next to me. &ldquo;I heard Penis was helping you study for the calc test, which is weird because he&rsquo;s not even in our class.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call him that,&rdquo; I said taking a sip of my drink and grimacing as it burnt my throat. &ldquo;And does it matter who I study calc with?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure I have a better grade in calc-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah fuckin&rsquo; right, Flash,&rdquo; MJ said crunching on a pickle. </p><p>Flash looked a little dejected but obviously MJ and I were going to have to be meaner to him if we wanted him to leave us alone. </p><p>&ldquo;Anyway, (Y/N), you take the bus right?&rdquo; he asked. </p><p>&ldquo;I used to. I take the subway now,&rdquo; I said taking another sip and grimacing. <i>Why is everyone so concerned with my method of commute?</i></p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Flash said sliding closer to me along the counter. I glanced at MJ who looked away with a nonverbal &lsquo;oof.&rsquo; Flash&rsquo;s hip bumped mine and he put his arm over my shoulders. &ldquo;I happen to have a car and if you ever want a ride to school&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>I glanced at the floor before taking a large gulp of my drink- followed by a grimace. Flash wouldn&rsquo;t shut up and I really wanted to stab him with the fork MJ was using but decided to just drink more. And grimace more. </p><p>I heard someone say my name as I took another sip of my drink. I looked up to see Peter standing in front of me, and I felt butterflies in my stomach. He was looking at Flash like he was going to break his arm, and it was&hellip; kind of a turn on?</p><p>&ldquo;Peter!&rdquo; I gasped. I threw Flash&rsquo;s arm off and grabbed Peter around the neck.

I squinted up at the subway map. </p><p>&ldquo;If I say no does that mean you&rsquo;ll walk me home?&rdquo; I asked.

Do you want to maybe watch that crime documentary?&rdquo; I asked nervously. Peter looked down at me and I shifted to look up at him. He had a smile tugging at the corner of his mouth and he arched an eyebrow at me. &ldquo;Only if you want to though, I wouldn&rsquo;t want-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I want to,&rdquo; he said. I broke a smile and he smiled back down at me. &ldquo;Also, the next stop is yours.&rdquo;</p><p>He stood up and held his hand out to help me up. I graciously accepted.

I smiled as I listened to his heart beat and began to match my breathing to his. I could tell I was about to fall asleep as Peter continued to play with my hair.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hm?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; I said as I let my eyes close. </p><p>&ldquo;For?&rdquo; he asked shifted a little. His cheek was now pressed into the top of my head. </p><p>The best I could respond with was a hum as I began to drift out of consciousness and into the world of sleep. &nbsp;</p></p>",

We\u2019ll keep an eye out, if she turns up again we\u2019ll find her.\u201d Sam told him, point in the opposite direction. \u201cSchool. Now.\u201d</p><p>    Peter rolled his eyes as he turned and started back down the way he had originally been going, his shoulders slumped. He couldn\u2019t wait to graduate, that way he focus more of his time doing things to help people. </p><p>\u2014\u2014-</p><p>     I kept running, dodging around people, trying to get away. I didn\u2019t bother to look behind me, this was crazy, there was no way I was in the future by four years. The kid had to have been messing with me, after all finding a woman half dead in the middle of the street would of been an easy target. </p><p>    Then you factor in Ice man and Warm man, which seemed to have come out of no where. They all knew each other, maybe some kind of street gang, blue eyes would certainly have been the muscle. The kid, maybe a runner? Maybe he was the one that kept his feelers out, would of made sense for him to call his bosses. Mocha man, definitely the smarter of the three, he was the brains. </p><p>    Who knew if there was more, they could be on every street corner for all I knew. I slowed down, putting as many streets and turns between me and them as possible. I looked over my shoulder, to my surprise I didn\u2019t see anyone. Well, I saw lots of people but not them. </p><p>    As I started to walk past one of the many street corner vendors I saw a newspaper paper stand and the headline on the New York Times cause me to pause. Post Snap, Five Years After Thanos. Post snap? Isn\u2019t that what the kid said? And what was Thanos? </p><p>    \"How much for the paper?\u201d I questioned the older woman sitting behind the table. </p><p>    \u201cTwo dollars.\u201d She replied, not bothering to look up, I pulled my wallet out of my back pocket and handed my debt card over. I opened the paper as I waited for her to swipe my card. </p><p>    The year 2018 an alien being dusted half the population? Half of everything living gone within seconds, and then a couple months ago people who called themselves the Avengers..</p><p>    \u201cMiss, your card is declining, do you have another form of payment?\u201d She asked, interrupting me. I looked up at her a blinked hard a couple of times, how? I literally just got paid yesterday. </p><p>    \u201cUh..\u201d I opened my wallet and just like any other day of my life it was void of any actual cash. \u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 She handed the card back to me as I started to walk away leaving the paper on the counter top. 2018 was last year, those events didn\u2019t happen, the date on the paper though said it was 2023. I don\u2019t understand, how could possibly be four years in the future and the events of last year change?</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I stopped at the street corner and looked around, my brain refusing to process the very real possibility that some how I was in alternate reality. An alternate world in which the world had been attacked by some alien creature, or creatures just as my vision had shown before I ran into the theater bathroom. How it happened, I have no idea, I didn\u2019t pay much attention to the possibility of timelines and realities that ran side by side. But the very little knowledge I did have would make more since that the years should run side by side. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Unless somehow in this world if there was a me, which could be a possibility, somehow got swapped with the me from my world. Or, there was a secret black hole in the bathroom that I just happened to stumble upon. All I knew is none of this made any sense, it was time to do some research though. Time to make some sense of the events that were surrounding me. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Peter watched the clock on the wall in his last period. He hadn\u2019t been able to get the woman\u2019s face out of his head, the look of shock and fear. Her genuine confusion about the snap, those who came back from the snap were always confused but she seemed more so then most.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 She had said Spiderling, Tony had called him that in his bed room when they first met, right before asking him to go Germany to help fight against Captain America and his team. Nobody knew that, and until she said it he had all forgotten about it as well. Maybe she knew Tony somehow, if she was snapped then she wouldn\u2019t know that Tony was\u2026.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 Peter wiped his cheek, looking down from the clock and took a deep breath. He needed to find her again, he knew that Sam and Bucky didn\u2019t seemed concerned by her but something in his gut told him there was something different about this woman.</p><p>Permanent tag-</p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mn7eADoI3PbFkcF5i8NNiMg\">@kitkatkl</a>  <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3pwQ3Sa9HHZZZPO2oMQxRA\">@octobermermaid</a>  <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBb4kX5ZjREpJq2bNqumg4g\">@ajosieface</a>  <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7EFQI6lHWS1ZwHZdiIXJfQ\">@instantnoodlese</a>  <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqGTICsv6wXfWuI8gQZrhqQ\">@crystlblu</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbMjLzeZOiw097UfkLMIxIw\">@coffeebooksandfandom</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbzINLfv17mQRDzuIowmuaA\">@thisismysecrethappyplace</a>  <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/miOmMdBBsBXQDxINdiEuFgA\">@the-wayward-robot</a>  <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjODeju786UG9mCRpAMNAhg\">@lokilvrr</a>  <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwGSKhEKHC4g-VdlD6iIfTw\">@shynara51</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mERPNKUZ_DD3ohh85VOAaZg\">@fourtyninekirbygamzeegirl</a>  <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqv_vPGfW7ku4vXHT4hTDeg\">@loislp</a> @savedbyimagination  @bubblycypres87 @ifyousayyouloveme <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJ0-jvGmBO-1VNvMaDkulUQ\">@courtmr</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg56k_2FibG8BBT9bI5coPg\">@blue-cat-1989</a> </p><p><br></p><p>Secret World tag-</p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMRUaORsBM8o12fT5z4v1hA\">@devilbat</a> t  @no-regrets-just-confusion <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCvLjrlFsgjZIWG37uEn5qQ\">@neverseenaspaceshipbefore</a>  <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_6XslUogsbI1BXEHFFyuYA\">@silverhart93</a> </p></p>",

See when you fall asleep. Do you dream? Is it the nightmares that you imagine? Is it someone&hellip;someone you love perhaps, someone you lost? A friend, a best friend, or is it a lover?</p><p>Days upon days you drudged around the Avengers compound with a blanket wrapped tightly around your shoulders. All the energy you could possibly have was drained right out of you. You didn\u2019t want to do anything anymore. You simply allowed yourself to let the tiredness take over your whole body. Everyone was worried about you, but then again they understood the circumstances. They\u2019ve all lost someone they\u2019ve deeply cared about, so watching you break down and isolate\u00a0yourself was something they could relate to. Losing a loved one was never easy.</p><p><i>\u201cYou should eat something.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWe should go out and do something.\u201d<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cYou can\u2019t stay in bed forever kiddo.\u201d</i><br/></p><p><i>\u201cI miss him too ya know.\u201d<br/></i></p><!-- more --><p>Everyone\u2019s words echoing in your head. It was as though it was constantly on replay. You knew how hard they were trying to made you feel anything else other than pain.</p><p>As much as you didn\u2019t want to admit it. You could feel yourself losing. Losing yourself to the tragedy that occurred. That\u2019s all your mind wandered off to. That night&hellip;the night you lost him. Peter. It was driving you to insanity, and you couldn\u2019t stop thinking about him. Thinking about the way you lost him&hellip;the way you couldn\u2019t save him.\u00a0<br/><br/><i>There&rsquo;s an old voice in my head that&rsquo;s holding me back</i><br/><i>Well, tell her that I miss our little talks</i><br/><i>Soon it will be over and buried with our past</i><br/><i>We used to play outside when we were young, and full of life and full of love</i></p><p>The sleepless nights began around a couple months after the snap. After Thanos snapped away 50 percent of all living creatures. Taking your boyfriend in the process. You couldn\u2019t fall under. Too scared of what you might see. If you slept you dreamt&hellip;and if you dreamt, you thought of him. You saw him.\u00a0<br/><br/><i>Some days, I don&rsquo;t know if I am wrong or right</i><br/><i>Your mind is playing tricks on you, my dear</i><br/><i>Cause though the truth may vary, this ship will carry our</i><br/><i>Bodies safe to shore</i></p><p>The nightmares didn\u2019t help your cause. They differentiated from the dreams you had of Peter. When you had dreams, you were happy. Like that small part of him, that you held onto was still there. <i>He </i>was there. There with you. He wasn\u2019t gone, he didn\u2019t stop existing. He wasn\u2019t wiped off the face of the earth. He was just there and he was there with you. He didn\u2019t leave you. However, when the nightmares kicked into place. You woke up in cold sweats, your breathing was uneven. The fear that was in his voice when he felt the effect of the snap echoing in your head. Reminding you that you couldn\u2019t prevent him from disintegrating. Your own voice crying out for him. You couldn\u2019t move in this nightmare, you couldn\u2019t reach out for him. You could only watch. Then he\u2019d disappear and you\u2019d wake up. Although you knew the nightmares were bad, you couldn\u2019t help but think your dreams overpowered them.<br/><br/><i>Hey! Don&rsquo;t listen to a word I say</i><br/><i>Hey! The screams all sound the same</i><br/><i>Hey! Though the truth may vary, this ship will carry our</i><br/><i>Bodies safe to shore</i></p><p>You woke up in a gasp. Your hair sticking to your face. Your chest was heaving up and down. You placed a hand on your chest trying to control your breathing. It wasn\u2019t working. You whimpered as it got too hard. The body next to you shifting. Peter opened his eyes quickly and sat up full alert this time.</p><p>\u201cY/n?\u201d Peter realized too quickly just how bad this was. He sat up on his knees pushing the blanket off him.\u00a0\u201cHey, hey. You\u2019re okay, you\u2019re okay. It was just a dream, just a dream okay.\u201d Peter cooed at you trying to soothe you down.</p><p>\u201cI-it felt real.\u201d You mumbled. Your eyes were still watery from the sudden jolt you did when you woke up.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt was just a dream. Whatever it was it can\u2019t harm you anymore.\u201d Peter wrapped his arm around you bring you closer to his chest. He pecked your head as he rubbed soothing circles on your back. \u201cD-Do you want to talk about it?\u201d He looked down at you.</p><p>You shook your head no.</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s talk about something else then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cL-Like what?\u201d You muttered.</p><p>\u201cLike&hellip;like that new upgrade we need to get for your suit.\u201d Peter shrugged.</p><p>\u201cIt does not need a new-\u201d You stopped yourself short.\u00a0\u201cOkay, maybe it needs a few tweaks.\u201d You laughed quietly.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d Peter got off the bed and knelt down at the edge looking up at you with the most boyish smile you thought he could possibly muster.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d You chuckled.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Y/n. Come on.\u201d He kept repeating.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d He smiled up at you.\u00a0\u201cCome on.\u201d<br/><br/><i>Hey!</i><br/><i>Hey!</i><br/><i>Hey!</i></p><p>You sat up quickly gasping at the rush the dream gave you. You placed a hand on your chest. You gaze suddenly averting to your left side. Your other hand reaching out to feel the trace of the cold sheets. Then you looked at the edge of the bed.\u00a0</p><p>Peter wasn\u2019t there.\u00a0</p><p>You sighed heavily as you realized that you were only imagining all of it. You closed your eyes wanting a chance. Any chance of seeing him again.\u00a0</p><p>One more glimpse of him.</p><p>One more.</p><p>You laid back down and made yourself comfortable. You tugged the blanket up to your neck and turned on your side. The side of that faced his. You closed your eyes and let sleep take over. You were lulled into another dream. A dream about Peter.<br/><br/><i>You&rsquo;re gone, gone, gone away; I watched you disappear</i><br/><i>All that&rsquo;s left is a ghost of you</i><br/><i>Now we&rsquo;re torn, torn, torn apart; there&rsquo;s nothing we can do</i><br/><i>Just let me go, we&rsquo;ll meet again soon</i><br/><br/><i>Now wait, wait, wait for me; please hang around</i><br/><i>I&rsquo;ll see you when I fall asleep\u2026</i><br/></p><hr><p><b></b></p><p><b>*Permanent Tag (Multiple Stories):</b></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIPaO3Q7cOuzNuRoVObPC2A\"

It was as though it was constantly on replay. You knew how hard they were trying to made you feel anything else other than pain.</p><p>As much as you didn\u2019t want to admit it. You could feel yourself losing. Losing yourself to the tragedy that occurred. That\u2019s all your mind wandered off to. That night\u2026the night you lost him. Peter. It was driving you to insanity, and you couldn\u2019t stop thinking about him. Thinking about the way you lost him\u2026the way you couldn\u2019t save him.\u00a0<br><br><i>There\u2019s an old voice in my head that\u2019s holding me back</i><br><i>Well, tell her that I miss our little talks</i><br><i>Soon it will be over and buried with our past</i><br><i>We used to play outside when we were young, and full of life and full of love</i></p><p>The sleepless nights began around a couple months after the snap. After Thanos snapped away 50 percent of all living creatures. Taking your boyfriend in the process. You couldn\u2019t fall under. Too scared of what you might see. If you slept you dreamt\u2026and if you dreamt, you thought of him. You saw him.\u00a0<br><br><i>Some days, I don\u2019t know if I am wrong or right</i><br><i>Your mind is playing tricks on you, my dear</i><br><i>Cause though the truth may vary, this ship will carry our</i><br><i>Bodies safe to shore</i></p><p>The nightmares didn\u2019t help your cause. They differentiated from the dreams you had of Peter. When you had dreams, you were happy. Like that small part of him, that you held onto was still there. <i>He </i>was there. There with you. He wasn\u2019t gone, he didn\u2019t stop existing. He wasn\u2019t wiped off the face of the earth. He was just there and he was there with you. He didn\u2019t leave you. However, when the nightmares kicked into place. You woke up in cold sweats, your breathing was uneven. The fear that was in his voice when he felt the effect of the snap echoing in your head. Reminding you that you couldn\u2019t prevent him from disintegrating. Your own voice crying out for him. You couldn\u2019t move in this nightmare, you couldn\u2019t reach out for him. You could only watch. Then he\u2019d disappear and you\u2019d wake up. Although you knew the nightmares were bad, you couldn\u2019t help but think your dreams overpowered them.<br><br><i>Hey! Don\u2019t listen to a word I say</i><br><i>Hey! The screams all sound the same</i><br><i>Hey! Though the truth may vary, this ship will carry our</i><br><i>Bodies safe to shore</i></p><p>You woke up in a gasp. Your hair sticking to your face. Your chest was heaving up and down. You placed a hand on your chest trying to control your breathing. It wasn\u2019t working. You whimpered as it got too hard. The body next to you shifting. Peter opened his eyes quickly and sat up full alert this time.</p><p>\u201cY/n?\u201d Peter realized too quickly just how bad this was. He sat up on his knees pushing the blanket off him.\u00a0\u201cHey, hey. You\u2019re okay, you\u2019re okay. It was just a dream, just a dream okay.\u201d Peter cooed at you trying to soothe you down.</p><p>\u201cI-it felt real.\u201d You mumbled. Your eyes were still watery from the sudden jolt you did when you woke up.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt was just a dream. Whatever it was it can\u2019t harm you anymore.\u201d Peter wrapped his arm around you bring you closer to his chest. He pecked your head as he rubbed soothing circles on your back. \u201cD-Do you want to talk about it?\u201d He looked down at you.</p><p>You shook your head no.</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s talk about something else then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cL-Like what?\u201d You muttered.</p><p>\u201cLike\u2026like that new upgrade we need to get for your suit.\u201d Peter shrugged.</p><p>\u201cIt does not need a new-\u201d You stopped yourself short.\u00a0\u201cOkay, maybe it needs a few tweaks.\u201d You laughed quietly.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d Peter got off the bed and knelt down at the edge looking up at you with the most boyish smile you thought he could possibly muster.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d You chuckled.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Y/n. Come on.\u201d He kept repeating.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d He smiled up at you.\u00a0\u201cCome on.\u201d<br><br><i>Hey!</i><br><i>Hey!</i><br><i>Hey!</i></p><p>You sat up quickly gasping at the rush the dream gave you. You placed a hand on your chest. You gaze suddenly averting to your left side. Your other hand reaching out to feel the trace of the cold sheets. Then you looked at the edge of the bed.\u00a0</p><p>Peter wasn\u2019t there.\u00a0</p><p>You sighed heavily as you realized that you were only imagining all of it. You closed your eyes wanting a chance. Any chance of seeing him again.\u00a0</p><p>One more glimpse of him.</p><p>One more.</p><p>You laid back down and made yourself comfortable. You tugged the blanket up to your neck and turned on your side. The side of that faced his. You closed your eyes and let sleep take over. You were lulled into another dream. A dream about Peter.<br><br><i>You\u2019re gone, gone, gone away; I watched you disappear</i><br><i>All that\u2019s left is a ghost of you</i><br><i>Now we\u2019re torn, torn, torn apart; there\u2019s nothing we can do</i><br><i>Just let me go, we\u2019ll meet again soon</i><br><br><i>Now wait, wait, wait for me; please hang around</i><br><i>I\u2019ll see you when I fall asleep\u2026</i><br></p><hr><p><b></b></p><p><b>*Permanent Tag (Multiple Stories):</b></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIPaO3Q7cOuzNuRoVObPC2A\"

See when you fall asleep. Do you dream? Is it the nightmares that you imagine? Is it someone\u2026someone you love perhaps, someone you lost? A friend, a best friend, or is it a lover?</p><p>Days upon days you drudged around the Avengers compound with a blanket wrapped tightly around your shoulders. All the energy you could possibly have was drained right out of you. You didn\u2019t want to do anything anymore. You simply allowed yourself to let the tiredness take over your whole body. Everyone was worried about you, but then again they understood the circumstances. They\u2019ve all lost someone they\u2019ve deeply cared about, so watching you break down and isolate\u00a0yourself was something they could relate to. Losing a loved one was never easy.</p><p><i>\u201cYou should eat something.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWe should go out and do something.\u201d<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cYou can\u2019t stay in bed forever kiddo.\u201d</i><br></p><p><i>\u201cI miss him too ya know.\u201d<br></i></p>[[MORE]]<p>Everyone\u2019s words echoing in your head. It was as though it was constantly on replay. You knew how hard they were trying to made you feel anything else other than pain.</p><p>As much as you didn\u2019t want to admit it. You could feel yourself losing. Losing yourself to the tragedy that occurred. That\u2019s all your mind wandered off to. That night\u2026the night you lost him. Peter. It was driving you to insanity, and you couldn\u2019t stop thinking about him. Thinking about the way you lost him\u2026the way you couldn\u2019t save him.\u00a0<br><br><i>There\u2019s an old voice in my head that\u2019s holding me back</i><br><i>Well, tell her that I miss our little talks</i><br><i>Soon it will be over and buried with our past</i><br><i>We used to play outside when we were young, and full of life and full of love</i></p><p>The sleepless nights began around a couple months after the snap. After Thanos snapped away 50 percent of all living creatures. Taking your boyfriend in the process. You couldn\u2019t fall under. Too scared of what you might see. If you slept you dreamt\u2026and if you dreamt, you thought of him. You saw him.\u00a0<br><br><i>Some days, I don\u2019t know if I am wrong or right</i><br><i>Your mind is playing tricks on you, my dear</i><br><i>Cause though the truth may vary, this ship will carry our</i><br><i>Bodies safe to shore</i></p><p>The nightmares didn\u2019t help your cause. They differentiated from the dreams you had of Peter. When you had dreams, you were happy. Like that small part of him, that you held onto was still there. <i>He </i>was there. There with you. He wasn\u2019t gone, he didn\u2019t stop existing. He wasn\u2019t wiped off the face of the earth. He was just there and he was there with you. He didn\u2019t leave you. However, when the nightmares kicked into place. You woke up in cold sweats, your breathing was uneven. The fear that was in his voice when he felt the effect of the snap echoing in your head. Reminding you that you couldn\u2019t prevent him from disintegrating. Your own voice crying out for him. You couldn\u2019t move in this nightmare, you couldn\u2019t reach out for him. You could only watch. Then he\u2019d disappear and you\u2019d wake up. Although you knew the nightmares were bad, you couldn\u2019t help but think your dreams overpowered them.<br><br><i>Hey! Don\u2019t listen to a word I say</i><br><i>Hey! The screams all sound the same</i><br><i>Hey! Though the truth may vary, this ship will carry our</i><br><i>Bodies safe to shore</i></p><p>You woke up in a gasp. Your hair sticking to your face. Your chest was heaving up and down. You placed a hand on your chest trying to control your breathing. It wasn\u2019t working. You whimpered as it got too hard. The body next to you shifting. Peter opened his eyes quickly and sat up full alert this time.</p><p>\u201cY/n?\u201d Peter realized too quickly just how bad this was. He sat up on his knees pushing the blanket off him.\u00a0\u201cHey, hey. You\u2019re okay, you\u2019re okay. It was just a dream, just a dream okay.\u201d Peter cooed at you trying to soothe you down.</p><p>\u201cI-it felt real.\u201d You mumbled. Your eyes were still watery from the sudden jolt you did when you woke up.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt was just a dream. Whatever it was it can\u2019t harm you anymore.\u201d Peter wrapped his arm around you bring you closer to his chest. He pecked your head as he rubbed soothing circles on your back. \u201cD-Do you want to talk about it?\u201d He looked down at you.</p><p>You shook your head no.</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s talk about something else then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cL-Like what?\u201d You muttered.</p><p>\u201cLike\u2026like that new upgrade we need to get for your suit.\u201d Peter shrugged.</p><p>\u201cIt does not need a new-\u201d You stopped yourself short.\u00a0\u201cOkay, maybe it needs a few tweaks.\u201d You laughed quietly.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d Peter got off the bed and knelt down at the edge looking up at you with the most boyish smile you thought he could possibly muster.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d You chuckled.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Y/n. Come on.\u201d He kept repeating.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d He smiled up at you.\u00a0\u201cCome on.\u201d<br><br><i>Hey!</i><br><i>Hey!</i><br><i>Hey!</i></p><p>You sat up quickly gasping at the rush the dream gave you. You placed a hand on your chest. You gaze suddenly averting to your left side. Your other hand reaching out to feel the trace of the cold sheets. Then you looked at the edge of the bed.\u00a0</p><p>Peter wasn\u2019t there.\u00a0</p><p>You sighed heavily as you realized that you were only imagining all of it. You closed your eyes wanting a chance. Any chance of seeing him again.\u00a0</p><p>One more glimpse of him.</p><p>One more.</p><p>You laid back down and made yourself comfortable. You tugged the blanket up to your neck and turned on your side. The side of that faced his. You closed your eyes and let sleep take over. You were lulled into another dream. A dream about Peter.<br><br><i>You\u2019re gone, gone, gone away; I watched you disappear</i><br><i>All that\u2019s left is a ghost of you</i><br><i>Now we\u2019re torn, torn, torn apart; there\u2019s

See when you fall asleep. Do you dream? Is it the nightmares that you imagine? Is it someone&hellip;someone you love perhaps, someone you lost? A friend, a best friend, or is it a lover?</p><p>Days upon days you drudged around the Avengers compound with a blanket wrapped tightly around your shoulders. All the energy you could possibly have was drained right out of you. You didn&rsquo;t want to do anything anymore. You simply allowed yourself to let the tiredness take over your whole body. Everyone was worried about you, but then again they understood the circumstances. They&rsquo;ve all lost someone they&rsquo;ve deeply cared about, so watching you break down and isolate&nbsp;yourself was something they could relate to. Losing a loved one was never easy.</p><p><i>&ldquo;You should eat something.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;We should go out and do something.&rdquo;<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t stay in bed forever kiddo.&rdquo;</i><br /></p><p><i>&ldquo;I miss him too ya know.&rdquo;<br /></i></p><p>Everyone&rsquo;s words echoing in your head. It was as though it was constantly on replay. You knew how hard they were trying to made you feel anything else other than pain.</p><p>As much as you didn&rsquo;t want to admit it. You could feel yourself losing. Losing yourself to the tragedy that occurred. That&rsquo;s all your mind wandered off to. That night&hellip;the night you lost him. Peter. It was driving you to insanity, and you couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about him. Thinking about the way you lost him&hellip;the way you couldn&rsquo;t save him.&nbsp;<br /><br /><i>There&rsquo;s an old voice in my head that&rsquo;s holding me back</i><br /><i>Well, tell her that I miss our little talks</i><br /><i>Soon it will be over and buried with our past</i><br /><i>We used to play outside when we were young, and full of life and full of love</i></p><p>The sleepless nights began around a couple months after the snap. After Thanos snapped away 50 percent of all living creatures. Taking your boyfriend in the process. You couldn&rsquo;t fall under. Too scared of what you might see. If you slept you dreamt&hellip;and if you dreamt, you thought of him. You saw him.&nbsp;<br /><br /><i>Some days, I don&rsquo;t know if I am wrong or right</i><br /><i>Your mind is playing tricks on you, my dear</i><br /><i>Cause though the truth may vary, this ship will carry our</i><br /><i>Bodies safe to shore</i></p><p>The nightmares didn&rsquo;t help your cause. They differentiated from the dreams you had of Peter. When you had dreams, you were happy. Like that small part of him, that you held onto was still there. <i>He </i>was there. There with you. He wasn&rsquo;t gone, he didn&rsquo;t stop existing. He wasn&rsquo;t wiped off the face of the earth. He was just there and he was there with you. He didn&rsquo;t leave you. However, when the nightmares kicked into place. You woke up in cold sweats, your breathing was uneven. The fear that was in his voice when he felt the effect of the snap echoing in your head. Reminding you that you couldn&rsquo;t prevent him from disintegrating. Your own voice crying out for him. You couldn&rsquo;t move in this nightmare, you couldn&rsquo;t reach out for him. You could only watch. Then he&rsquo;d disappear and you&rsquo;d wake up. Although you knew the nightmares were bad, you couldn&rsquo;t help but think your dreams overpowered them.<br /><br /><i>Hey! Don&rsquo;t listen to a word I say</i><br /><i>Hey! The screams all sound the same</i><br /><i>Hey! Though the truth may vary, this ship will carry our</i><br /><i>Bodies safe to shore</i></p><p>You woke up in a gasp. Your hair sticking to your face. Your chest was heaving up and down. You placed a hand on your chest trying to control your breathing. It wasn&rsquo;t working. You whimpered as it got too hard. The body next to you shifting. Peter opened his eyes quickly and sat up full alert this time.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/n?&rdquo; Peter realized too quickly just how bad this was. He sat up on his knees pushing the blanket off him.&nbsp;&ldquo;Hey, hey. You&rsquo;re okay, you&rsquo;re okay. It was just a dream, just a dream okay.&rdquo; Peter cooed at you trying to soothe you down.</p><p>&ldquo;I-it felt real.&rdquo; You mumbled. Your eyes were still watery from the sudden jolt you did when you woke up.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It was just a dream. Whatever it was it can&rsquo;t harm you anymore.&rdquo; Peter wrapped his arm around you bring you closer to his chest. He pecked your head as he rubbed soothing circles on your back. &ldquo;D-Do you want to talk about it?&rdquo; He looked down at you.</p><p>You shook your head no.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, let&rsquo;s talk about something else then.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;L-Like what?&rdquo; You muttered.</p><p>&ldquo;Like&hellip;like that new upgrade we need to get for your suit.&rdquo; Peter shrugged.</p><p>&ldquo;It does not need a new-&rdquo; You stopped yourself short.&nbsp;&ldquo;Okay, maybe it needs a few tweaks.&rdquo; You laughed quietly.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on.&rdquo; Peter got off the bed and knelt down at the edge looking up at you with the most boyish smile you thought he could possibly muster.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; You chuckled.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, Y/n. Come on.&rdquo; He kept repeating.</p><p>&ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Come on.&rdquo; He smiled up at you.&nbsp;&ldquo;Come on.&rdquo;<br /><br /><i>Hey!</i><br /><i>Hey!</i><br /><i>Hey!</i></p><p>You sat up quickly gasping at the rush the dream gave you. You placed a hand on your chest. You gaze suddenly averting to your left side. Your other hand reaching out to feel the trace of the cold sheets. Then you looked at the edge of the bed.&nbsp;</p><p>Peter wasn&rsquo;t there.&nbsp;</p><p>You sighed heavily as you realized that you were only imagining all of it. You closed your eyes wanting a chance. Any chance of seeing him again.&nbsp;</p><p>One more glimpse of him.</p><p>One more.</p><p>You laid back down and made yourself comfortable. You tugged the blanket up to your neck and turned on your side. The side of that faced his. You closed your eyes and let sleep take over. You were lulled into another dream. A dream about Peter.<br /><br /><i>You&rsquo;re gone, gone, gone away; I watched you disappear</i><br /><i>All that&rsquo;s left is a ghost of you</i><br /><i>Now we&rsquo;re torn, torn, torn apart; there&rsquo;s nothing we can do</i><br /><i>Just let me go, we&rsquo;ll meet again soon</i><br /><br /><i>Now wait, wait, wait for me; please hang around</i><br /><i>I&rsquo;ll see you when I fall asleep&hellip;</i><br /></p><hr /><p><b></b></p><p><b>*Permanent Tag (Multiple Stories):</b></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIPaO3Q7cOuzNuRoVObPC2A\" target=\"_blank\">@siennarossi</a>&#8203;&#8203;

All the energy you could possibly have was drained right out of you. You didn&rsquo;t want to do anything anymore. You simply allowed yourself to let the tiredness take over your whole body. Everyone was worried about you, but then again they understood the circumstances. They&rsquo;ve all lost someone they&rsquo;ve deeply cared about, so watching you break down and isolate&nbsp;yourself was something they could relate to.

The cold, suffocating dark goes on forever and we are alone. Live our lives, lacking anything better to do. Devise reason later. Born from oblivion; bear children, hell-bound as ourselves, go into oblivion. There is nothing else. Existence is random. Has no pattern save what we imagine after staring at it for too long. No meaning save what we choose to impose. This rudderless world is not shaped by vague metaphysical forces. It is not God who kills the children. Not fate that butchers them or destiny that feeds them to the dogs. It\u2019s us. Only us. Streets stank of fire. The void breathed hard on my heart, turning its illusions to ice, shattering them. Was reborn then, free to scrawl own design on this morally blank world.\"\n<br>- - - Rorschach; Watchmen by Alan Moore",

I don\u2019t know if any of you guys even thought about it, but that woman that was mentioned in the first fic, Jessica, just so happens to be one of my favorite Marvel characters, Jessica Jones. I just thought I\u2019d let you know before we jump into the story. And I think I\u2019m gonna turn this into a series. Let me know if I should. As usual, don\u2019t be afraid to send in requests and I would love to get feedback. I hope you guys enjoy.</p><p>*~~~~~*</p><h2><a href=\"https://unicornofdanger.tumblr.com/post/157450981908/masterlist\">Masterlist</a></h2><p>Peter Parker x Reader</p><p>Summary:\u00a0\n\nLeaving her past behind her, Y/n finally has the life she\u2019s been waiting for, working for the Avengers and being around people that love her. But that all comes crashing down when her past comes back to haunt her and she\u2019s forced to deal with it. But she doesn\u2019t believe that those closest to her will stay by her side, even her boyfriend, Peter, when her secrets come out.\n\n</p><p><a href=\"https://unicornofdanger.tumblr.com/post/185091320418/fever-dream\">Part 1</a>\u00a0/ Part 2 / <a href=\"https://unicornofdanger.tumblr.com/post/185227628633/fever-dream-part-3\">Part 3</a>\u00a0/ <a href=\"https://unicornofdanger.tumblr.com/post/185463661428/fever-dream-part-4\">Part 4</a></p><p>Word Count: 3.2k</p><p>Warnings: Language</p><hr><p>Y/n sighed, watching as her breath turned white in the cold air. She pumped her legs back and forth, hitting the building underneath as she watched the city below. As dangerous as sitting on the ledge was, there was no fear in her eyes. Not when she had spent so many nights doing it in high school. She had never been afraid of heights, not when the fall wouldn\u2019t do any damage. And being up so high, it made her feel free. Free from all her problems and her fears.</p><p>\tAfter what happened with her mother, after seeing her for the first time in years, Y/n could do nothing but run. She couldn\u2019t bear to see the look on Peter\u2019s face, the shock, the hurt. Even though her heart her, every emotion pulling at her, she couldn\u2019t help but worry about him. He was the first person to show her unconditional love and she feared that she ruined that. That she ruined the first good thing to happen to her in her whole life. But she knew no solution but to run.</p><p>But the fear of being disgusted by what she was, what she could do, fogged over everything. She couldn\u2019t handle the thought of losing those she cared about over something she couldn\u2019t change. It was what she feared above all. She had heard of other kids like her who had been kicked out of their homes, beaten, abused, and killed for what they were born with. It wasn\u2019t like they had any choice in what they were by blood. All they could do was live with who they were and make the best of it. But those around them couldn\u2019t do the same and Y/n feared that she would meet the same fate as some of those unlucky kids. </p><p>\u201cAre you gonna stay out here all night?\u201d</p><p>Y/n turned around to see Jessica walking towards her with a bottle of Jack, dark purple bruises covering her knuckles. As much as she wanted to ask, Jessica would always give her the same answer. And it wasn\u2019t like she didn\u2019t know what the woman got up to when she had time to spare. Turning back to look at the city around her, she shrugged. \u201cI like it up here. I missed this view. This is one thing the Avengers don\u2019t have\u201d</p><p>Jessica took a seat next to her, her back facing the street below. She was worried about the poor girl who spent most of her time, since arriving, on the roof. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to deal with your problems eventually, you know,\u201d she stated, opening the bottle in her hand and taking a drink.</p><p>Y/n grumbled. There were no other options, she knew that. If she kept ignoring her problems then she would always have them. They would probably end up ruining her life. But it wouldn\u2019t be easy, not when she had never tried to deal with them before. \u201cI don\u2019t know how,\u201d she sighed.</p><p>Did anyone know, though?</p><p>\u201cAre you talking about your parents or your abilities?\u201d</p><p>\u201cParents are easy. I\u2019ve avoided them for ages.\u201d She fiddled with her fingers, thinking back to the last thing her mother said to her. <i>You\u2019re just afraid of what you are, Y/n.</i> Truth be told, she was. She was completely afraid of who she was. She was terrified by the powers she possed. Powers that were bigger and stronger than her. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 I don\u2019t want to hurt anyone.\u201d</p><p>Jessica nodded, brushing a loose strand of black hair out of her face. It looked like she\u2019d gotten into it with someone, obviously, her strength had done little to help her. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know if you can hurt anyone. The only way to know is to practice.\u201d Setting the bottle on the ground, she turned to the girl next to her. \u201cAnd I think you should, otherwise, I\u2019ll have to hear you complain about it until I die.\u201d</p><p>She had a good point. If she didn\u2019t deal with it now while it was the root of her problems, she wouldn\u2019t want to go near the subject when it was the least of her worries. \u201cHow do I practice?\u201d</p><p>The woman smiled, looking over the edge of the building. Y/n didn\u2019t like that look one bit. \u201cNo. No, no, no, no. It won\u2019t end well,\u201d she shook her head, knowing exactly what Jessica was thinking. Out of all the powers she posed, of course, Jessica wanted her to use the most unpredictable one.</p><p>There was no way it was going to end well. It never did.</p><p>Jessica raised a brow. \u201cI don\u2019t see what the problem is. Unless your brain\u2019s a bitch, you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo-\u201d Before Y/n could continue protesting, Jessica pushed her over the edge, watching her fall to the ground until the girl vanished in mid-air. </p><p>\u201cWell, look at that. That bitch might just might know what she\u2019s doing.\u201d She picked up the bottle of Jack, taking a long drink. \u201cThere is hope for her yet.\u201d</p><p>She walked back into the building, deciding to wait for Y/n to return in a much warmer environment.</p><p>*~~~~~*</p><p>All Y/n could see was the dark, starless night sky above her, her body cutting through the air as she plummeted to the ground. Anyone in her position would be freaking out, overpowering their heart and mind as the end would be the only thing to come to mind. Waiting to feel the harsh concert against their skin. But as Y/n fell, catching the sight of Jessica above, her heart was beating at a normal pace and all she could think of was water. Something that would absorb her. Her body had taken over, knowing that the fall would do no damage. Relaxing. And before she knew it, she was plunged into darkness, cold liquid encasing her. But it wasn\u2019t concrete or blood that surrounded her.</p><p>Pushing her way to the surface, Y/n\u2019s head popped up out of the water, giving her a chance to catch her breath. All around her, on every side, where trees and the sky above was littered with stars. Something that she never saw in the city. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>This always happened. </p><p>It was an ability that she dared not use as it was often unpredictable. She had the power to almost teleport, but it often seemed that her powers had a mind of their own. They often did whatever they pleased. With teleporting, it often became a problem when she thought about going somewhere. In the middle of biology once, she had thought about going to a pizza place after school for dinner and it seemed that\u2019s just what her powers wanted as in the blink of an eye she was a pizza place. One in Maine. So, she learned not to trust that power. It did what it wanted. When she said one thing, it did another. What was worse was that not only could she jumped to places, but she could jump to different times as well, which was great, until she ended up in the middle of the Civil War. It was like Outlander, but ten times worse and real.</p><p>Swimming to the shore, she started to wonder where she was. Water was very vague. She could have ended up in the ocean, which wouldn\u2019t have been any better. But it would have been better than the middle of god knows where. It wasn\u2019t like she trusted her powers enough to use them to get back to New York. </p><p>The only power she would want to use if she had it was a flashlight. That would actually be pretty cool, no more wasting your phone battery or having to go find a flashlight if you were one. But she wasn\u2019t a human flashlight, just a human science experiment. </p><p>Once on shore, she laid on the soft dirt, looking up at the sky above. This is what she was afraid of. That she would be unable to control herself and end up in a bad situation. She was just glad that she had never accidentally teleported while around Peter or the rest of the Avengers. </p><p>She had a feeling that would freak more than just her out. </p><p>Thinking about Peter made her think about all his calls that she had avoided. It seemed that everyone and their mother had called her after she left, blowing up her phone. She didn\u2019t blame them, it showed they cared, but the last thing she wanted was to talk to any of them. She had no damn clue what to say. It wasn\u2019t like telling them that she was a vegan or something, it wasn\u2019t just something that they could brush off and continue about their day like nothing happened. It wasn\u2019t even something she could brush off. </p><p>Y/n dug in her back pocket, hoping that her phone was still there. It was the only way she would get out of the unknown around her. Her fingers brushed over a solid surface and she pulled it out, putting it close to her face. </p><p>\u201cThis better work. I would hate to be a bear\u2019s snack,\u201d she mumbled to herself, trying to turn the phone on. Tony had given everyone z new phone a few months back, he personally designed them. They were supposed to work in all sorts of conditions and always have service. As much as she wanted to believe that, with her luck, she wouldn\u2019t be surprised if her\u2019s didn\u2019t work. </p><p>After a few seconds of pressing the power button, the screen turned white before showing her lock screen, a picture of her and Peter during a trip to Quebec as her background. \u201cYes! Thank the gods!\u201d</p><p>Opening her phone, she sat up. It was sad that this was probably the highlight of her week. But it was a lifesaver. She opened the phone app and all she could do was stare at her contacts list. The list was small, only Jessica, Peter, Pepper, Happy, and the Avengers. Jessica was the only one she felt like calling, but she knew that, depending on where she was, it would be impossible for her to help. And being the asshole she was, Jessica would probably tell her to get out of there the same way she got there. </p><p>Looking back over the list, she sighed and turned her phone off, stuffing it back in her pocket. Maybe Jessica wanted this to happen. She probably knew that Y/n wouldn\u2019t want to call anyone but her, even if she couldn\u2019t do anything. Maybe this was the push she needed to finally overcome her problems and face her fears. Maybe this was the first of many small steps.</p><p>Getting to her feet, Y/n sucked in a breath. \u201cI can do this. I got here, I can get out of here,\u201d she told herself, though she didn\u2019t believe a word of it. Not when it came to the unknown. \u201cIt\u2019s not that hard. Just gotta be specific. I\u2019ll go to Jessica\u2019s. That\u2019s where I\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>Shaking out her fear and nerves, Y/n closed her eyes, giving her a second to calm down before she likely ended up in some other unknown place. As risky as it was, knowing that she could end up on the other side of the world or a hundred years in the past, she knew that if she didn\u2019t try, she would never have control. And that\u2019s what it was all about; control. </p><p>Her eyes opened and she willed her feet to carry her across the shore. The trees became a blur but the landscape didn\u2019t change, only the ground beneath her. Pavement scratched the bottom of her shoes as she came to an abrupt stop. </p><p>She was no longer in the middle of the woods, but she sure as hell wasn\u2019t in Jessica\u2019s apartment. </p><p>Her eyes followed the pavement, looking at where it lead to. In front of her was the Avengers facility. She shook her head, facepalming. Of course. Of course, this was where she would end up. </p><p>But it was better than in a place where she could be considered a meal by the wildlife. All she had to fear now was the bold squirrels that often tried to steal people\u2019s belongings. </p><p>Y/n trudged up the road, her wet shoes squeaking as she walked. Getting to the building, she stopped, looking up to the fourth floor where everyone likely was. Where the lounge was that she\u2019d ran from a few nights before. </p><p>Where her world had changed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just here to get dry and get a ride, that\u2019s it,\u201d she told herself. \u201cNo crying, no explanations, no emotions. Not right now. Not yet.\u201d</p><p>She pressed the buzzer and was greeted by the voice of Friday. \u201cY/n, please come in. I\u2019ll notify Tony that you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Y/n cringed at the greeting. \u201cPlease don\u2019t do that, Friday. I\u2019d rather no one know I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d The front door unlocked, allowing her in. </p><p>Once inside, all her fears came crashing back over her, making it feel like she was in the middle of an ocean. She pushed those fears aside, they would only get in the way of her mission; and that was to get dry. </p><p>Going the back way to get to her room, she crept down the hall, careful to make sure that no one was coming, but stopped in her tracks when she heard a few voices from the training from.</p><p>\u201cYou know where she\u2019s at?\u201d Y/n heard Carol ask. \u201cThen why not go get her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is she, Tony?\u201d Steve asked, his tone serious. </p><p>Y/n\u2019s eyes widen at the question. She had forgotten that Tony would be able to track her using her phone. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in New York City and that\u2019s where she\u2019s gonna stay until she\u2019s ready and willing to come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if she doesn\u2019t?\u201d Carol inquired. \u201cPeter is all beat up over this. Imagine the pain he may go through if she doesn\u2019t come back!\u201d</p><p>Tony sighed. \u201cI know, I know. You think I haven\u2019t thought of that! I love that kid like he\u2019s my own child, but he\u2019s gonna have to suck it up because I understand why Y/n left. It\u2019s hard to deal with family problems, I would know.\u201d</p><p>Hearing the floors creek, Y/n hurried away from the door, just in time as it opened, Carol and Steve walking out, their features blank. Rounding the corner, she was just about to turn her attention back to going to her room when her body collided with another. She stumbled back, using the wall to keep her from falling on the floor. </p><p>It was Natasha.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you go?\u201d she asked, grabbing her and pulling her into a hug. \u201cAnd why are you wet?\u201d</p><p>Y/n pulled away, not in the mood for questions. \u201cNowhere and it doesn\u2019t matter. And keep your voice down, I\u2019d like to get in and out without being noticed.\u201d</p><p>The woman crossed her arms over her chest. She clearly didn\u2019t like the answer she was given. \u201cDon\u2019t give me that crap, Y/n\u201d,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou left and everyone has been worried sick about you. You can\u2019t just pull things like that!\u201d</p><p>Y/n huffed, moving passed the assassin, heading to her room to get a change of clothes. \u201cI think I can. I\u2019m an adult and you people don\u2019t own me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we care about you!\u201d </p><p>Making it to her room, Y/n turned back to Natasha. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t give any of you the right to tell me what I can and can\u2019t do. I\u2019m my own person with my own problems just as you are and every other member of your team.\u201d</p><p>She slipped into her room, shutting the door in her friend\u2019s face. As much as it pained her to say such harsh things, she was tired of being treated like a child. She was 20 and was more than capable of taking care of herself. She had done it since she was 15, surviving off of much less than what she now had. It was nice to know that they cared about her, but it seemed that they had forgotten that she could make her own choices. </p><p>*~~~~~*</p><p>Y/n sat on the edge of her bed for a while, her wet clothes on the bathroom floor and a nice pair of dry ones took their place. Glancing at the clock on her nightstand, she sighed. </p><p>2:46</p><p>It was probably safe to leave as everyone was probably asleep. And she was grateful that Natasha hadn\u2019t gone and told everyone that she was back. The one thing she wanted above all was time and space. That was the only way she would be able to fix herself</p><p>Leaving her room, all the lights were off beside a few in the hallway to make sure no one tripped over anything. Any sign of life was gone as she walked through the halls. Looking back through the feed of the security cameras would be the only way they would know she had even been in the building.</p><p> Y/n stopped by her office on her way out, going to grab a bag from under her desk. It was full of everything she would need for a trip, stored there for the times Tony decided everyone was going on vacation without any notice. She grabbed the bag, turning to the door before catching sight of a picture of Tony, Pepper, Peter and her from one of their trips together. </p><p>What Carol had said earlier was echoing through her head. Knowing that she had hurt him, caused him pain, tore a hole in her heart. That was the last thing she wanted. </p><p>In a vain attempt to mend that hole as best she could, Y/n set the bag down, taking a seat in her chair and pulled out a pen and paper. In rushed words, she tried her best to explain that she would be gone for a while. That she would come back when the time was right, but that she loved him. She loved everyone and didn\u2019t mean to cause any pain. </p><p>Setting the pen down, she placed the note on her keyboard along with her phone. They didn\u2019t need to know where she was until she was ready. Standing from the chair, she grabbed the bag and headed out. </p><p>Many may have thought that what she was doing was running. Running away from her problems like she always did, but it wasn\u2019t like that. She intended to return. If she kept running, she would never be one with herself and never face her problems. And as much as everyone was probably willing to help her with that, it wasn\u2019t something that they needed to do. It was something she needed to do on her own. </p><p>Exiting the building, Y/n turned back, silently wishing everyone well until she returned. She didn\u2019t know how long she would be gone, but when she returned she would be the person she was always meant to be. </p><p>Turning away, she started into a sprint, gripping her bag like it was her lifeline, before disappearing into the night.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p><b>(Let me know if you want to be added to the taglist and I love to get feedback.

            "comment": "<p>A/N\u2019s: I\u2019m shocked that so many of you guys loved this story. Like I thought it would turn out like crap and I guess it didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t know if any of you guys even thought about it, but that woman that was mentioned in the first fic, Jessica, just so happens to be one of my favorite Marvel characters, Jessica Jones. I just thought I\u2019d let you know before we jump into the story. And I think I\u2019m gonna turn this into a series. Let me know if I should. As usual, don\u2019t be afraid to send in requests and I would love to get feedback. I hope you guys enjoy.</p><p>*~~~~~*</p><h2><a href=\"https://unicornofdanger.tumblr.com/post/157450981908/masterlist\">Masterlist</a></h2><p>Peter Parker x Reader</p><p>Summary:\u00a0\n\nLeaving her past behind her, Y/n finally has the life she\u2019s been waiting for, working for the Avengers and being around people that love her. But that all comes crashing down when her past comes back to haunt her and she\u2019s forced to deal with it. But she doesn\u2019t believe that those closest to her will stay by her side, even her boyfriend, Peter, when her secrets come out.\n\n</p><p><a href=\"https://unicornofdanger.tumblr.com/post/185091320418/fever-dream\">Part 1</a>\u00a0/ Part 2 / <a href=\"https://unicornofdanger.tumblr.com/post/185227628633/fever-dream-part-3\">Part 3</a>\u00a0/ <a href=\"https://unicornofdanger.tumblr.com/post/185463661428/fever-dream-part-4\">Part 4</a></p><p>Word Count: 3.2k</p><p>Warnings: Language</p><hr><p>Y/n sighed, watching as her breath turned white in the cold air. She pumped her legs back and forth, hitting the building underneath as she watched the city below. As dangerous as sitting on the ledge was, there was no fear in her eyes. Not when she had spent so many nights doing it in high school. She had never been afraid of heights, not when the fall wouldn\u2019t do any damage. And being up so high, it made her feel free. Free from all her problems and her fears.</p><p>\tAfter what happened with her mother, after seeing her for the first time in years, Y/n could do nothing but run. She couldn\u2019t bear to see the look on Peter\u2019s face, the shock, the hurt. Even though her heart her, every emotion pulling at her, she couldn\u2019t help but worry about him. He was the first person to show her unconditional love and she feared that she ruined that. That she ruined the first good thing to happen to her in her whole life. But she knew no solution but to run.</p><p>But the fear of being disgusted by what she was, what she could do, fogged over everything. She couldn\u2019t handle the thought of losing those she cared about over something she couldn\u2019t change. It was what she feared above all. She had heard of other kids like her who had been kicked out of their homes, beaten, abused, and killed for what they were born with. It wasn\u2019t like they had any choice in what they were by blood. All they could do was live with who they were and make the best of it. But those around them couldn\u2019t do the same and Y/n feared that she would meet the same fate as some of those unlucky kids. </p><p>\u201cAre you gonna stay out here all night?\u201d</p><p>Y/n turned around to see Jessica walking towards her with a bottle of Jack, dark purple bruises covering her knuckles. As much as she wanted to ask, Jessica would always give her the same answer. And it wasn\u2019t like she didn\u2019t know what the woman got up to when she had time to spare. Turning back to look at the city around her, she shrugged. \u201cI like it up here. I missed this view. This is one thing the Avengers don\u2019t have\u201d</p><p>Jessica took a seat next to her, her back facing the street below. She was worried about the poor girl who spent most of her time, since arriving, on the roof. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to deal with your problems eventually, you know,\u201d she stated, opening the bottle in her hand and taking a drink.</p><p>Y/n grumbled. There were no other options, she knew that. If she kept ignoring her problems then she would always have them. They would probably end up ruining her life. But it wouldn\u2019t be easy, not when she had never tried to deal with them before. \u201cI don\u2019t know how,\u201d she sighed.</p><p>Did anyone know, though?</p><p>\u201cAre you talking about your parents or your abilities?\u201d</p><p>\u201cParents are easy. I\u2019ve avoided them for ages.\u201d She fiddled with her fingers, thinking back to the last thing her mother said to her. <i>You\u2019re just afraid of what you are, Y/n.</i> Truth be told, she was. She was completely afraid of who she was. She was terrified by the powers she possed. Powers that were bigger and stronger than her. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 I don\u2019t want to hurt anyone.\u201d</p><p>Jessica nodded, brushing a loose strand of black hair out of her face. It looked like she\u2019d gotten into it with someone, obviously, her strength had done little to help her. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know if you can hurt anyone. The only way to know is to practice.\u201d Setting the bottle on the ground, she turned to the girl next to her. \u201cAnd I think you should, otherwise, I\u2019ll have to hear you complain about it until I die.\u201d</p><p>She had a good point. If she didn\u2019t deal with it now while it was the root of her problems, she wouldn\u2019t want to go near the subject when it was the least of her worries. \u201cHow do I practice?\u201d</p><p>The woman smiled, looking over the edge of the building. Y/n didn\u2019t like that look one bit. \u201cNo. No, no, no, no. It won\u2019t end well,\u201d she shook her head, knowing exactly what Jessica was thinking. Out of all the powers she posed, of course, Jessica wanted her to use the most unpredictable one.</p><p>There was no way it was going to end well. It never did.</p><p>Jessica raised a brow. \u201cI don\u2019t see what the problem is. Unless your brain\u2019s a bitch, you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo-\u201d Before Y/n could continue protesting, Jessica pushed her over the edge, watching her fall to the ground until the girl vanished in mid-air. </p><p>\u201cWell, look at that. That bitch might just might know what she\u2019s doing.\u201d She picked up the bottle of Jack, taking a long drink. \u201cThere is hope for her yet.\u201d</p><p>She walked back into the building, deciding to wait for Y/n to return in a much warmer environment.</p><p>*~~~~~*</p><p>All Y/n could see was the dark, starless night sky above her, her body cutting through the air as she plummeted to the ground. Anyone in her position would be freaking out, overpowering their heart and mind as the end would be the only thing to come to mind. Waiting to feel the harsh concert against their skin. But as Y/n fell, catching the sight of Jessica above, her heart was beating at a normal pace and all she could think of was water. Something that would absorb her. Her body had taken over, knowing that the fall would do no damage. Relaxing. And before she knew it, she was plunged into darkness, cold liquid encasing her. But it wasn\u2019t concrete or blood that surrounded her.</p><p>Pushing her way to the surface, Y/n\u2019s head popped up out of the water, giving her a chance to catch her breath. All around her, on every side, where trees and the sky above was littered with stars. Something that she never saw in the city. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>This always happened. </p><p>It was an ability that she dared not use as it was often unpredictable. She had the power to almost teleport, but it often seemed that her powers had a mind of their own. They often did whatever they pleased. With teleporting, it often became a problem when she thought about going somewhere. In the middle of biology once, she had thought about going to a pizza place after school for dinner and it seemed that\u2019s just what her powers wanted as in the blink of an eye she was a pizza place. One in Maine. So, she learned not to trust that power. It did what it wanted. When she said one thing, it did another. What was worse was that not only could she jumped to places, but she could jump to different times as well, which was great, until she ended up in the middle of the Civil War. It was like Outlander, but ten times worse and real.</p><p>Swimming to the shore, she started to wonder where she was. Water was very vague. She could have ended up in the ocean, which wouldn\u2019t have been any better. But it would have been better than the middle of god knows where. It wasn\u2019t like she trusted her powers enough to use them to get back to New York. </p><p>The only power she would want to use if she had it was a flashlight. That would actually be pretty cool, no more wasting your phone battery or having to go find a flashlight if you were one. But she wasn\u2019t a human flashlight, just a human science experiment. </p><p>Once on shore, she laid on the soft dirt, looking up at the sky above. This is what she was afraid of. That she would be unable to control herself and end up in a bad situation. She was just glad that she had never accidentally teleported while around Peter or the rest of the Avengers. </p><p>She had a feeling that would freak more than just her out. </p><p>Thinking about Peter made her think about all his calls that she had avoided. It seemed that everyone and their mother had called her after she left, blowing up her phone. She didn\u2019t blame them, it showed they cared, but the last thing she wanted was to talk to any of them. She had no damn clue what to say. It wasn\u2019t like telling them that she was a vegan or something, it wasn\u2019t just something that they could brush off and continue about their day like nothing happened. It wasn\u2019t even something she could brush off. </p><p>Y/n dug in her back pocket, hoping that her phone was still there. It was the only way she would get out of the unknown around her. Her fingers brushed over a solid surface and she pulled it out, putting it close to her face. </p><p>\u201cThis better work. I would hate to be a bear\u2019s snack,\u201d she mumbled to herself, trying to turn the phone on. Tony had given everyone z new phone a few months back, he personally designed them. They were supposed to work in all sorts of conditions and always have service. As much as she wanted to believe that, with her luck, she wouldn\u2019t be surprised if her\u2019s didn\u2019t work. </p><p>After a few seconds of pressing the power button, the screen turned white before showing her lock screen, a picture of her and Peter during a trip to Quebec as her background. \u201cYes! Thank the gods!\u201d</p><p>Opening her phone, she sat up. It was sad that this was probably the highlight of her week. But it was a lifesaver. She opened the phone app and all she could do was stare at her contacts list. The list was small, only Jessica, Peter, Pepper, Happy, and the Avengers. Jessica was the only one she felt like calling, but she knew that, depending on where she was, it would be impossible for her to help. And being the asshole she was, Jessica would probably tell her to get out of there the same way she got there. </p><p>Looking back over the list, she sighed and turned her phone off, stuffing it back in her pocket. Maybe Jessica wanted this to happen. She probably knew that Y/n wouldn\u2019t want to call anyone but her, even if she couldn\u2019t do anything. Maybe this was the push she needed to finally overcome her problems and face her fears. Maybe this was the first of many small steps.</p><p>Getting to her feet, Y/n sucked in a breath. \u201cI can do this. I got here, I can get out of here,\u201d she told herself, though she didn\u2019t believe a word of it. Not when it came to the unknown. \u201cIt\u2019s not that hard. Just gotta be specific. I\u2019ll go to Jessica\u2019s. That\u2019s where I\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>Shaking out her fear and nerves, Y/n closed her eyes, giving her a second to calm down before she likely ended up in some other unknown place. As risky as it was, knowing that she could end up on the other side of the world or a hundred years in the past, she knew that if she didn\u2019t try, she would never have control. And that\u2019s what it was all about; control. </p><p>Her eyes opened and she willed her feet to carry her across the shore. The trees became a blur but the landscape didn\u2019t change, only the ground beneath her. Pavement scratched the bottom of her shoes as she came to an abrupt stop. </p><p>She was no longer in the middle of the woods, but she sure as hell wasn\u2019t in Jessica\u2019s apartment. </p><p>Her eyes followed the pavement, looking at where it lead to. In front of her was the Avengers facility. She shook her head, facepalming. Of course. Of course, this was where she would end up. </p><p>But it was better than in a place where she could be considered a meal by the wildlife. All she had to fear now was the bold squirrels that often tried to steal people\u2019s belongings. </p><p>Y/n trudged up the road, her wet shoes squeaking as she walked. Getting to the building, she stopped, looking up to the fourth floor where everyone likely was. Where the lounge was that she\u2019d ran from a few nights before. </p><p>Where her world had changed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just here to get dry and get a ride, that\u2019s it,\u201d she told herself. \u201cNo crying, no explanations, no emotions. Not right now. Not yet.\u201d</p><p>She pressed the buzzer and was greeted by the voice of Friday. \u201cY/n, please come in. I\u2019ll notify Tony that you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Y/n cringed at the greeting. \u201cPlease don\u2019t do that, Friday. I\u2019d rather no one know I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d The front door unlocked, allowing her in. </p><p>Once inside, all her fears came crashing back over her, making it feel like she was in the middle of an ocean. She pushed those fears aside, they would only get in the way of her mission; and that was to get dry. </p><p>Going the back way to get to her room, she crept down the hall, careful to make sure that no one was coming, but stopped in her tracks when she heard a few voices from the training from.</p><p>\u201cYou know where she\u2019s at?\u201d Y/n heard Carol ask. \u201cThen why not go get her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is she, Tony?\u201d Steve asked, his tone serious. </p><p>Y/n\u2019s eyes widen at the question. She had forgotten that Tony would be able to track her using her phone. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in New York City and that\u2019s where she\u2019s gonna stay until she\u2019s ready and willing to come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if she doesn\u2019t?\u201d Carol inquired. \u201cPeter is all beat up over this. Imagine the pain he may go through if she doesn\u2019t come back!\u201d</p><p>Tony sighed. \u201cI know, I know. You think I haven\u2019t thought of that! I love that kid like he\u2019s my own child, but he\u2019s gonna have to suck it up because I understand why Y/n left. It\u2019s hard to deal with family problems, I would know.\u201d</p><p>Hearing the floors creek, Y/n hurried away from the door, just in time as it opened, Carol and Steve walking out, their features blank. Rounding the corner, she was just about to turn her attention back to going to her room when her body collided with another. She stumbled back, using the wall to keep her from falling on the floor. </p><p>It was Natasha.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you go?\u201d she asked, grabbing her and pulling her into a hug. \u201cAnd why are you wet?\u201d</p><p>Y/n pulled away, not in the mood for questions. \u201cNowhere and it doesn\u2019t matter. And keep your voice down, I\u2019d like to get in and out without being noticed.\u201d</p><p>The woman crossed her arms over her chest. She clearly didn\u2019t like the answer she was given. \u201cDon\u2019t give me that crap, Y/n\u201d,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou left and everyone has been worried sick about you. You can\u2019t just pull things like that!\u201d</p><p>Y/n huffed, moving passed the assassin, heading to her room to get a change of clothes. \u201cI think I can. I\u2019m an adult and you people don\u2019t own me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we care about you!\u201d </p><p>Making it to her room, Y/n turned back to Natasha. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t give any of you the right to tell me what I can and can\u2019t do. I\u2019m my own person with my own problems just as you are and every other member of your team.\u201d</p><p>She slipped into her room, shutting the door in her friend\u2019s face. As much as it pained her to say such harsh things, she was tired of being treated like a child. She was 20 and was more than capable of taking care of herself. She had done it since she was 15, surviving off of much less than what she now had. It was nice to know that they cared about her, but it seemed that they had forgotten that she could make her own choices. </p><p>*~~~~~*</p><p>Y/n sat on the edge of her bed for a while, her wet clothes on the bathroom floor and a nice pair of dry ones took their place. Glancing at the clock on her nightstand, she sighed. </p><p>2:46</p><p>It was probably safe to leave as everyone was probably asleep. And she was grateful that Natasha hadn\u2019t gone and told everyone that she was back. The one thing she wanted above all was time and space. That was the only way she would be able to fix herself</p><p>Leaving her room, all the lights were off beside a few in the hallway to make sure no one tripped over anything. Any sign of life was gone as she walked through the halls. Looking back through the feed of the security cameras would be the only way they would know she had even been in the building.</p><p> Y/n stopped by her office on her way out, going to grab a bag from under her desk. It was full of everything she would need for a trip, stored there for the times Tony decided everyone was going on vacation without any notice. She grabbed the bag, turning to the door before catching sight of a picture of Tony, Pepper, Peter and her from one of their trips together. </p><p>What Carol had said earlier was echoing through her head. Knowing that she had hurt him, caused him pain, tore a hole in her heart. That was the last thing she wanted. </p><p>In a vain attempt to mend that hole as best she could, Y/n set the bag down, taking a seat in her chair and pulled out a pen and paper. In rushed words, she tried her best to explain that she would be gone for a while. That she would come back when the time was right, but that she loved him. She loved everyone and didn\u2019t mean to cause any pain. </p><p>Setting the pen down, she placed the note on her keyboard along with her phone. They didn\u2019t need to know where she was until she was ready. Standing from the chair, she grabbed the bag and headed out. </p><p>Many may have thought that what she was doing was running. Running away from her problems like she always did, but it wasn\u2019t like that. She intended to return. If she kept running, she would never be one with herself and never face her problems. And as much as everyone was probably willing to help her with that, it wasn\u2019t something that they needed to do. It was something she needed to do on her own. </p><p>Exiting the building, Y/n turned back, silently wishing everyone well until she returned. She didn\u2019t know how long she would be gone, but when she returned she would be the person she was always meant to be. </p><p>Turning away, she started into a sprint, gripping her bag like it was her lifeline, before disappearing into the night.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p><b>(Let me know if you want to be added to the taglist and I love to get feedback.

But she doesn\u2019t believe that those closest to her will stay by her side, even her boyfriend, Peter, when her secrets come out.\n\n</p><p><a href=\"https://unicornofdanger.tumblr.com/post/185091320418/fever-dream\">Part 1</a>\u00a0/ Part 2 / <a href=\"https://unicornofdanger.tumblr.com/post/185227628633/fever-dream-part-3\">Part 3</a>\u00a0/ <a href=\"https://unicornofdanger.tumblr.com/post/185463661428/fever-dream-part-4\">Part 4</a></p><p>Word Count: 3.2k</p><p>Warnings: Language</p><hr><p>Y/n sighed, watching as her breath turned white in the cold air. She pumped her legs back and forth, hitting the building underneath as she watched the city below. As dangerous as sitting on the ledge was, there was no fear in her eyes. Not when she had spent so many nights doing it in high school. She had never been afraid of heights, not when the fall wouldn\u2019t do any damage. And being up so high, it made her feel free. Free from all her problems and her fears.</p><p>\tAfter what happened with her mother, after seeing her for the first time in years, Y/n could do nothing but run. She couldn\u2019t bear to see the look on Peter\u2019s face, the shock, the hurt. Even though her heart her, every emotion pulling at her, she couldn\u2019t help but worry about him. He was the first person to show her unconditional love and she feared that she ruined that. That she ruined the first good thing to happen to her in her whole life. But she knew no solution but to run.</p><p>But the fear of being disgusted by what she was, what she could do, fogged over everything. She couldn\u2019t handle the thought of losing those she cared about over something she couldn\u2019t change. It was what she feared above all. She had heard of other kids like her who had been kicked out of their homes, beaten, abused, and killed for what they were born with. It wasn\u2019t like they had any choice in what they were by blood. All they could do was live with who they were and make the best of it. But those around them couldn\u2019t do the same and Y/n feared that she would meet the same fate as some of those unlucky kids. </p><p>\u201cAre you gonna stay out here all night?\u201d</p><p>Y/n turned around to see Jessica walking towards her with a bottle of Jack, dark purple bruises covering her knuckles. As much as she wanted to ask, Jessica would always give her the same answer. And it wasn\u2019t like she didn\u2019t know what the woman got up to when she had time to spare. Turning back to look at the city around her, she shrugged. \u201cI like it up here. I missed this view. This is one thing the Avengers don\u2019t have\u201d</p><p>Jessica took a seat next to her, her back facing the street below. She was worried about the poor girl who spent most of her time, since arriving, on the roof. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to deal with your problems eventually, you know,\u201d she stated, opening the bottle in her hand and taking a drink.</p><p>Y/n grumbled. There were no other options, she knew that. If she kept ignoring her problems then she would always have them. They would probably end up ruining her life. But it wouldn\u2019t be easy, not when she had never tried to deal with them before. \u201cI don\u2019t know how,\u201d she sighed.</p><p>Did anyone know, though?</p><p>\u201cAre you talking about your parents or your abilities?\u201d</p><p>\u201cParents are easy. I\u2019ve avoided them for ages.\u201d She fiddled with her fingers, thinking back to the last thing her mother said to her. <i>You\u2019re just afraid of what you are, Y/n.</i> Truth be told, she was. She was completely afraid of who she was. She was terrified by the powers she possed. Powers that were bigger and stronger than her. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 I don\u2019t want to hurt anyone.\u201d</p><p>Jessica nodded, brushing a loose strand of black hair out of her face. It looked like she\u2019d gotten into it with someone, obviously, her strength had done little to help her. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know if you can hurt anyone. The only way to know is to practice.\u201d Setting the bottle on the ground, she turned to the girl next to her. \u201cAnd I think you should, otherwise, I\u2019ll have to hear you complain about it until I die.\u201d</p><p>She had a good point. If she didn\u2019t deal with it now while it was the root of her problems, she wouldn\u2019t want to go near the subject when it was the least of her worries. \u201cHow do I practice?\u201d</p><p>The woman smiled, looking over the edge of the building. Y/n didn\u2019t like that look one bit. \u201cNo. No, no, no, no. It won\u2019t end well,\u201d she shook her head, knowing exactly what Jessica was thinking. Out of all the powers she posed, of course, Jessica wanted her to use the most unpredictable one.</p><p>There was no way it was going to end well. It never did.</p><p>Jessica raised a brow. \u201cI don\u2019t see what the problem is. Unless your brain\u2019s a bitch, you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo-\u201d Before Y/n could continue protesting, Jessica pushed her over the edge, watching her fall to the ground until the girl vanished in mid-air. </p><p>\u201cWell, look at that. That bitch might just might know what she\u2019s doing.\u201d She picked up the bottle of Jack, taking a long drink. \u201cThere is hope for her yet.\u201d</p><p>She walked back into the building, deciding to wait for Y/n to return in a much warmer environment.</p><p>*~~~~~*</p><p>All Y/n could see was the dark, starless night sky above her, her body cutting through the air as she plummeted to the ground. Anyone in her position would be freaking out, overpowering their heart and mind as the end would be the only thing to come to mind. Waiting to feel the harsh concert against their skin. But as Y/n fell, catching the sight of Jessica above, her heart was beating at a normal pace and all she could think of was water. Something that would absorb her. Her body had taken over, knowing that the fall would do no damage. Relaxing. And before she knew it, she was plunged into darkness, cold liquid encasing her. But it wasn\u2019t concrete or blood that surrounded her.</p><p>Pushing her way to the surface, Y/n\u2019s head popped up out of the water, giving her a chance to catch her breath. All around her, on every side, where trees and the sky above was littered with stars. Something that she never saw in the city. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>This always happened. </p><p>It was an ability that she dared not use as it was often unpredictable. She had the power to almost teleport, but it often seemed that her powers had a mind of their own. They often did whatever they pleased. With teleporting, it often became a problem when she thought about going somewhere. In the middle of biology once, she had thought about going to a pizza place after school for dinner and it seemed that\u2019s just what her powers wanted as in the blink of an eye she was a pizza place. One in Maine. So, she learned not to trust that power. It did what it wanted. When she said one thing, it did another. What was worse was that not only could she jumped to places, but she could jump to different times as well, which was great, until she ended up in the middle of the Civil War. It was like Outlander, but ten times worse and real.</p><p>Swimming to the shore, she started to wonder where she was. Water was very vague. She could have ended up in the ocean, which wouldn\u2019t have been any better. But it would have been better than the middle of god knows where. It wasn\u2019t like she trusted her powers enough to use them to get back to New York. </p><p>The only power she would want to use if she had it was a flashlight. That would actually be pretty cool, no more wasting your phone battery or having to go find a flashlight if you were one. But she wasn\u2019t a human flashlight, just a human science experiment. </p><p>Once on shore, she laid on the soft dirt, looking up at the sky above. This is what she was afraid of. That she would be unable to control herself and end up in a bad situation. She was just glad that she had never accidentally teleported while around Peter or the rest of the Avengers. </p><p>She had a feeling that would freak more than just her out. </p><p>Thinking about Peter made her think about all his calls that she had avoided. It seemed that everyone and their mother had called her after she left, blowing up her phone. She didn\u2019t blame them, it showed they cared, but the last thing she wanted was to talk to any of them. She had no damn clue what to say. It wasn\u2019t like telling them that she was a vegan or something, it wasn\u2019t just something that they could brush off and continue about their day like nothing happened. It wasn\u2019t even something she could brush off. </p><p>Y/n dug in her back pocket, hoping that her phone was still there. It was the only way she would get out of the unknown around her. Her fingers brushed over a solid surface and she pulled it out, putting it close to her face. </p><p>\u201cThis better work. I would hate to be a bear\u2019s snack,\u201d she mumbled to herself, trying to turn the phone on. Tony had given everyone z new phone a few months back, he personally designed them. They were supposed to work in all sorts of conditions and always have service. As much as she wanted to believe that, with her luck, she wouldn\u2019t be surprised if her\u2019s didn\u2019t work. </p><p>After a few seconds of pressing the power button, the screen turned white before showing her lock screen, a picture of her and Peter during a trip to Quebec as her background. \u201cYes! Thank the gods!\u201d</p><p>Opening her phone, she sat up. It was sad that this was probably the highlight of her week. But it was a lifesaver. She opened the phone app and all she could do was stare at her contacts list. The list was small, only Jessica, Peter, Pepper, Happy, and the Avengers. Jessica was the only one she felt like calling, but she knew that, depending on where she was, it would be impossible for her to help. And being the asshole she was, Jessica would probably tell her to get out of there the same way she got there. </p><p>Looking back over the list, she sighed and turned her phone off, stuffing it back in her pocket. Maybe Jessica wanted this to happen. She probably knew that Y/n wouldn\u2019t want to call anyone but her, even if she couldn\u2019t do anything. Maybe this was the push she needed to finally overcome her problems and face her fears. Maybe this was the first of many small steps.</p><p>Getting to her feet, Y/n sucked in a breath. \u201cI can do this. I got here, I can get out of here,\u201d she told herself, though she didn\u2019t believe a word of it. Not when it came to the unknown. \u201cIt\u2019s not that hard. Just gotta be specific. I\u2019ll go to Jessica\u2019s. That\u2019s where I\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>Shaking out her fear and nerves, Y/n closed her eyes, giving her a second to calm down before she likely ended up in some other unknown place. As risky as it was, knowing that she could end up on the other side of the world or a hundred years in the past, she knew that if she didn\u2019t try, she would never have control. And that\u2019s what it was all about; control. </p><p>Her eyes opened and she willed her feet to carry her across the shore. The trees became a blur but the landscape didn\u2019t change, only the ground beneath her. Pavement scratched the bottom of her shoes as she came to an abrupt stop. </p><p>She was no longer in the middle of the woods, but she sure as hell wasn\u2019t in Jessica\u2019s apartment. </p><p>Her eyes followed the pavement, looking at where it lead to. In front of her was the Avengers facility. She shook her head, facepalming. Of course. Of course, this was where she would end up. </p><p>But it was better than in a place where she could be considered a meal by the wildlife. All she had to fear now was the bold squirrels that often tried to steal people\u2019s belongings. </p><p>Y/n trudged up the road, her wet shoes squeaking as she walked. Getting to the building, she stopped, looking up to the fourth floor where everyone likely was. Where the lounge was that she\u2019d ran from a few nights before. </p><p>Where her world had changed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just here to get dry and get a ride, that\u2019s it,\u201d she told herself. \u201cNo crying, no explanations, no emotions. Not right now. Not yet.\u201d</p><p>She pressed the buzzer and was greeted by the voice of Friday. \u201cY/n, please come in. I\u2019ll notify Tony that you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Y/n cringed at the greeting. \u201cPlease don\u2019t do that, Friday. I\u2019d rather no one know I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d The front door unlocked, allowing her in. </p><p>Once inside, all her fears came crashing back over her, making it feel like she was in the middle of an ocean. She pushed those fears aside, they would only get in the way of her mission; and that was to get dry. </p><p>Going the back way to get to her room, she crept down the hall, careful to make sure that no one was coming, but stopped in her tracks when she heard a few voices from the training from.</p><p>\u201cYou know where she\u2019s at?\u201d Y/n heard Carol ask. \u201cThen why not go get her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is she, Tony?\u201d Steve asked, his tone serious. </p><p>Y/n\u2019s eyes widen at the question. She had forgotten that Tony would be able to track her using her phone. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in New York City and that\u2019s where she\u2019s gonna stay until she\u2019s ready and willing to come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if she doesn\u2019t?\u201d Carol inquired. \u201cPeter is all beat up over this. Imagine the pain he may go through if she doesn\u2019t come back!\u201d</p><p>Tony sighed. \u201cI know, I know. You think I haven\u2019t thought of that! I love that kid like he\u2019s my own child, but he\u2019s gonna have to suck it up because I understand why Y/n left. It\u2019s hard to deal with family problems, I would know.\u201d</p><p>Hearing the floors creek, Y/n hurried away from the door, just in time as it opened, Carol and Steve walking out, their features blank. Rounding the corner, she was just about to turn her attention back to going to her room when her body collided with another. She stumbled back, using the wall to keep her from falling on the floor. </p><p>It was Natasha.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you go?\u201d she asked, grabbing her and pulling her into a hug. \u201cAnd why are you wet?\u201d</p><p>Y/n pulled away, not in the mood for questions. \u201cNowhere and it doesn\u2019t matter. And keep your voice down, I\u2019d like to get in and out without being noticed.\u201d</p><p>The woman crossed her arms over her chest. She clearly didn\u2019t like the answer she was given. \u201cDon\u2019t give me that crap, Y/n\u201d,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou left and everyone has been worried sick about you. You can\u2019t just pull things like that!\u201d</p><p>Y/n huffed, moving passed the assassin, heading to her room to get a change of clothes. \u201cI think I can. I\u2019m an adult and you people don\u2019t own me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we care about you!\u201d </p><p>Making it to her room, Y/n turned back to Natasha. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t give any of you the right to tell me what I can and can\u2019t do. I\u2019m my own person with my own problems just as you are and every other member of your team.\u201d</p><p>She slipped into her room, shutting the door in her friend\u2019s face. As much as it pained her to say such harsh things, she was tired of being treated like a child. She was 20 and was more than capable of taking care of herself. She had done it since she was 15, surviving off of much less than what she now had. It was nice to know that they cared about her, but it seemed that they had forgotten that she could make her own choices. </p><p>*~~~~~*</p><p>Y/n sat on the edge of her bed for a while, her wet clothes on the bathroom floor and a nice pair of dry ones took their place. Glancing at the clock on her nightstand, she sighed. </p><p>2:46</p><p>It was probably safe to leave as everyone was probably asleep. And she was grateful that Natasha hadn\u2019t gone and told everyone that she was back. The one thing she wanted above all was time and space. That was the only way she would be able to fix herself</p><p>Leaving her room, all the lights were off beside a few in the hallway to make sure no one tripped over anything. Any sign of life was gone as she walked through the halls. Looking back through the feed of the security cameras would be the only way they would know she had even been in the building.</p><p> Y/n stopped by her office on her way out, going to grab a bag from under her desk. It was full of everything she would need for a trip, stored there for the times Tony decided everyone was going on vacation without any notice. She grabbed the bag, turning to the door before catching sight of a picture of Tony, Pepper, Peter and her from one of their trips together. </p><p>What Carol had said earlier was echoing through her head. Knowing that she had hurt him, caused him pain, tore a hole in her heart. That was the last thing she wanted. </p><p>In a vain attempt to mend that hole as best she could, Y/n set the bag down, taking a seat in her chair and pulled out a pen and paper. In rushed words, she tried her best to explain that she would be gone for a while. That she would come back when the time was right, but that she loved him. She loved everyone and didn\u2019t mean to cause any pain. </p><p>Setting the pen down, she placed the note on her keyboard along with her phone. They didn\u2019t need to know where she was until she was ready. Standing from the chair, she grabbed the bag and headed out. </p><p>Many may have thought that what she was doing was running. Running away from her problems like she always did, but it wasn\u2019t like that. She intended to return. If she kept running, she would never be one with herself and never face her problems. And as much as everyone was probably willing to help her with that, it wasn\u2019t something that they needed to do. It was something she needed to do on her own. </p><p>Exiting the building, Y/n turned back, silently wishing everyone well until she returned. She didn\u2019t know how long she would be gone, but when she returned she would be the person she was always meant to be. </p><p>Turning away, she started into a sprint, gripping her bag like it was her lifeline, before disappearing into the night.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p><b>(Let me know if you want to be added to the taglist and I love to get feedback.

But she doesn&rsquo;t believe that those closest to her will stay by her side, even her boyfriend, Peter, when her secrets come out.\n\n</p><p><a href=\"https://unicornofdanger.tumblr.com/post/185091320418/fever-dream\">Part 1</a>&nbsp;/ Part 2 / <a href=\"https://unicornofdanger.tumblr.com/post/185227628633/fever-dream-part-3\">Part 3</a>&nbsp;/ <a href=\"https://unicornofdanger.tumblr.com/post/185463661428/fever-dream-part-4\">Part 4</a></p><p>Word Count: 3.2k</p><p>Warnings: Language</p><hr /><p>Y/n sighed, watching as her breath turned white in the cold air. She pumped her legs back and forth, hitting the building underneath as she watched the city below. As dangerous as sitting on the ledge was, there was no fear in her eyes. Not when she had spent so many nights doing it in high school. She had never been afraid of heights, not when the fall wouldn&rsquo;t do any damage. And being up so high, it made her feel free. Free from all her problems and her fears.</p><p>\tAfter what happened with her mother, after seeing her for the first time in years, Y/n could do nothing but run. She couldn&rsquo;t bear to see the look on Peter&rsquo;s face, the shock, the hurt. Even though her heart her, every emotion pulling at her, she couldn&rsquo;t help but worry about him. He was the first person to show her unconditional love and she feared that she ruined that. That she ruined the first good thing to happen to her in her whole life. But she knew no solution but to run.</p><p>But the fear of being disgusted by what she was, what she could do, fogged over everything. She couldn&rsquo;t handle the thought of losing those she cared about over something she couldn&rsquo;t change. It was what she feared above all. She had heard of other kids like her who had been kicked out of their homes, beaten, abused, and killed for what they were born with. It wasn&rsquo;t like they had any choice in what they were by blood. All they could do was live with who they were and make the best of it. But those around them couldn&rsquo;t do the same and Y/n feared that she would meet the same fate as some of those unlucky kids. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you gonna stay out here all night?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/n turned around to see Jessica walking towards her with a bottle of Jack, dark purple bruises covering her knuckles. As much as she wanted to ask, Jessica would always give her the same answer. And it wasn&rsquo;t like she didn&rsquo;t know what the woman got up to when she had time to spare. Turning back to look at the city around her, she shrugged. &ldquo;I like it up here. I missed this view. This is one thing the Avengers don&rsquo;t have&rdquo;</p><p>Jessica took a seat next to her, her back facing the street below. She was worried about the poor girl who spent most of her time, since arriving, on the roof. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re gonna have to deal with your problems eventually, you know,&rdquo; she stated, opening the bottle in her hand and taking a drink.</p><p>Y/n grumbled. There were no other options, she knew that. If she kept ignoring her problems then she would always have them. They would probably end up ruining her life. But it wouldn&rsquo;t be easy, not when she had never tried to deal with them before. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how,&rdquo; she sighed.</p><p>Did anyone know, though?</p><p>&ldquo;Are you talking about your parents or your abilities?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Parents are easy. I&rsquo;ve avoided them for ages.&rdquo; She fiddled with her fingers, thinking back to the last thing her mother said to her. <i>You&rsquo;re just afraid of what you are, Y/n.</i> Truth be told, she was. She was completely afraid of who she was. She was terrified by the powers she possed. Powers that were bigger and stronger than her. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just&hellip; I don&rsquo;t want to hurt anyone.&rdquo;</p><p>Jessica nodded, brushing a loose strand of black hair out of her face. It looked like she&rsquo;d gotten into it with someone, obviously, her strength had done little to help her. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t even know if you can hurt anyone. The only way to know is to practice.&rdquo; Setting the bottle on the ground, she turned to the girl next to her. &ldquo;And I think you should, otherwise, I&rsquo;ll have to hear you complain about it until I die.&rdquo;</p><p>She had a good point. If she didn&rsquo;t deal with it now while it was the root of her problems, she wouldn&rsquo;t want to go near the subject when it was the least of her worries. &ldquo;How do I practice?&rdquo;</p><p>The woman smiled, looking over the edge of the building. Y/n didn&rsquo;t like that look one bit. &ldquo;No. No, no, no, no. It won&rsquo;t end well,&rdquo; she shook her head, knowing exactly what Jessica was thinking. Out of all the powers she posed, of course, Jessica wanted her to use the most unpredictable one.</p><p>There was no way it was going to end well. It never did.</p><p>Jessica raised a brow. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what the problem is. Unless your brain&rsquo;s a bitch, you&rsquo;ll be fine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No-&rdquo; Before Y/n could continue protesting, Jessica pushed her over the edge, watching her fall to the ground until the girl vanished in mid-air. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, look at that. That bitch might just might know what she&rsquo;s doing.&rdquo; She picked up the bottle of Jack, taking a long drink. &ldquo;There is hope for her yet.&rdquo;</p><p>She walked back into the building, deciding to wait for Y/n to return in a much warmer environment.</p><p>*~~~~~*</p><p>All Y/n could see was the dark, starless night sky above her, her body cutting through the air as she plummeted to the ground. Anyone in her position would be freaking out, overpowering their heart and mind as the end would be the only thing to come to mind. Waiting to feel the harsh concert against their skin. But as Y/n fell, catching the sight of Jessica above, her heart was beating at a normal pace and all she could think of was water. Something that would absorb her. Her body had taken over, knowing that the fall would do no damage. Relaxing. And before she knew it, she was plunged into darkness, cold liquid encasing her. But it wasn&rsquo;t concrete or blood that surrounded her.</p><p>Pushing her way to the surface, Y/n&rsquo;s head popped up out of the water, giving her a chance to catch her breath. All around her, on every side, where trees and the sky above was littered with stars. Something that she never saw in the city. &ldquo;Shit.&rdquo;</p><p>This always happened. </p><p>It was an ability that she dared not use as it was often unpredictable. She had the power to almost teleport, but it often seemed that her powers had a mind of their own. They often did whatever they pleased. With teleporting, it often became a problem when she thought about going somewhere. In the middle of biology once, she had thought about going to a pizza place after school for dinner and it seemed that&rsquo;s just what her powers wanted as in the blink of an eye she was a pizza place. One in Maine. So, she learned not to trust that power. It did what it wanted. When she said one thing, it did another. What was worse was that not only could she jumped to places, but she could jump to different times as well, which was great, until she ended up in the middle of the Civil War. It was like Outlander, but ten times worse and real.</p><p>Swimming to the shore, she started to wonder where she was. Water was very vague. She could have ended up in the ocean, which wouldn&rsquo;t have been any better. But it would have been better than the middle of god knows where. It wasn&rsquo;t like she trusted her powers enough to use them to get back to New York. </p><p>The only power she would want to use if she had it was a flashlight. That would actually be pretty cool, no more wasting your phone battery or having to go find a flashlight if you were one. But she wasn&rsquo;t a human flashlight, just a human science experiment. </p><p>Once on shore, she laid on the soft dirt, looking up at the sky above. This is what she was afraid of. That she would be unable to control herself and end up in a bad situation. She was just glad that she had never accidentally teleported while around Peter or the rest of the Avengers. </p><p>She had a feeling that would freak more than just her out. </p><p>Thinking about Peter made her think about all his calls that she had avoided. It seemed that everyone and their mother had called her after she left, blowing up her phone. She didn&rsquo;t blame them, it showed they cared, but the last thing she wanted was to talk to any of them. She had no damn clue what to say. It wasn&rsquo;t like telling them that she was a vegan or something, it wasn&rsquo;t just something that they could brush off and continue about their day like nothing happened. It wasn&rsquo;t even something she could brush off. </p><p>Y/n dug in her back pocket, hoping that her phone was still there. It was the only way she would get out of the unknown around her. Her fingers brushed over a solid surface and she pulled it out, putting it close to her face. </p><p>&ldquo;This better work. I would hate to be a bear&rsquo;s snack,&rdquo; she mumbled to herself, trying to turn the phone on. Tony had given everyone z new phone a few months back, he personally designed them. They were supposed to work in all sorts of conditions and always have service. As much as she wanted to believe that, with her luck, she wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if her&rsquo;s didn&rsquo;t work. </p><p>After a few seconds of pressing the power button, the screen turned white before showing her lock screen, a picture of her and Peter during a trip to Quebec as her background. &ldquo;Yes! Thank the gods!&rdquo;</p><p>Opening her phone, she sat up. It was sad that this was probably the highlight of her week. But it was a lifesaver. She opened the phone app and all she could do was stare at her contacts list. The list was small, only Jessica, Peter, Pepper, Happy, and the Avengers. Jessica was the only one she felt like calling, but she knew that, depending on where she was, it would be impossible for her to help. And being the asshole she was, Jessica would probably tell her to get out of there the same way she got there. </p><p>Looking back over the list, she sighed and turned her phone off, stuffing it back in her pocket. Maybe Jessica wanted this to happen. She probably knew that Y/n wouldn&rsquo;t want to call anyone but her, even if she couldn&rsquo;t do anything. Maybe this was the push she needed to finally overcome her problems and face her fears. Maybe this was the first of many small steps.</p><p>Getting to her feet, Y/n sucked in a breath. &ldquo;I can do this. I got here, I can get out of here,&rdquo; she told herself, though she didn&rsquo;t believe a word of it. Not when it came to the unknown. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that hard. Just gotta be specific. I&rsquo;ll go to Jessica&rsquo;s. That&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;</p><p>Shaking out her fear and nerves, Y/n closed her eyes, giving her a second to calm down before she likely ended up in some other unknown place. As risky as it was, knowing that she could end up on the other side of the world or a hundred years in the past, she knew that if she didn&rsquo;t try, she would never have control. And that&rsquo;s what it was all about; control. </p><p>Her eyes opened and she willed her feet to carry her across the shore. The trees became a blur but the landscape didn&rsquo;t change, only the ground beneath her. Pavement scratched the bottom of her shoes as she came to an abrupt stop. </p><p>She was no longer in the middle of the woods, but she sure as hell wasn&rsquo;t in Jessica&rsquo;s apartment. </p><p>Her eyes followed the pavement, looking at where it lead to. In front of her was the Avengers facility. She shook her head, facepalming. Of course. Of course, this was where she would end up. </p><p>But it was better than in a place where she could be considered a meal by the wildlife. All she had to fear now was the bold squirrels that often tried to steal people&rsquo;s belongings. </p><p>Y/n trudged up the road, her wet shoes squeaking as she walked. Getting to the building, she stopped, looking up to the fourth floor where everyone likely was. Where the lounge was that she&rsquo;d ran from a few nights before. </p><p>Where her world had changed.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just here to get dry and get a ride, that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;No crying, no explanations, no emotions. Not right now. Not yet.&rdquo;</p><p>She pressed the buzzer and was greeted by the voice of Friday. &ldquo;Y/n, please come in. I&rsquo;ll notify Tony that you&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/n cringed at the greeting. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t do that, Friday. I&rsquo;d rather no one know I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alright.&rdquo; The front door unlocked, allowing her in. </p><p>Once inside, all her fears came crashing back over her, making it feel like she was in the middle of an ocean. She pushed those fears aside, they would only get in the way of her mission; and that was to get dry. </p><p>Going the back way to get to her room, she crept down the hall, careful to make sure that no one was coming, but stopped in her tracks when she heard a few voices from the training from.</p><p>&ldquo;You know where she&rsquo;s at?&rdquo; Y/n heard Carol ask. &ldquo;Then why not go get her?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where is she, Tony?&rdquo; Steve asked, his tone serious. </p><p>Y/n&rsquo;s eyes widen at the question. She had forgotten that Tony would be able to track her using her phone. </p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s in New York City and that&rsquo;s where she&rsquo;s gonna stay until she&rsquo;s ready and willing to come back.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But what if she doesn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; Carol inquired. &ldquo;Peter is all beat up over this. Imagine the pain he may go through if she doesn&rsquo;t come back!&rdquo;</p><p>Tony sighed. &ldquo;I know, I know. You think I haven&rsquo;t thought of that! I love that kid like he&rsquo;s my own child, but he&rsquo;s gonna have to suck it up because I understand why Y/n left. It&rsquo;s hard to deal with family problems, I would know.&rdquo;</p><p>Hearing the floors creek, Y/n hurried away from the door, just in time as it opened, Carol and Steve walking out, their features blank. Rounding the corner, she was just about to turn her attention back to going to her room when her body collided with another. She stumbled back, using the wall to keep her from falling on the floor. </p><p>It was Natasha.</p><p>&ldquo;Where did you go?&rdquo; she asked, grabbing her and pulling her into a hug. &ldquo;And why are you wet?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/n pulled away, not in the mood for questions. &ldquo;Nowhere and it doesn&rsquo;t matter. And keep your voice down, I&rsquo;d like to get in and out without being noticed.&rdquo;</p><p>The woman crossed her arms over her chest. She clearly didn&rsquo;t like the answer she was given. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give me that crap, Y/n&rdquo;,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;You left and everyone has been worried sick about you. You can&rsquo;t just pull things like that!&rdquo;</p><p>Y/n huffed, moving passed the assassin, heading to her room to get a change of clothes. &ldquo;I think I can. I&rsquo;m an adult and you people don&rsquo;t own me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But we care about you!&rdquo; </p><p>Making it to her room, Y/n turned back to Natasha. &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t give any of you the right to tell me what I can and can&rsquo;t do. I&rsquo;m my own person with my own problems just as you are and every other member of your team.&rdquo;</p><p>She slipped into her room, shutting the door in her friend&rsquo;s face. As much as it pained her to say such harsh things, she was tired of being treated like a child. She was 20 and was more than capable of taking care of herself. She had done it since she was 15, surviving off of much less than what she now had. It was nice to know that they cared about her, but it seemed that they had forgotten that she could make her own choices. </p><p>*~~~~~*</p><p>Y/n sat on the edge of her bed for a while, her wet clothes on the bathroom floor and a nice pair of dry ones took their place. Glancing at the clock on her nightstand, she sighed. </p><p>2:46</p><p>It was probably safe to leave as everyone was probably asleep. And she was grateful that Natasha hadn&rsquo;t gone and told everyone that she was back. The one thing she wanted above all was time and space. That was the only way she would be able to fix herself</p><p>Leaving her room, all the lights were off beside a few in the hallway to make sure no one tripped over anything. Any sign of life was gone as she walked through the halls. Looking back through the feed of the security cameras would be the only way they would know she had even been in the building.</p><p> Y/n stopped by her office on her way out, going to grab a bag from under her desk. It was full of everything she would need for a trip, stored there for the times Tony decided everyone was going on vacation without any notice. She grabbed the bag, turning to the door before catching sight of a picture of Tony, Pepper, Peter and her from one of their trips together. </p><p>What Carol had said earlier was echoing through her head. Knowing that she had hurt him, caused him pain, tore a hole in her heart. That was the last thing she wanted. </p><p>In a vain attempt to mend that hole as best she could, Y/n set the bag down, taking a seat in her chair and pulled out a pen and paper. In rushed words, she tried her best to explain that she would be gone for a while. That she would come back when the time was right, but that she loved him. She loved everyone and didn&rsquo;t mean to cause any pain. </p><p>Setting the pen down, she placed the note on her keyboard along with her phone. They didn&rsquo;t need to know where she was until she was ready. Standing from the chair, she grabbed the bag and headed out. </p><p>Many may have thought that what she was doing was running. Running away from her problems like she always did, but it wasn&rsquo;t like that. She intended to return. If she kept running, she would never be one with herself and never face her problems. And as much as everyone was probably willing to help her with that, it wasn&rsquo;t something that they needed to do. It was something she needed to do on her own. </p><p>Exiting the building, Y/n turned back, silently wishing everyone well until she returned. She didn&rsquo;t know how long she would be gone, but when she returned she would be the person she was always meant to be. </p><p>Turning away, she started into a sprint, gripping her bag like it was her lifeline, before disappearing into the night.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p><b>(Let me know if you want to be added to the taglist and I love to get feedback.
