        "body": "<h1>The Doctor Is In</h1><p><b>(5 times Stephen took care of Tony and Peter and 1 time they took care of him)</b></p><p>Stephen fled from the Tower the moment heavy metal music echoed through the surrounding floors of the lab. It wasn&rsquo;t that he hated the music, it was the fact that he knew exactly what it meant.</p><p>Tony and Peter were blowing things up.</p><p>He could meditate through a majority of things that went on in the Tower. Like if Clint and Sam took over their living room to play video games, Peter crawling all over the ceiling, Tony\u00a0 cursing at something he&rsquo;s tinkering with on the coffee table&hellip;or Clint crawling through the air vents. Their floor was constantly taken over by the other Avengers, and he had grown used to it, but explosions from the lab was another thing entirely. It was random and had different levels of noise that startled Stephen&rsquo;s astral form back into his body and left him momentarily confused and disoriented. Not a fun feeling.</p><p>Stephen sighs when Wong drops a stack of books on the table in front of him and he opens a single eye. &ldquo;Do you mind?&rdquo;</p><p>Wong ignores him as he sits down. &ldquo;AC/DC?&rdquo;</p><p>The sorcerer supreme stretches out in his chair. &ldquo;Metallica.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t blasting music hurt Peter&rsquo;s ears?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s used to it. He&rsquo;s usually the one controlling the volume anyway.&rdquo; Stephen slumps in his chair.</p><p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s motherhood treating you?&rdquo; Wong grins.</p><p>Strange groans. &ldquo;Not you too. How did you know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony calls you Mama Bear almost all the time. It was obvious.&rdquo; Wong flips through one of the books. &ldquo;&hellip;and I heard Peter call you Mom.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That boy will be the death of me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought I saw some more grey hair.&rdquo;</p><p>He wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised. Both Peter and Tony had very little consideration for self-preservation to the point that&hellip;well&hellip;they were blowing things up in the lab. He could confidently bet the Eye of Agamotto that he would go home to at least one of them in need of first aid. Bruce only helped them in emergencies for how often they got themselves into trouble. He was tired of fishing glass out of broken skin because of a stupid idea.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tempted to cover them in bubble wrap so I can have a minute of peace without having to worry about what trouble they&rsquo;re getting into.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your domesticity is nauseating.&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen smirks. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just jealous.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hardly.&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen&rsquo;s phone starts ringing and he looks at the screen, sighs, and answers.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes Spiderling?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Holy crap! Where are you?! Dad got knocked out by the fire extinguisher&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen coughs to hide his laugh. He was definitely going to watch today&rsquo;s recording of the lab to see how that happened. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be there shortly.&rdquo;</p><p>He hangs up before Peter can utter another word and glances at Wong.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the damage this time?&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen grins. &ldquo;Technical knockout by a fire extinguisher.&rdquo;</p><p>Wong laughs.</p><p>_______________________</p><p>&ldquo;Peter I swear&ndash;&rdquo; A Lego smacks painlessly against Stephen&rsquo;s forehead. &ldquo;Did you just throw a Lego at me?!&rdquo;</p><p>The teen flattens himself against the ceiling. &ldquo;That was my venom! I&rsquo;m a spider!&rdquo;</p><p><i>The Vishanti are testing me.</i></p><p>Peter had just recently gotten all of his wisdom teeth pulled and was on very strong pain killers. Something Stephen prayed he would never have to give the boy again because he was a <i>menace</i>. Peter refused to stay in bed and had taken to the ceiling instead, leaving Stephen no choice but to follow him and try to coax him down. He hoped to whatever entity that was listening that the boy wouldn&rsquo;t fall and hurt himself.</p><p>The first thing he tried was Levi but Peter stubbornly clung to the ceiling so he had to wave the cloak off from that attempt. Bribing him with ice cream was a dead end as well.</p><p>&ldquo;Spiderling, you don&rsquo;t spit venom.&rdquo; Then another idea came to mind and Stephen didn&rsquo;t know why he didn&rsquo;t think if it before. &ldquo;How does a movie night with cuddles sound?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter looks at the sorcerer and seems to think over his offer. &ldquo;&lsquo;Kay.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter was a sucker for physical contact no matter how high he was.</p><p>Stephen sighs with relief when the teen moves down from the ceiling and immediately clings to the older man&rsquo;s front like a baby. The sorcerer wraps his arms around Peter to hold him steady, and makes his way back to the boy&rsquo;s bedroom where he gently deposits his burden. He murmurs to the boy to stay while he leaves to change into something more comfortable, and thankfully returns to Peter&rsquo;s room a couple minutes later to find the boy curled up under his blankets.</p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Dad?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;At an Accords meeting. He&rsquo;ll be back by dinner.&rdquo; Strange slips into bed next to Peter and the teen wastes no time in curling up against him. &ldquo;What do you want to watch Spider-Baby?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Disney movie.&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen has Karen (Tony connected Peter&rsquo;s AI to his bedroom) start a Disney movie, and gently strokes brown curls. It didn&rsquo;t take long for Peter to pass out between the ministrations and snuggling. One would think the boy was touch starved.</p><p>_____________ </p><p>The tower was calm. Peter was at school and Tony was at a meeting, so Stephen felt he could relax. He really should have known better. As soon as he stretched out on the couch with an actual book not related to the mystic artes, Tony strode out of the elevator with blood streaming down his temple. The sorcerer sighs when his boyfriend flops onto the couch when he sits up, and he retrieves the first aid kit and some ice through a couple of small portals.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d ask how your meeting went but that would be pointless.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony hisses when Stephen applies some antiseptic. &ldquo;The meeting was fine. The private meeting Ross wanted&hellip;not so much.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just say the word and I can have him free-falling for a couple of hours.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That would be counter productive since I&rsquo;m trying to keep you and Peter out of the Accords. You&rsquo;re both special cases.&rdquo; </p><p>The doctor finishes by applying a butterfly bandage and then hands Tony the ice. The engineer did have legitimate reasons for keeping Stephen and Peter away. Stephen was the Sorcerer Supreme, and had a responsibility to protect the world from magical attacks. Peter was simply underage.</p><p>&ldquo;Head feeling better?&rdquo; Stephen asks softly.</p><p>Tony nods and grimaces as he places the ice pack on his head. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll live.&rdquo;</p><p>Scott slips into the living room and sits in an armchair sipping at a juice pouch. &ldquo;Hey Strange, your Mama Bear is showing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That better not be Peter&rsquo;s Capri Sun.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Case and point.&rdquo; He grins and loudly sucks every last drop.</p><p>&ldquo;Quit raiding my fridge Lang.&rdquo; Tony snarks.</p><p>&ldquo;Quit buying all the good stuff.&rdquo; Scott kicks his legs up onto the coffee table and turns on the t.v.</p><p>Stephen simply laid out on the couch again with his legs across Tony&rsquo;s lap and read while the other two watched reruns of Friends. He would take the quiet while he could. It was a rare occurrence.</p><p>____________________</p><p>&ldquo;Doctor Strange, you have an incoming call from Peter.&rdquo; Victor calls from his bracelet.</p><p>Stephen sighs and puts his tea down to pull his phone out of his pocket. He was at school so either he had gotten into trouble (Not likely unless it was an attack an earth kind) or he wasn&rsquo;t feeling well. Something still unlikely because of the spider bite.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong Spiderling?&rdquo; The sorcerer asks when he accepts the call.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh&hellip;Doctor Strange?&rdquo; That was not Peter. In fact it sounded like&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;Ned? Where&rsquo;s Peter?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in the boy&rsquo;s bathroom on the second floor. I think Peter is going through a sensory overload.&rdquo;</p><p>Shit. That was the one thing that Peter truly hated. &ldquo;Alright. I&rsquo;ll be there in just a minute.&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen hangs up, uses his magic to change into his street clothes, and then opens a portal to just around the corner to the school. With long strides, he shoves his way through pedestrians and into the school and makes a quick stop in the office. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to pick up Peter Parker.&rdquo; The secretary looks up, blushes, and reaches for the intercom phone until Stephen reaches out and stops her. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;s not feeling well and the intercom will only make things worse. I know where he is if I may go get him myself.&rdquo;</p><p>The woman quickly gathers herself. &ldquo;Of course sir. I just need your name and have you sign him out.&rdquo;</p><p>When he relayed his name to her, she looked at him with a mixture of confusion and skepticism, but thankfully cleared him to retrieve Peter. She was probably wondering where his robes were since he was dressed like any other person.</p><p>Stephen rushes out of the office and up the stairs and to his relief finds the bathrooms fairly quickly. He wrinkles his nose in disgust as he walks in but says nothing when he spots Peter curled in the corner with his hands over his ears. Ned looks up and relief crosses his features as he promptly moves away from his best friend and the doctor takes his place and gently pulls Peter&rsquo;s hands down.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you home in just a second Spiderling.&rdquo; Strange looks up at Ned and accepts Peter&rsquo;s backpack from him. &ldquo;Thank you for calling me.&rdquo;</p><p>Ned nods. &ldquo;I can call him later and tell him what his homework is.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he would appreciate that.&rdquo;</p><p>He then turns and opens a portal, the sound of the sparks drawing a whimper from the suffering teen beside him, and Stephen ignores his breaking heart as he helps Peter through. He closes the portal and leads the teen to his bed where Peter quickly sheds everything but his boxers to, Stephen assumed, get rid of his itchy clothing.</p><p>&ldquo;Karen, Overload Protocol please.&rdquo;</p><p>In an instant, the window is covered, the lights are dimmed, and Peter finally relaxes when the room is soundproof and nearly dark. Stephen gently lays the covers over his son and Peter cracks open an eye in response.</p><p>&ldquo;Mom?&rdquo; Peter croaks out. </p><p>&ldquo;Just relax Spider-Baby.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nods and rolls onto his side before settling against his pillow.</p><p>_____________________</p><p>An explosion startles both Stephen and Happy from their naps on their respective couches, and both jump to their feet before rushing down to the lab. The sorcerer punches in the code to open the lab door and he looks around the trashed and smoking lab for Peter and Tony, faintly registering that DUM-E was successfully taking care of any fires. He soons spots the engineer slumped against the wall and he rushes over before kneeling down to examine him and tend to his injuries.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got Peter!&rdquo; The bodyguard yells from the other side of the room. &ldquo;He looks fine. Just knocked out!&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen exhales when he finds Tony in the same condition. &ldquo;Tony is the same. It must have been a repulsor explosion.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony groans and slowly opens his eyes. &ldquo;Peter&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s alright. What happened?&rdquo;</p><p>The billionaire stands with the doctor&rsquo;s help and rubs the back of his head. &ldquo;One of my gauntlets short-circuited.&rdquo;</p><p>Happy approaches them with a smirk. &ldquo;The kid just woke up and he&rsquo;s talking a mile a minute. I&rsquo;m pretty sure he&rsquo;s fine. I&rsquo;m going back upstairs to finish my nap.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony rolls his eyes as Happy leaves the lab and both parents walk over to Peter to find him patting DUM-E.</p><p>&ldquo;Good job putting out the fire buddy. Now Dad won&rsquo;t have to donate you to a community college.&rdquo; The robot trills at the praise.</p><p>&ldquo;Now FRIDAY is risking reprogramming.&rdquo; Tony says irritably.</p><p>&ldquo;I tried to warn you Boss but you didn&rsquo;t listen.&rdquo; Could AI be annoyed? FRIDAY definitely sounded annoyed.</p><p>&ldquo;That sounds like something you would do.&rdquo; Stephen drawls and Tony throws his arms up.</p><p>&ldquo;Traitors! I&rsquo;m scrapping FRIDAY and breaking up with you!&rdquo;</p><p>Peter looks up at Tony&rsquo;s declaration and watches the couple in alarm, but Stephen simply smiles and the teen relaxes and turns his attention back to DUM-E. The poor kid really feared that his family was going to fall apart over something trivial and it hurt Stephen. It really showed how much Peter loved them.</p><p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t have anyone to kiss your boo-boos then.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony stares at Stephen until he barks out a laugh that turns into something hysterical. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. Brucie isn&rsquo;t the type.&rdquo; He finally wheezes out.</p><p>Stephen then decided to take it a step further. &ldquo;Besides, if we break up, I&rsquo;m taking Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>The boy himself pouts. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t drag me into your marital problems.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, first of all kid, we have to be married to have marital problems. Second, Stephanie, he was my kid first.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You guys might as well get married. You already act like an old married couple.&rdquo; Peter grumbles and the older two glance at each other.</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;and <i>there&rsquo;s</i> the headache I get from dealing with you two.&rdquo; Stephen says and rubs his temples.</p><p>_____________________</p><p>+1</p><p>Stephen groggily opens his eyes when a cool hand finds itself on his forehead and he <i>purrs</i> when he finds Tony leaning over him. Something he would completely deny later because he wasn&rsquo;t even aware he could even make that noise.</p><p>&ldquo;Feeling under the weather Mama Bear?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll believe that when you stop trying to hack up a lung while you&rsquo;re sleeping.&rdquo;</p><p>The sorcerer bats Tony&rsquo;s hand away and sits up, only for his boyfriend&rsquo;s hand to settle on his chest to stop him from getting up. It was weird for him to be fussed over and he also wasn&rsquo;t about to let a cold keep him from the research he needed to do.</p><p>&ldquo;If you put one foot on the floor I am going to sic Peter on you.&rdquo;</p><p>That actually got Stephen&rsquo;s attention. Tony had gotten sick a few weeks back and when Peter got wind of it, he hovered. The teen took it upon himself to make sure that the engineer took some medicine, fed him, and even checked in on him to make sure he was resting. Stephen found it hilarious and let the boy help take care of Tony as long as he didn&rsquo;t disturb him.</p><p>To be on the receiving end of that though? That was a scary thought. He was the doctor in the family. He was supposed to worry about them, no matter how many headaches that might cause, not the other way around.</p><p>So he laid back down. </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I thought. The only acceptable reason for you to get out of bed is for the bathroom.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Asshole.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too Mama Bear. Now let us take care of you.&rdquo; Tony kisses his forehead. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send Peter in with some water and pills.&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen glares up at him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to let him hover anyway?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony frowns. &ldquo;He already knows you&rsquo;re sick. He promised not to hover.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;fine.&rdquo;</p><p>After Tony left the bedroom, Stephen expected Peter to stumble in a couple minutes later.</p><p>He never did.</p><p>Tony was the one to bring him whatever he needed, and the doctor immediately knew something was wrong. It took him a few minutes to think about what happened, but then he finally remembered Peter&rsquo;s enhanced hearing. The boy probably heard his parents&rsquo; earlier conversation and assumed Stephen didn&rsquo;t want to be bothered by him and decided to stay away and respect his wishes.</p><p>Just the thought squeezed the sorcerer&rsquo;s heart painfully.</p><p>Precious, wonderful Peter ignored his own insecurities so Mom could rest without disruption.</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s cellphone ringing pulls Stephen out of his own head and he watches as the older man looks at the screen. He grimaces in irritation before pocketing the phone and places a glass of water on the nightstand by Stephen.</p><p>&ldquo;Pepper needs me for something SI related.&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen waves him away. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be fine. I&rsquo;ll have FRIDAY annoy Bruce if I need something.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony opens his mouth as if to say something but seems to think better of it and closes his mouth again. Stephen relaxes against his pillow when the billionaire leaves and allows himself to doze off until a thud and a soft curse wakes him later in the evening. Blue eyes blink open at the disturbance and he immediately makes eye contact with doe-like brown eyes wide with horror.</p><p>&ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m sorry. I didn&rsquo;t mean to wake you! I&rsquo;m only in here because Dad asked me to check on you. Y-You&rsquo;re obviously fine so I&rsquo;ll&hellip;go. Yeah.&rdquo; Peter turns to leave and Stephen quickly reaches out and grabs his sleeve.</p><p>&ldquo;Come here Spiderling.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I swear I wasn&rsquo;t hovering!&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen smiles softly and pulls the younger onto the bed next to him. &ldquo;You can watch tv if you want&hellip;just keep me company.&rdquo;</p><p>The horror slowly eases away as the sorcerer pulls him into a hug, and Peter quietly turns on the tv with low volume. If this wasn&rsquo;t enough to show his son he wasn&rsquo;t bothered, he didn&rsquo;t know what was. He really did need the company though. After living in the chaos of the tower for months, the quiet was unnerving.</p><p>Stephen found that he really didn&rsquo;t mind.</p>",

Bribing him with ice cream was a dead end as well.</p><p>\u201cSpiderling, you don\u2019t spit venom.\u201d Then another idea came to mind and Stephen didn\u2019t know why he didn\u2019t think if it before. \u201cHow does a movie night with cuddles sound?\u201d</p><p>Peter looks at the sorcerer and seems to think over his offer. \u201c\u2018Kay.\u201d</p><p>Peter was a sucker for physical contact no matter how high he was.</p><p>Stephen sighs with relief when the teen moves down from the ceiling and immediately clings to the older man\u2019s front like a baby. The sorcerer wraps his arms around Peter to hold him steady, and makes his way back to the boy\u2019s bedroom where he gently deposits his burden. He murmurs to the boy to stay while he leaves to change into something more comfortable, and thankfully returns to Peter\u2019s room a couple minutes later to find the boy curled up under his blankets.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt an Accords meeting. He\u2019ll be back by dinner.\u201d Strange slips into bed next to Peter and the teen wastes no time in curling up against him. \u201cWhat do you want to watch Spider-Baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDisney movie.\u201d</p><p>Stephen has Karen (Tony connected Peter\u2019s AI to his bedroom) start a Disney movie, and gently strokes brown curls. It didn\u2019t take long for Peter to pass out between the ministrations and snuggling. One would think the boy was touch starved.</p><p>_____________ </p><p>The tower was calm. Peter was at school and Tony was at a meeting, so Stephen felt he could relax. He really should have known better. As soon as he stretched out on the couch with an actual book not related to the mystic artes, Tony strode out of the elevator with blood streaming down his temple. The sorcerer sighs when his boyfriend flops onto the couch when he sits up, and he retrieves the first aid kit and some ice through a couple of small portals.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d ask how your meeting went but that would be pointless.\u201d</p><p>Tony hisses when Stephen applies some antiseptic. \u201cThe meeting was fine. The private meeting Ross wanted\u2026not so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust say the word and I can have him free-falling for a couple of hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be counter productive since I\u2019m trying to keep you and Peter out of the Accords. You\u2019re both special cases.\u201d </p><p>The doctor finishes by applying a butterfly bandage and then hands Tony the ice. The engineer did have legitimate reasons for keeping Stephen and Peter away. Stephen was the Sorcerer Supreme, and had a responsibility to protect the world from magical attacks. Peter was simply underage.</p><p>\u201cHead feeling better?\u201d Stephen asks softly.</p><p>Tony nods and grimaces as he places the ice pack on his head. \u201cI think I\u2019ll live.\u201d</p><p>Scott slips into the living room and sits in an armchair sipping at a juice pouch. \u201cHey Strange, your Mama Bear is showing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat better not be Peter\u2019s Capri Sun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCase and point.\u201d He grins and loudly sucks every last drop.</p><p>\u201cQuit raiding my fridge Lang.\u201d Tony snarks.</p><p>\u201cQuit buying all the good stuff.\u201d Scott kicks his legs up onto the coffee table and turns on the t.v.</p><p>Stephen simply laid out on the couch again with his legs across Tony\u2019s lap and read while the other two watched reruns of Friends. He would take the quiet while he could. It was a rare occurrence.</p><p>____________________</p><p>\u201cDoctor Strange, you have an incoming call from Peter.\u201d Victor calls from his bracelet.</p><p>Stephen sighs and puts his tea down to pull his phone out of his pocket. He was at school so either he had gotten into trouble (Not likely unless it was an attack an earth kind) or he wasn\u2019t feeling well. Something still unlikely because of the spider bite.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong Spiderling?\u201d The sorcerer asks when he accepts the call.</p><p>\u201cUh\u2026Doctor Strange?\u201d That was not Peter. In fact it sounded like\u2026</p><p>\u201cNed? Where\u2019s Peter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in the boy\u2019s bathroom on the second floor. I think Peter is going through a sensory overload.\u201d</p><p>Shit. That was the one thing that Peter truly hated. \u201cAlright. I\u2019ll be there in just a minute.\u201d</p><p>Stephen hangs up, uses his magic to change into his street clothes, and then opens a portal to just around the corner to the school. With long strides, he shoves his way through pedestrians and into the school and makes a quick stop in the office. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to pick up Peter Parker.\u201d The secretary looks up, blushes, and reaches for the intercom phone until Stephen reaches out and stops her. \u201cPlease don\u2019t. He\u2019s not feeling well and the intercom will only make things worse. I know where he is if I may go get him myself.\u201d</p><p>The woman quickly gathers herself. \u201cOf course sir. I just need your name and have you sign him out.\u201d</p><p>When he relayed his name to her, she looked at him with a mixture of confusion and skepticism, but thankfully cleared him to retrieve Peter. She was probably wondering where his robes were since he was dressed like any other person.</p><p>Stephen rushes out of the office and up the stairs and to his relief finds the bathrooms fairly quickly. He wrinkles his nose in disgust as he walks in but says nothing when he spots Peter curled in the corner with his hands over his ears. Ned looks up and relief crosses his features as he promptly moves away from his best friend and the doctor takes his place and gently pulls Peter\u2019s hands down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you home in just a second Spiderling.\u201d Strange looks up at Ned and accepts Peter\u2019s backpack from him. \u201cThank you for calling me.\u201d</p><p>Ned nods. \u201cI can call him later and tell him what his homework is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he would appreciate that.\u201d</p><p>He then turns and opens a portal, the sound of the sparks drawing a whimper from the suffering teen beside him, and Stephen ignores his breaking heart as he helps Peter through. He closes the portal and leads the teen to his bed where Peter quickly sheds everything but his boxers to, Stephen assumed, get rid of his itchy clothing.</p><p>\u201cKaren, Overload Protocol please.\u201d</p><p>In an instant, the window is covered, the lights are dimmed, and Peter finally relaxes when the room is soundproof and nearly dark. Stephen gently lays the covers over his son and Peter cracks open an eye in response.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d Peter croaks out. </p><p>\u201cJust relax Spider-Baby.\u201d</p><p>Peter nods and rolls onto his side before settling against his pillow.</p><p>_____________________</p><p>An explosion startles both Stephen and Happy from their naps on their respective couches, and both jump to their feet before rushing down to the lab. The sorcerer punches in the code to open the lab door and he looks around the trashed and smoking lab for Peter and Tony, faintly registering that DUM-E was successfully taking care of any fires. He soons spots the engineer slumped against the wall and he rushes over before kneeling down to examine him and tend to his injuries.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got Peter!\u201d The bodyguard yells from the other side of the room. \u201cHe looks fine. Just knocked out!\u201d</p><p>Stephen exhales when he finds Tony in the same condition. \u201cTony is the same. It must have been a repulsor explosion.\u201d</p><p>Tony groans and slowly opens his eyes. \u201cPeter\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s alright. What happened?\u201d</p><p>The billionaire stands with the doctor\u2019s help and rubs the back of his head. \u201cOne of my gauntlets short-circuited.\u201d</p><p>Happy approaches them with a smirk. \u201cThe kid just woke up and he\u2019s talking a mile a minute. I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s fine. I\u2019m going back upstairs to finish my nap.\u201d</p><p>Tony rolls his eyes as Happy leaves the lab and both parents walk over to Peter to find him patting DUM-E.</p><p>\u201cGood job putting out the fire buddy. Now Dad won\u2019t have to donate you to a community college.\u201d The robot trills at the praise.</p><p>\u201cNow FRIDAY is risking reprogramming.\u201d Tony says irritably.</p><p>\u201cI tried to warn you Boss but you didn\u2019t listen.\u201d Could AI be annoyed? FRIDAY definitely sounded annoyed.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like something you would do.\u201d Stephen drawls and Tony throws his arms up.</p><p>\u201cTraitors! I\u2019m scrapping FRIDAY and breaking up with you!\u201d</p><p>Peter looks up at Tony\u2019s declaration and watches the couple in alarm, but Stephen simply smiles and the teen relaxes and turns his attention back to DUM-E. The poor kid really feared that his family was going to fall apart over something trivial and it hurt Stephen. It really showed how much Peter loved them.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t have anyone to kiss your boo-boos then.\u201d</p><p>Tony stares at Stephen until he barks out a laugh that turns into something hysterical. \u201cThat\u2019s true. Brucie isn\u2019t the type.\u201d He finally wheezes out.</p><p>Stephen then decided to take it a step further. \u201cBesides, if we break up, I\u2019m taking Peter.\u201d</p><p>The boy himself pouts. \u201cDon\u2019t drag me into your marital problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, first of all kid, we have to be married to have marital problems. Second, Stephanie, he was my kid first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys might as well get married. You already act like an old married couple.\u201d Peter grumbles and the older two glance at each other.</p><p>\u201c\u2026and <i>there\u2019s</i> the headache I get from dealing with you two.\u201d Stephen says and rubs his temples.</p><p>_____________________</p><p>+1</p><p>Stephen groggily opens his eyes when a cool hand finds itself on his forehead and he <i>purrs</i> when he finds Tony leaning over him. Something he would completely deny later because he wasn\u2019t even aware he could even make that noise.</p><p>\u201cFeeling under the weather Mama Bear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll believe that when you stop trying to hack up a lung while you\u2019re sleeping.\u201d</p><p>The sorcerer bats Tony\u2019s hand away and sits up, only for his boyfriend\u2019s hand to settle on his chest to stop him from getting up. It was weird for him to be fussed over and he also wasn\u2019t about to let a cold keep him from the research he needed to do.</p><p>\u201cIf you put one foot on the floor I am going to sic Peter on you.\u201d</p><p>That actually got Stephen\u2019s attention. Tony had gotten sick a few weeks back and when Peter got wind of it, he hovered. The teen took it upon himself to make sure that the engineer took some medicine, fed him, and even checked in on him to make sure he was resting. Stephen found it hilarious and let the boy help take care of Tony as long as he didn\u2019t disturb him.</p><p>To be on the receiving end of that though? That was a scary thought. He was the doctor in the family. He was supposed to worry about them, no matter how many headaches that might cause, not the other way around.</p><p>So he laid back down. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. The only acceptable reason for you to get out of bed is for the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too Mama Bear. Now let us take care of you.\u201d Tony kisses his forehead. \u201cI\u2019ll send Peter in with some water and pills.\u201d</p><p>Stephen glares up at him. \u201cYou\u2019re going to let him hover anyway?\u201d</p><p>Tony frowns. \u201cHe already knows you\u2019re sick. He promised not to hover.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026fine.\u201d</p><p>After Tony left the bedroom, Stephen expected Peter to stumble in a couple minutes later.</p><p>He never did.</p><p>Tony was the one to bring him whatever he needed, and the doctor immediately knew something was wrong. It took him a few minutes to think about what happened, but then he finally remembered Peter\u2019s enhanced hearing. The boy probably heard his parents\u2019 earlier conversation and assumed Stephen didn\u2019t want to be bothered by him and decided to stay away and respect his wishes.</p><p>Just the thought squeezed the sorcerer\u2019s heart painfully.</p><p>Precious, wonderful Peter ignored his own insecurities so Mom could rest without disruption.</p><p>Tony\u2019s cellphone ringing pulls Stephen out of his own head and he watches as the older man looks at the screen. He grimaces in irritation before pocketing the phone and places a glass of water on the nightstand by Stephen.</p><p>\u201cPepper needs me for something SI related.\u201d</p><p>Stephen waves him away. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ll have FRIDAY annoy Bruce if I need something.\u201d</p><p>Tony opens his mouth as if to say something but seems to think better of it and closes his mouth again. Stephen relaxes against his pillow when the billionaire leaves and allows himself to doze off until a thud and a soft curse wakes him later in the evening. Blue eyes blink open at the disturbance and he immediately makes eye contact with doe-like brown eyes wide with horror.</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to wake you! I\u2019m only in here because Dad asked me to check on you. Y-You\u2019re obviously fine so I\u2019ll\u2026go. Yeah.\u201d Peter turns to leave and Stephen quickly reaches out and grabs his sleeve.</p><p>\u201cCome here Spiderling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear I wasn\u2019t hovering!\u201d</p><p>Stephen smiles softly and pulls the younger onto the bed next to him. \u201cYou can watch tv if you want\u2026just keep me company.\u201d</p><p>The horror slowly eases away as the sorcerer pulls him into a hug, and Peter quietly turns on the tv with low volume. If this wasn\u2019t enough to show his son he wasn\u2019t bothered, he didn\u2019t know what was. He really did need the company though. After living in the chaos of the tower for months, the quiet was unnerving.</p><p>Stephen found that he really didn\u2019t mind.</p></p>",

It wasn\u2019t that he hated the music, it was the fact that he knew exactly what it meant.</p><p>Tony and Peter were blowing things up.</p><p>He could meditate through a majority of things that went on in the Tower. Like if Clint and Sam took over their living room to play video games, Peter crawling all over the ceiling, Tony\u00a0 cursing at something he\u2019s tinkering with on the coffee table\u2026or Clint crawling through the air vents. Their floor was constantly taken over by the other Avengers, and he had grown used to it, but explosions from the lab was another thing entirely. It was random and had different levels of noise that startled Stephen\u2019s astral form back into his body and left him momentarily confused and disoriented. Not a fun feeling.</p><p>Stephen sighs when Wong drops a stack of books on the table in front of him and he opens a single eye. \u201cDo you mind?\u201d</p><p>Wong ignores him as he sits down. \u201cAC/DC?\u201d</p><p>The sorcerer supreme stretches out in his chair. \u201cMetallica.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t blasting music hurt Peter\u2019s ears?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s used to it. He\u2019s usually the one controlling the volume anyway.\u201d Stephen slumps in his chair.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s motherhood treating you?\u201d Wong grins.</p><p>Strange groans. \u201cNot you too. How did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony calls you Mama Bear almost all the time. It was obvious.\u201d Wong flips through one of the books. \u201c\u2026and I heard Peter call you Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat boy will be the death of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I saw some more grey hair.\u201d</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t be surprised. Both Peter and Tony had very little consideration for self-preservation to the point that\u2026well\u2026they were blowing things up in the lab. He could confidently bet the Eye of Agamotto that he would go home to at least one of them in need of first aid. Bruce only helped them in emergencies for how often they got themselves into trouble. He was tired of fishing glass out of broken skin because of a stupid idea.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tempted to cover them in bubble wrap so I can have a minute of peace without having to worry about what trouble they\u2019re getting into.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour domesticity is nauseating.\u201d</p><p>Stephen smirks. \u201cYou\u2019re just jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly.\u201d</p><p>Stephen\u2019s phone starts ringing and he looks at the screen, sighs, and answers.</p><p>\u201cYes Spiderling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly crap! Where are you?! Dad got knocked out by the fire extinguisher\u2013\u201d</p><p>Stephen coughs to hide his laugh. He was definitely going to watch today\u2019s recording of the lab to see how that happened. \u201cI\u2019ll be there shortly.\u201d</p><p>He hangs up before Peter can utter another word and glances at Wong.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the damage this time?\u201d</p><p>Stephen grins. \u201cTechnical knockout by a fire extinguisher.\u201d</p><p>Wong laughs.</p><p>_______________________</p><p>\u201cPeter I swear\u2013\u201d A Lego smacks painlessly against Stephen\u2019s forehead. \u201cDid you just throw a Lego at me?!\u201d</p><p>The teen flattens himself against the ceiling. \u201cThat was my venom! I\u2019m a spider!\u201d</p><p><i>The Vishanti are testing me.</i></p><p>Peter had just recently gotten all of his wisdom teeth pulled and was on very strong pain killers. Something Stephen prayed he would never have to give the boy again because he was a <i>menace</i>. Peter refused to stay in bed and had taken to the ceiling instead, leaving Stephen no choice but to follow him and try to coax him down. He hoped to whatever entity that was listening that the boy wouldn\u2019t fall and hurt himself.</p><p>The first thing he tried was Levi but Peter stubbornly clung to the ceiling so he had to wave the cloak off from that attempt. Bribing him with ice cream was a dead end as well.</p><p>\u201cSpiderling, you don\u2019t spit venom.\u201d Then another idea came to mind and Stephen didn\u2019t know why he didn\u2019t think if it before. \u201cHow does a movie night with cuddles sound?\u201d</p><p>Peter looks at the sorcerer and seems to think over his offer. \u201c\u2018Kay.\u201d</p><p>Peter was a sucker for physical contact no matter how high he was.</p><p>Stephen sighs with relief when the teen moves down from the ceiling and immediately clings to the older man\u2019s front like a baby. The sorcerer wraps his arms around Peter to hold him steady, and makes his way back to the boy\u2019s bedroom where he gently deposits his burden. He murmurs to the boy to stay while he leaves to change into something more comfortable, and thankfully returns to Peter\u2019s room a couple minutes later to find the boy curled up under his blankets.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt an Accords meeting. He\u2019ll be back by dinner.\u201d Strange slips into bed next to Peter and the teen wastes no time in curling up against him. \u201cWhat do you want to watch Spider-Baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDisney movie.\u201d</p><p>Stephen has Karen (Tony connected Peter\u2019s AI to his bedroom) start a Disney movie, and gently strokes brown curls. It didn\u2019t take long for Peter to pass out between the ministrations and snuggling. One would think the boy was touch starved.</p><p>_____________ </p><p>The tower was calm. Peter was at school and Tony was at a meeting, so Stephen felt he could relax. He really should have known better. As soon as he stretched out on the couch with an actual book not related to the mystic artes, Tony strode out of the elevator with blood streaming down his temple. The sorcerer sighs when his boyfriend flops onto the couch when he sits up, and he retrieves the first aid kit and some ice through a couple of small portals.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d ask how your meeting went but that would be pointless.\u201d</p><p>Tony hisses when Stephen applies some antiseptic. \u201cThe meeting was fine. The private meeting Ross wanted\u2026not so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust say the word and I can have him free-falling for a couple of hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be counter productive since I\u2019m trying to keep you and Peter out of the Accords. You\u2019re both special cases.\u201d </p><p>The doctor finishes by applying a butterfly bandage and then hands Tony the ice. The engineer did have legitimate reasons for keeping Stephen and Peter away. Stephen was the Sorcerer Supreme, and had a responsibility to protect the world from magical attacks. Peter was simply underage.</p><p>\u201cHead feeling better?\u201d Stephen asks softly.</p><p>Tony nods and grimaces as he places the ice pack on his head. \u201cI think I\u2019ll live.\u201d</p><p>Scott slips into the living room and sits in an armchair sipping at a juice pouch. \u201cHey Strange, your Mama Bear is showing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat better not be Peter\u2019s Capri Sun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCase and point.\u201d He grins and loudly sucks every last drop.</p><p>\u201cQuit raiding my fridge Lang.\u201d Tony snarks.</p><p>\u201cQuit buying all the good stuff.\u201d Scott kicks his legs up onto the coffee table and turns on the t.v.</p><p>Stephen simply laid out on the couch again with his legs across Tony\u2019s lap and read while the other two watched reruns of Friends. He would take the quiet while he could. It was a rare occurrence.</p><p>____________________</p><p>\u201cDoctor Strange, you have an incoming call from Peter.\u201d Victor calls from his bracelet.</p><p>Stephen sighs and puts his tea down to pull his phone out of his pocket. He was at school so either he had gotten into trouble (Not likely unless it was an attack an earth kind) or he wasn\u2019t feeling well. Something still unlikely because of the spider bite.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong Spiderling?\u201d The sorcerer asks when he accepts the call.</p><p>\u201cUh\u2026Doctor Strange?\u201d That was not Peter. In fact it sounded like\u2026</p><p>\u201cNed? Where\u2019s Peter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in the boy\u2019s bathroom on the second floor. I think Peter is going through a sensory overload.\u201d</p><p>Shit. That was the one thing that Peter truly hated. \u201cAlright. I\u2019ll be there in just a minute.\u201d</p><p>Stephen hangs up, uses his magic to change into his street clothes, and then opens a portal to just around the corner to the school. With long strides, he shoves his way through pedestrians and into the school and makes a quick stop in the office. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to pick up Peter Parker.\u201d The secretary looks up, blushes, and reaches for the intercom phone until Stephen reaches out and stops her. \u201cPlease don\u2019t. He\u2019s not feeling well and the intercom will only make things worse. I know where he is if I may go get him myself.\u201d</p><p>The woman quickly gathers herself. \u201cOf course sir. I just need your name and have you sign him out.\u201d</p><p>When he relayed his name to her, she looked at him with a mixture of confusion and skepticism, but thankfully cleared him to retrieve Peter. She was probably wondering where his robes were since he was dressed like any other person.</p><p>Stephen rushes out of the office and up the stairs and to his relief finds the bathrooms fairly quickly. He wrinkles his nose in disgust as he walks in but says nothing when he spots Peter curled in the corner with his hands over his ears. Ned looks up and relief crosses his features as he promptly moves away from his best friend and the doctor takes his place and gently pulls Peter\u2019s hands down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you home in just a second Spiderling.\u201d Strange looks up at Ned and accepts Peter\u2019s backpack from him. \u201cThank you for calling me.\u201d</p><p>Ned nods. \u201cI can call him later and tell him what his homework is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he would appreciate that.\u201d</p><p>He then turns and opens a portal, the sound of the sparks drawing a whimper from the suffering teen beside him, and Stephen ignores his breaking heart as he helps Peter through. He closes the portal and leads the teen to his bed where Peter quickly sheds everything but his boxers to, Stephen assumed, get rid of his itchy clothing.</p><p>\u201cKaren, Overload Protocol please.\u201d</p><p>In an instant, the window is covered, the lights are dimmed, and Peter finally relaxes when the room is soundproof and nearly dark. Stephen gently lays the covers over his son and Peter cracks open an eye in response.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d Peter croaks out. </p><p>\u201cJust relax Spider-Baby.\u201d</p><p>Peter nods and rolls onto his side before settling against his pillow.</p><p>_____________________</p><p>An explosion startles both Stephen and Happy from their naps on their respective couches, and both jump to their feet before rushing down to the lab. The sorcerer punches in the code to open the lab door and he looks around the trashed and smoking lab for Peter and Tony, faintly registering that DUM-E was successfully taking care of any fires. He soons spots the engineer slumped against the wall and he rushes over before kneeling down to examine him and tend to his injuries.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got Peter!\u201d The bodyguard yells from the other side of the room. \u201cHe looks fine. Just knocked out!\u201d</p><p>Stephen exhales when he finds Tony in the same condition. \u201cTony is the same. It must have been a repulsor explosion.\u201d</p><p>Tony groans and slowly opens his eyes. \u201cPeter\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s alright. What happened?\u201d</p><p>The billionaire stands with the doctor\u2019s help and rubs the back of his head. \u201cOne of my gauntlets short-circuited.\u201d</p><p>Happy approaches them with a smirk. \u201cThe kid just woke up and he\u2019s talking a mile a minute. I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s fine. I\u2019m going back upstairs to finish my nap.\u201d</p><p>Tony rolls his eyes as Happy leaves the lab and both parents walk over to Peter to find him patting DUM-E.</p><p>\u201cGood job putting out the fire buddy. Now Dad won\u2019t have to donate you to a community college.\u201d The robot trills at the praise.</p><p>\u201cNow FRIDAY is risking reprogramming.\u201d Tony says irritably.</p><p>\u201cI tried to warn you Boss but you didn\u2019t listen.\u201d Could AI be annoyed? FRIDAY definitely sounded annoyed.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like something you would do.\u201d Stephen drawls and Tony throws his arms up.</p><p>\u201cTraitors! I\u2019m scrapping FRIDAY and breaking up with you!\u201d</p><p>Peter looks up at Tony\u2019s declaration and watches the couple in alarm, but Stephen simply smiles and the teen relaxes and turns his attention back to DUM-E. The poor kid really feared that his family was going to fall apart over something trivial and it hurt Stephen. It really showed how much Peter loved them.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t have anyone to kiss your boo-boos then.\u201d</p><p>Tony stares at Stephen until he barks out a laugh that turns into something hysterical. \u201cThat\u2019s true. Brucie isn\u2019t the type.\u201d He finally wheezes out.</p><p>Stephen then decided to take it a step further. \u201cBesides, if we break up, I\u2019m taking Peter.\u201d</p><p>The boy himself pouts. \u201cDon\u2019t drag me into your marital problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, first of all kid, we have to be married to have marital problems. Second, Stephanie, he was my kid first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys might as well get married. You already act like an old married couple.\u201d Peter grumbles and the older two glance at each other.</p><p>\u201c\u2026and <i>there\u2019s</i> the headache I get from dealing with you two.\u201d Stephen says and rubs his temples.</p><p>_____________________</p><p>+1</p><p>Stephen groggily opens his eyes when a cool hand finds itself on his forehead and he <i>purrs</i> when he finds Tony leaning over him. Something he would completely deny later because he wasn\u2019t even aware he could even make that noise.</p><p>\u201cFeeling under the weather Mama Bear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll believe that when you stop trying to hack up a lung while you\u2019re sleeping.\u201d</p><p>The sorcerer bats Tony\u2019s hand away and sits up, only for his boyfriend\u2019s hand to settle on his chest to stop him from getting up. It was weird for him to be fussed over and he also wasn\u2019t about to let a cold keep him from the research he needed to do.</p><p>\u201cIf you put one foot on the floor I am going to sic Peter on you.\u201d</p><p>That actually got Stephen\u2019s attention. Tony had gotten sick a few weeks back and when Peter got wind of it, he hovered. The teen took it upon himself to make sure that the engineer took some medicine, fed him, and even checked in on him to make sure he was resting. Stephen found it hilarious and let the boy help take care of Tony as long as he didn\u2019t disturb him.</p><p>To be on the receiving end of that though? That was a scary thought. He was the doctor in the family. He was supposed to worry about them, no matter how many headaches that might cause, not the other way around.</p><p>So he laid back down. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. The only acceptable reason for you to get out of bed is for the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too Mama Bear. Now let us take care of you.\u201d Tony kisses his forehead. \u201cI\u2019ll send Peter in with some water and pills.\u201d</p><p>Stephen glares up at him. \u201cYou\u2019re going to let him hover anyway?\u201d</p><p>Tony frowns. \u201cHe already knows you\u2019re sick. He promised not to hover.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026fine.\u201d</p><p>After Tony left the bedroom, Stephen expected Peter to stumble in a couple minutes later.</p><p>He never did.</p><p>Tony was the one to bring him whatever he needed, and the doctor immediately knew something was wrong. It took him a few minutes to think about what happened, but then he finally remembered Peter\u2019s enhanced hearing. The boy probably heard his parents\u2019 earlier conversation and assumed Stephen didn\u2019t want to be bothered by him and decided to stay away and respect his wishes.</p><p>Just the thought squeezed the sorcerer\u2019s heart painfully.</p><p>Precious, wonderful Peter ignored his own insecurities so Mom could rest without disruption.</p><p>Tony\u2019s cellphone ringing pulls Stephen out of his own head and he watches as the older man looks at the screen. He grimaces in irritation before pocketing the phone and places a glass of water on the nightstand by Stephen.</p><p>\u201cPepper needs me for something SI related.\u201d</p><p>Stephen waves him away. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ll have FRIDAY annoy Bruce if I need something.\u201d</p><p>Tony opens his mouth as if to say something but seems to think better of it and closes his mouth again. Stephen relaxes against his pillow when the billionaire leaves and allows himself to doze off until a thud and a soft curse wakes him later in the evening. Blue eyes blink open at the disturbance and he immediately makes eye contact with doe-like brown eyes wide with horror.</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to wake you! I\u2019m only in here because Dad asked me to check on you. Y-You\u2019re obviously fine so I\u2019ll\u2026go. Yeah.\u201d Peter turns to leave and Stephen quickly reaches out and grabs his sleeve.</p><p>\u201cCome here Spiderling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear I wasn\u2019t hovering!\u201d</p><p>Stephen smiles softly and pulls the younger onto the bed next to him. \u201cYou can watch tv if you want\u2026just keep me company.\u201d</p><p>The horror slowly eases away as the sorcerer pulls him into a hug, and Peter quietly turns on the tv with low volume. If this wasn\u2019t enough to show his son he wasn\u2019t bothered, he didn\u2019t know what was. He really did need the company though. After living in the chaos of the tower for months, the quiet was unnerving.</p><p>Stephen found that he really didn\u2019t mind.</p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h1>The Doctor Is In</h1><p><b>(5 times Stephen took care of Tony and Peter and 1 time they took care of him)</b></p><p>Stephen fled from the Tower the moment heavy metal music echoed through the surrounding floors of the lab. It wasn&rsquo;t that he hated the music, it was the fact that he knew exactly what it meant.</p><p>Tony and Peter were blowing things up.</p><p>He could meditate through a majority of things that went on in the Tower. Like if Clint and Sam took over their living room to play video games, Peter crawling all over the ceiling, Tony&nbsp; cursing at something he&rsquo;s tinkering with on the coffee table&hellip;or Clint crawling through the air vents. Their floor was constantly taken over by the other Avengers, and he had grown used to it, but explosions from the lab was another thing entirely. It was random and had different levels of noise that startled Stephen&rsquo;s astral form back into his body and left him momentarily confused and disoriented. Not a fun feeling.</p><p>Stephen sighs when Wong drops a stack of books on the table in front of him and he opens a single eye. &ldquo;Do you mind?&rdquo;</p><p>Wong ignores him as he sits down. &ldquo;AC/DC?&rdquo;</p><p>The sorcerer supreme stretches out in his chair. &ldquo;Metallica.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t blasting music hurt Peter&rsquo;s ears?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s used to it. He&rsquo;s usually the one controlling the volume anyway.&rdquo; Stephen slumps in his chair.</p><p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s motherhood treating you?&rdquo; Wong grins.</p><p>Strange groans. &ldquo;Not you too. How did you know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony calls you Mama Bear almost all the time. It was obvious.&rdquo; Wong flips through one of the books. &ldquo;&hellip;and I heard Peter call you Mom.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That boy will be the death of me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought I saw some more grey hair.&rdquo;</p><p>He wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised. Both Peter and Tony had very little consideration for self-preservation to the point that&hellip;well&hellip;they were blowing things up in the lab. He could confidently bet the Eye of Agamotto that he would go home to at least one of them in need of first aid. Bruce only helped them in emergencies for how often they got themselves into trouble. He was tired of fishing glass out of broken skin because of a stupid idea.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tempted to cover them in bubble wrap so I can have a minute of peace without having to worry about what trouble they&rsquo;re getting into.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your domesticity is nauseating.&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen smirks. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just jealous.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hardly.&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen&rsquo;s phone starts ringing and he looks at the screen, sighs, and answers.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes Spiderling?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Holy crap! Where are you?! Dad got knocked out by the fire extinguisher&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen coughs to hide his laugh. He was definitely going to watch today&rsquo;s recording of the lab to see how that happened. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be there shortly.&rdquo;</p><p>He hangs up before Peter can utter another word and glances at Wong.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the damage this time?&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen grins. &ldquo;Technical knockout by a fire extinguisher.&rdquo;</p><p>Wong laughs.</p><p>_______________________</p><p>&ldquo;Peter I swear&ndash;&rdquo; A Lego smacks painlessly against Stephen&rsquo;s forehead. &ldquo;Did you just throw a Lego at me?!&rdquo;</p><p>The teen flattens himself against the ceiling. &ldquo;That was my venom! I&rsquo;m a spider!&rdquo;</p><p><i>The Vishanti are testing me.</i></p><p>Peter had just recently gotten all of his wisdom teeth pulled and was on very strong pain killers. Something Stephen prayed he would never have to give the boy again because he was a <i>menace</i>. Peter refused to stay in bed and had taken to the ceiling instead, leaving Stephen no choice but to follow him and try to coax him down. He hoped to whatever entity that was listening that the boy wouldn&rsquo;t fall and hurt himself.</p><p>The first thing he tried was Levi but Peter stubbornly clung to the ceiling so he had to wave the cloak off from that attempt. Bribing him with ice cream was a dead end as well.</p><p>&ldquo;Spiderling, you don&rsquo;t spit venom.&rdquo; Then another idea came to mind and Stephen didn&rsquo;t know why he didn&rsquo;t think if it before. &ldquo;How does a movie night with cuddles sound?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter looks at the sorcerer and seems to think over his offer. &ldquo;&lsquo;Kay.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter was a sucker for physical contact no matter how high he was.</p><p>Stephen sighs with relief when the teen moves down from the ceiling and immediately clings to the older man&rsquo;s front like a baby. The sorcerer wraps his arms around Peter to hold him steady, and makes his way back to the boy&rsquo;s bedroom where he gently deposits his burden. He murmurs to the boy to stay while he leaves to change into something more comfortable, and thankfully returns to Peter&rsquo;s room a couple minutes later to find the boy curled up under his blankets.</p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Dad?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;At an Accords meeting. He&rsquo;ll be back by dinner.&rdquo; Strange slips into bed next to Peter and the teen wastes no time in curling up against him. &ldquo;What do you want to watch Spider-Baby?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Disney movie.&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen has Karen (Tony connected Peter&rsquo;s AI to his bedroom) start a Disney movie, and gently strokes brown curls. It didn&rsquo;t take long for Peter to pass out between the ministrations and snuggling. One would think the boy was touch starved.</p><p>_____________ </p><p>The tower was calm. Peter was at school and Tony was at a meeting, so Stephen felt he could relax. He really should have known better. As soon as he stretched out on the couch with an actual book not related to the mystic artes, Tony strode out of the elevator with blood streaming down his temple. The sorcerer sighs when his boyfriend flops onto the couch when he sits up, and he retrieves the first aid kit and some ice through a couple of small portals.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d ask how your meeting went but that would be pointless.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony hisses when Stephen applies some antiseptic. &ldquo;The meeting was fine. The private meeting Ross wanted&hellip;not so much.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just say the word and I can have him free-falling for a couple of hours.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That would be counter productive since I&rsquo;m trying to keep you and Peter out of the Accords. You&rsquo;re both special cases.&rdquo; </p><p>The doctor finishes by applying a butterfly bandage and then hands Tony the ice. The engineer did have legitimate reasons for keeping Stephen and Peter away. Stephen was the Sorcerer Supreme, and had a responsibility to protect the world from magical attacks. Peter was simply underage.</p><p>&ldquo;Head feeling better?&rdquo; Stephen asks softly.</p><p>Tony nods and grimaces as he places the ice pack on his head. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll live.&rdquo;</p><p>Scott slips into the living room and sits in an armchair sipping at a juice pouch. &ldquo;Hey Strange, your Mama Bear is showing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That better not be Peter&rsquo;s Capri Sun.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Case and point.&rdquo; He grins and loudly sucks every last drop.</p><p>&ldquo;Quit raiding my fridge Lang.&rdquo; Tony snarks.</p><p>&ldquo;Quit buying all the good stuff.&rdquo; Scott kicks his legs up onto the coffee table and turns on the t.v.</p><p>Stephen simply laid out on the couch again with his legs across Tony&rsquo;s lap and read while the other two watched reruns of Friends. He would take the quiet while he could. It was a rare occurrence.</p><p>____________________</p><p>&ldquo;Doctor Strange, you have an incoming call from Peter.&rdquo; Victor calls from his bracelet.</p><p>Stephen sighs and puts his tea down to pull his phone out of his pocket.

If this wasn&rsquo;t enough to show his son he wasn&rsquo;t bothered, he didn&rsquo;t know what was. He really did need the company though. After living in the chaos of the tower for months, the quiet was unnerving.</p><p>Stephen found that he really didn&rsquo;t mind.</p></p>",

These moments hit you hard and I know that I personally cried. Now, the question that I can\u2019t seem to let go of is, what now? I\u2019m not asking for the MCU universe, but for the fans? Although it is fictional, people have dedicated 11 years of their lives admiring and creating a sense of relation to these characters. When you create bonds with people it\u2019s hard to accept and move past those feelings when they die, so what happens when a character dies? I know that for myself, I get emotionally invested in things fairly easily. I\u2019m not crazy obsessive, but I still have strong feelings and connections to things like fictional characters because they feel real to me. It\u2019s almost like celebrities, people care about them although they\u2019ve never met them because they learn so much about them over time. This is at least how my brain processes relationships and I can\u2019t imagine I\u2019m the only one. This leads to my point, what happens now for the fans that feel like they\u2019ve really lost someone they care about? I ask this for myself as well. I know what it feels like to grieve and avoidance is a tactic that I use to avoid facing the grieving process and I know that I\u2019ve been doing this towards anything with the MCU. It\u2019s not that I immediately start crying or anything, but I feel uncomfortable, anxious, and upset and so I try to avoid things that make me feel this way and it ends up stressing me out. Again, I can\u2019t imagine I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s been going through this and it makes me sad to think that there\u2019s probably a lot of people going through the grieving process alone because they might feel like people will think they\u2019re being stupid. People need to talk about this, people need to know they\u2019re not alone. If you feel this way, know that you aren\u2019t alone, and you should find someone to talk to. You\u2019re not ridiculous, you are grieving over someone you cared about and that\u2019s okay. The new spider movie seems to be a guide through the grief, but sometimes that\u2019s not enough. Talk to someone if you are feeling bad! People care about what you care about I promise. Stay strong you guys, you\u2019ll make it through this.           </p>",
