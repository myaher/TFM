I don&rsquo;t people very well, I&rsquo;m well aware it&rsquo;s been a long time since I&rsquo;ve had a lot of practice, but, I have to be careful. If can&rsquo;t be careful enough, I have to go.<br/>BEAU: &hellip;Do you have to go or do you want to go?

It is very much beside the point! Because if I care for any of you at all - and that man in the Northern end of this Empire knows where any one of you are, he knows he can get to me. If he finds us, you will all just be - be - thrown into the fire with me.<br/>BEAU: Caleb, unfortunately you don&rsquo;t get to choose who cares for you.

I am saying that if we are going to be stay together, we have to be careful. Careful.<br/>BEAU: What do you want? 'Cause we can&rsquo;t find anything out if we don&rsquo;t talk to people, if we&rsquo;re not careful. I don&rsquo;t like not knowing either, Caleb. It&rsquo;s why I thought I would talk to people.<br/>CALEB: Just - just persons like that one in that tower.<br/>BEAU: I thought you&rsquo;d be excited. I thought I did a damn good job in there, I thought me and Caduceus both did. I was talkin&rsquo; to Nott and we thought for damn sure that you would be so stoked about this god damn fuckin&rsquo; tower. <br/>CALEB: [pauses] You know, in the abstract, I am.

But the problem with friends is that you have to care about them. [Caleb walks off]<br>BEAU: [yelling] Wow, wow! Fucking cool, Caleb!</p>",
                "content": "<p><i>[transcript for Beau and Caleb&rsquo;s conversation in episode 48. Sorry if this is already floating around, but this conversation had a lot to unpack for both of them and wanted it/hadn&rsquo;t seen one yet.]</i></p><p>CALEB: May I borrow you for a word?<br />BEAU: What, me? Uh, yeah, sup.<br />CALEB: I was very brusque back in Nicodranas with you, um &hellip; [sighs] I&rsquo;m sorry, I felt very, uh &hellip; exposed, with that man. [pauses]<br />BEAU: What, what - what was that?<br />CALEB: I was just collecting my thoughts.<br />BEAU: Okay.<br />CALEB: With a man like Yussa, if he wanted to find us - maybe not me, but the rest of you - he will. And I do not know his allegiances or his motives or anything, and neither did you, none of us did. And - there are people who would flay me like a cat if they could get their hands on me, so &hellip;<br />BEAU: Did he say something to you? About your past when you were in there with him?<br />CALEB: No. No, but he was hard to read.<br />BEAU: You - you think he saw into you?<br />CALEB: I don&rsquo;t know, Beauregard. But I do not like to not know, and I like travelling with you people and I don&rsquo;t want to take unnessicary risks, so - I&rsquo;m not telling you what to do, I could not tell you what to do, but if &hellip; [sighs] For me to stay with you all, I can&rsquo;t keep poking my head up like a mole from the hole in the ground &lsquo;cause someone&rsquo;s going to cave my skull in if I do it in the wrong place and if you are all with me - you will die with me. </p><p>That man in Rexxentrum he would spread my guts onto the stone floor if he could get his hands on me now, if he knew where I was, so I factor that into all my thinking. Everywhere we go, everywhere I have been for five years I have been looking over my shoulder, so, it&rsquo;s not really fair to all of you because we are linked like this now. He - he is arguably the most powerful man in the Empire.<br />BEAU: The man in Rexxentrum or Yussa?<br />CALEB: Ikithon.</p><p>I just wanted you to understand me better. As much as I am able to have friends, I like you, alright? I don&rsquo;t people very well, I&rsquo;m well aware it&rsquo;s been a long time since I&rsquo;ve had a lot of practice, but, I have to be careful. If can&rsquo;t be careful enough, I have to go.<br />BEAU: &hellip;Do you have to go or do you want to go? 'Cause what I&rsquo;m hearing from you Caleb is that you don&rsquo;t understand that you *have* friends, who are here, willing to defend you and kick some ass just like we did for Fjord.<br />CALEB: That is beside the point!<br />BEAU: Is it though?<br />CALEB: Yes! It is very much beside the point! Because if I care for any of you at all - and that man in the Northern end of this Empire knows where any one of you are, he knows he can get to me. If he finds us, you will all just be - be - thrown into the fire with me.<br />BEAU: Caleb, unfortunately you don&rsquo;t get to choose who cares for you. That&rsquo;s not a choice you get to make.<br />CALEB: [fidgets nervously] <br />BEAU: You can either accept this or -<br />CALEB: That is - we&rsquo;re talking around each, that is not the point that I am arguing. I am saying that if we are going to be stay together, we have to be careful. Careful.<br />BEAU: What do you want? 'Cause we can&rsquo;t find anything out if we don&rsquo;t talk to people, if we&rsquo;re not careful. I don&rsquo;t like not knowing either, Caleb. It&rsquo;s why I thought I would talk to people.<br />CALEB: Just - just persons like that one in that tower.<br />BEAU: I thought you&rsquo;d be excited. I thought I did a damn good job in there, I thought me and Caduceus both did. I was talkin&rsquo; to Nott and we thought for damn sure that you would be so stoked about this god damn fuckin&rsquo; tower. <br />CALEB: [pauses] You know, in the abstract, I am. But the problem with friends is that you have to care about them. [Caleb walks off]<br />BEAU: [yelling] Wow, wow! Fucking cool, Caleb!</p>",
