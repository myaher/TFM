Y/BF/N raised an eyebrow with amusement. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;You&rsquo;re lying. You&rsquo;ve got plans with someone.&ldquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I pulled a face. &quot;What? No, I don&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She jumped off her bed and onto mine, squealing excitedly. &ldquo;Oh my god, you do! You&rsquo;ve got a date!&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I rolled my eyes, feeling my hands grow clammy with nerves. &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Y/BF/N eyeballed me suspiciously. &ldquo;Mm-hm. If you say so. You know I&rsquo;ll find out eventually, right?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I shrugged. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She chuckled and went back to her own bed, leaving me to my book. I sighed with relief, glad that the conversation was over. It&rsquo;s not that I was ashamed of my date with Kate, I just wasn&rsquo;t ready to share it with anyone yet. What if it didn&rsquo;t work out? What if it went nowhere? </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Oh, screw it. I wasn&rsquo;t worried because of that. I was a little scared that if people found out, they would treat me differently. Make fun of me because of my interest in girls. Or, well, <i>girl</i>. It was stupid. But it didn&rsquo;t change how I felt about it all. I&rsquo;d tell Y/BF/N eventually, I promised myself. I would. Just not now. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That mindset didn&rsquo;t last long however, as the next afternoon, a few days before Kate and I&rsquo;s date, I headed to my bedroom to grab some textbooks when Y/BF/N saw me and jumped up with excitement. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;It&rsquo;s Kate!&ldquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I furrowed my eyebrows. &quot;Hi to you, too&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Your date!&ldquo; she clarified, grinning at me. &quot;You&rsquo;ve got a date with Kate this weekend! <i>That&rsquo;s </i>why you won&rsquo;t go with me this weekend.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I felt my heart drop to my stomach as I watched her with shock. &ldquo;Erm, how do you- how do you know that, Y/BF/N?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She sensed my nervousness as she moved forward and rested a hand on my forearm. She gave me a reassuring smile and said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, Y/N. I&rsquo;m really happy for you. It makes sense, I mean, Kate has been flirting with you nonstop for, like, <i>ever</i>.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Thanks, but how did you find out?&ldquo; I repeated, still a little confused. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Everybody kinda knows,&rdquo; she admitted, smiling apologetically. &ldquo;I overheard some girls talking about it. It&rsquo;s kind of everywhere.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My face grew warm as I nodded. &ldquo;Oh&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Y/N, it&rsquo;s totally okay,&ldquo; she said, reassuring me once again. &quot;This is awesome. I hope you have a great time. I&rsquo;ll help you get ready. And you better tell me everything, yeah?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I nodded, though I was only half listening. I was still curious as to how everybody had found out about Kate and I&rsquo;s date. I hadn&rsquo;t told anyone and the only other person who knew was Kate herself. Wait a minute&hellip;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I&rsquo;m gonna be right back,&ldquo; I said to Y/BF/N, backing up to the door. &quot;I gotta do something.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Y/BF/N nodded, though wore a confused expression. &ldquo;Okay, see ya&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I left our room and headed to the other end of the long, winding corridor where Kate&rsquo;s room was. I knocked on it, waiting as patiently as I could as I tried to think about what I was going to say. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After what felt like forever, the door finally opened revealing Lucasta, another of Kate&rsquo;s friends and roommates. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Hey&hellip; Y/N,&ldquo; she said upon seeing me. A friendly smile was on her lips as she said, &quot;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I cleared my throat and offered her a small smile. &ldquo;Hey, erm, sorry to bother you, but is Kate here? I was hoping I could speak with her.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lucasta glanced over her shoulder and I heard mumbling between her and some others. I think it was Fern and Kate&hellip;? Eventually, she stepped to the side and Kate came to the door, grinning at me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Hey, what&rsquo;s up?&ldquo; she asked, eyes looking me up and down with a cheeky smile. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I hated that I grew flustered under her stare. &quot;Hey, can we talk for a minute? In private?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She nodded, stepping out of her room and closing her door behind her. We went by the window of the empty hall, her facing me with a slightly puzzled expression. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;What&rsquo;s wrong?&ldquo; she asked, watching me with mild concern. &quot;You okay?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I sighed. &ldquo;Did you tell everyone about our date this weekend?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She quirked an eyebrow, a confused smile on her lips. &ldquo;No, why?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I pressed my lips together as I avoided her eyes. &ldquo;Y/BF/N said she overheard some girls talking about it earlier and apparently everybody knows about it.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kate seemed in thought as she leaned against the wall. &ldquo;Hmm&hellip; I told the girls and I guess Victoria was there, too. Fern says she has a bit of a big mouth, so maybe she told everyone.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I breathed out, hoping my nerves would settle. Kate stood up straight again, giving me a forced smile. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Why are you bothered? Were you ashamed of it?&ldquo; she asked and it was the first time I&rsquo;d ever heard hurt in her voice before. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I felt guilty as I saw offence flash across her expression. I shook my head instantly, taking her hands in mine and squeezing them gently. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;No, Kate, of course not,&rdquo; I said, meeting her warm brown eyes. &ldquo;I just didn&rsquo;t know&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t know how it would go down when people found out. I didn&rsquo;t want anyone to make fun of us or anything.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I knew my face must have been flaming hot with embarrassment as I looked down at our hands, unable to look her in the eyes any longer. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She let go of one of my hands and used it to raise my head, forcing me to meet her eyes. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Who would make fun of us? Of you?&ldquo; she asked, watching me worriedly. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I shook my head. &quot;It doesn&rsquo;t matter. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;No,&ldquo; she said, refusing to drop it. She kept eye contact as she said, &quot;I won&rsquo;t let anybody make fun of you for anything, Y/N. If they do, they have to answer to me.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I smiled awkwardly.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Do you still want to go out this weekend?&ldquo; she asked, eyes searching mine questioningly. &quot;If you&rsquo;re uncomfortable, you don&rsquo;t have to.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;No, I do.&ldquo; I nodded eagerly, giving her a reassuring smile. &quot;I want to go, Kate.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She smiled with relief. &ldquo;Good. Because I&rsquo;m really excited.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I felt my heart fluttering at how caring she was for my feelings. &ldquo;Me, too,&rdquo; I said. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She grinned and her eyes flickered to my lips before she moved forward and stole a quick kiss before pulling away, keeping ahold of my hands. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Good. If anyone gives you shit, you let me know,&ldquo; she insisted, eyes peering down at me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My lips tingled from her kiss as I nodded. &quot;Okay.&rdquo; </p><p>***</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The date came around faster than I thought and Y/BF/N had followed through with her word and helped me get ready. Kate said we were going into town to some Chinese restaurant, one of the few places that wasn&rsquo;t dead around there. So, I settled with a simple yet comfortable outfit, though I&rsquo;d be lying if I said I didn&rsquo;t make any effort to impress just a little bit. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;You should get going now, she&rsquo;ll be waiting for you,&ldquo; Y/BF/N said as she finished curling my hair. &quot;You look beautiful, Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I smiled nervously and pulled her in for a hug. &ldquo;Thanks for helping me. I really appreciate it.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Any time,&ldquo; she said, before ushering me to the door. &quot;Now go and have some fun!&rdquo; She spun me around in the doorway, to face her. A serious expression was on her face as she added, &ldquo;Remember. Be safe, don&rsquo;t do anything I wouldn&rsquo;t do, and tell me all about it when you get back.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I laughed. &ldquo;I promise.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With a last shove from her, I headed downstairs to the main entrance, spotting Kate waiting by the door, her attention taken by some framed photos on the wall. She looked amazing and <i>way </i>too cool to be going out with me. She was wearing a leather jacket on top of a crop top, some jeans and boots. Her blonde hair was left hanging over her shoulders and my mouth suddenly went dry. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Hey,&ldquo; I said once I was down the stairs, finding words. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Hey,&rdquo; she began, eyes still on the photos, &ldquo;is it just me or are those frames not equally put- woah.&rdquo; She had finally torn her eyes away from the photos and was staring at me with wide eyes. \u00a0&quot;You look amazing.&ldquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I felt my heart beating a little bit faster as she stared me up and down, before grinning at me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Thanks,&rdquo; I said, meeting her eyes. &ldquo;So do you.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She moved forward and touched my hair. &ldquo;You suit your hair down. You should leave it out more often.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Now I definitely ran out words, unable to think up a coherent sentence as she dropped her hand back by her side and met my eyes with her glowing hazel ones. She was chuckling now, knowing she&rsquo;d, once again, rendered me speechless. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Come on, we should go before we miss the bus,&ldquo; she said with amusement, holding out her hand. \u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I rolled my eyes playfully and placed my hand in hers, allowing her to lead me out the doors. </p><p>***</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I&rsquo;m paying, Y/N,&rdquo; Kate said adamantly. &ldquo;I asked you out after all.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;At least go splitsies,&ldquo; I insisted, though Kate was the most stubborn person I&rsquo;d ever met, so I knew she wouldn&rsquo;t budge. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Next time,&rdquo; she said with a humoured smile, pulling out her purse. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;You seem pretty confident that there&rsquo;ll be a next time,&ldquo; I teased, raising my eyebrow. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She waved over a waitress before smirking at me. &quot;I&rsquo;m pretty sure there will be.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I pursed my lips, trying to hold in my smile, but it was impossible. She&rsquo;d had me smiling all through dinner. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After Kate paid, we both left the restaurant and decided to go through town. It was dark out now, but the sky looked beautiful full of stars, and this small, uneventful town didn&rsquo;t look so bad at the moment. Kate looped her arm through mine and pulled me close as we walked. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;If my memory is correct, I believe there&rsquo;s an ice cream truck right around this corner,&ldquo; she said adorably, and when we rounded the corner, she fist pumped. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;You&rsquo;re such a nerd,&rdquo; I mumbled, watching her with adoration. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Do you want ice cream or not?&ldquo; she asked rhetorically, and all it took was a nod from myself before she cheered and dragged me to the truck. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was a mother and her younger daughter getting served and Kate was impatiently jumping up and down beside me. I laughed and tried to hold her still, but she gave me a knowing look, as if ice cream was a valid excuse to become impatient. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Okay, they&rsquo;re done being served, now go on, you big child,&rdquo; I said once the mother and kid left. Kate grinned and moved forward, dragging me along with her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Hi, ladies, what can I get you?&ldquo; the ice cream man asked. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Two scoops of bubblegum ice cream, please,&rdquo; Kate requested with an innocent smile. She glanced at me. &ldquo;What would you like?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Mint chocolate chip.&ldquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;And another cone with two scoops of mint chocolate chip, please,&rdquo; she added, looking back to the ice cream man. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;That&rsquo;s eight dollars,&ldquo; he said as he was scooping the ice cream. &quot;You ladies want any sauce or sprinkles?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I shook my head, as did Kate, and she reached into her pocket to grab her purse. I didn&rsquo;t even bother trying to pay because I knew what she&rsquo;d say, so I watched as she pulled a bunch of stuff from her jacket pocket, trying to pull out her purse. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She ended up pulling out her purse, a hair tie, a quarter, a sweet wrapper and a cigarette packet. I took the napkin-wrapped ice cream cones from the man and sighed quietly at the sight of her cigarette packet, forgetting that was a habit of hers. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;What?&ldquo; she asked, giving me an amused glance. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She paid the man and thanked him before the two of us walked away. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I shrugged, handing her her ice cream cone. Trying to change the subject, I licked all around the edge of my ice cream before saying, &quot;You know, the first thing you should do when getting an ice cream is lick it all around so it doesn&rsquo;t drip.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kate laughed and took the napkin from her cone. &ldquo;The first thing you do is also get it all over your face,&rdquo; she teased, before wiping my mouth with her napkin. &ldquo;And stop trying to change the subject. Why d'you sigh back there?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As we continued walking side by side, I looked ahead and said, &ldquo;Honestly, it&rsquo;s just a little off-putting that you smoke.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her smile widened with amusement as she stared at me. &ldquo;And why&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I gave her a knowing look. &ldquo;Come on, Kate. You know why. For one, the smell? If you keep smoking, it will linger on you and you&rsquo;ll start to smell of tobacco. Then there&rsquo;s the taste, which I can only imagine is horrible. And the fact that it&rsquo;s killing you&hellip; need I go on?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She was still watching me as I finished, now smiling cheekily. &ldquo;Why would you taste it if I&rsquo;m the one smoking it? Unless&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I was confused, but the longer she stared, I soon realised she was being dirty-minded and had to roll my eyes, only making her laugh. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Seriously, Kate,&ldquo; I said, before licking my ice cream. &quot;Have you ever considered quitting?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She shrugged and licked her own ice cream, staring ahead as we walked. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I could quit if I wanted to, but I like it. It calms me when I&rsquo;m stressed.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;What if I ask nicely?&ldquo; I said, cocking my head to the side and staring at her. \u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She smiled and looked at me, raising her eyebrows. &quot;Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Kate,&ldquo; I said in the same way she did, not backing down. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her eyes peered into mine confidently, but I didn&rsquo;t falter. I cared about her enough to not want her to hurt her body like she was doing. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Fine,&rdquo; she gave in, sighing as she un-looped her free arm from mine and reached into her pocket, grabbing the cigarette packet and lighter. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I smiled proudly, licking my ice cream and watching her go to the nearest bin and toss both of them in it. She approached me with a sarcastic smile. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Happy now?&ldquo; she asked, linking her arm with mine again. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I chuckled. &quot;Let&rsquo;s see how long that&rsquo;ll last.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;As long as I want it to,&ldquo; she retorted knowingly. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I grinned. &quot;Well, I&rsquo;m proud of you anyway.&rdquo; I leaned forward and kissed her gently, before pulling away. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Will I keep getting more kisses if I don&rsquo;t smoke anymore?&ldquo; she asked, an obnoxiously beautiful smile on her lips as she looked down at me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I rolled my eyes with a smile. &quot;Maybe.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Totally worth it,&ldquo; she mumbled, and I laughed before leaning into her arm. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I licked my ice cream and a comfortable silence fell between us as we walked through town. There were still some locals walking about and we had about an hour before we had to be back at school, so there was no pressure or reason to leave just yet. It was lovely, relaxing, an amazing evening. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;This flavour is so good,&rdquo; I said, breaking the silence when I got an idea. &ldquo;That might be because I&rsquo;ve not had ice cream in a while, though.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Mmm,&ldquo; Kate agreed as she ate her own. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Want a taste?&rdquo; I asked, holding out my cone for her to lick. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Sure,&ldquo; she said, leaning in to lick it. She nodded, giving me a look of agreement. &quot;It&rsquo;s pretty good.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I smiled mischievously and pushed the cone into her face a little, making her gasp as her mouth and nose got covered in ice cream. I laughed when she glared at me, resisting the urge to laugh. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;That was very much worth it,&ldquo; I said, licking my ice cream innocently. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She pursed her lips and nodded before looking at me teasingly. &quot;You want to taste it?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I gave her a knowing look. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my ice cream, idiot. And if you think I&rsquo;m gonna fall for the same trick then you must be ve-&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She silenced me by pressing her ice cream-covered lips to my numb ones. She rested her free hand on the nape of my neck and held me close, before slipping her tongue between my lips and taking me by surprise. I barely got chance to react before she pulled away, licking her lips and meeting my eyes with her troublesome ones.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;How did that taste?&ldquo; she asked with a smirk, eyes staring me down intimidatingly. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I felt my cheeks heating up as I opened my mouth to speak, but I didn&rsquo;t know what to say, which made her smile widen. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I hate you,&rdquo; I finally said, making her laugh as she used her napkin to wipe her face then mine. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;No, you don&rsquo;t,&ldquo; she said knowingly, and I hated that she was right.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After we finished our ice cream, we caught the bus back to school so we wouldn&rsquo;t miss our curfew, and Kate walked me to my room sweetly. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I had a really lovely time tonight, Kate, thank you,&rdquo; I said quietly, unsure if Y/BF/N was asleep in our room. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Me, too,&ldquo; she said, smiling adorably at me. &quot;Thanks for letting me take you out.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I felt my stomach doing somersaults as she looked at me, stepping forward. She pressed a gentle kiss to my lips before smiling at me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Goodnight, Y/N,&ldquo; she said, squeezing my hand before stepping back. &quot;I&rsquo;ll see you tomorrow.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I waved goodbye to her, not trusting myself to say anything that wouldn&rsquo;t embarrass me in this very moment. I turned around and walked into my room, grinning to myself like a silly teen with a crush, but that&rsquo;s exactly what this was. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I noticed Y/BF/N asleep in her bed, a lamp on beside her. I chuckled to myself and pulled her blanket over her, planning to tell her everything she wanted to know tomorrow at breakfast. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For now, I had to try and figure out a way to fall asleep without Kate stuck in my head. But judging by the permanent smile stuck on my lips, I knew that would be impossible.</p>",

Y/BF/N raised an eyebrow with amusement. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You\u2019re lying. You\u2019ve got plans with someone.\u201c </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I pulled a face. \"What? No, I don\u2019t\u2026\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She jumped off her bed and onto mine, squealing excitedly. \u201cOh my god, you do! You\u2019ve got a date!\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I rolled my eyes, feeling my hands grow clammy with nerves. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Y/BF/N eyeballed me suspiciously. \u201cMm-hm. If you say so. You know I\u2019ll find out eventually, right?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I shrugged. \u201cDon\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She chuckled and went back to her own bed, leaving me to my book. I sighed with relief, glad that the conversation was over. It\u2019s not that I was ashamed of my date with Kate, I just wasn\u2019t ready to share it with anyone yet. What if it didn\u2019t work out? What if it went nowhere? </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Oh, screw it. I wasn\u2019t worried because of that. I was a little scared that if people found out, they would treat me differently. Make fun of me because of my interest in girls. Or, well, <i>girl</i>. It was stupid. But it didn\u2019t change how I felt about it all. I\u2019d tell Y/BF/N eventually, I promised myself. I would. Just not now. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That mindset didn\u2019t last long however, as the next afternoon, a few days before Kate and I\u2019s date, I headed to my bedroom to grab some textbooks when Y/BF/N saw me and jumped up with excitement. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It\u2019s Kate!\u201c </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I furrowed my eyebrows. \"Hi to you, too\u2026\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Your date!\u201c she clarified, grinning at me. \"You\u2019ve got a date with Kate this weekend! <i>That\u2019s </i>why you won\u2019t go with me this weekend.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I felt my heart drop to my stomach as I watched her with shock. \u201cErm, how do you- how do you know that, Y/BF/N?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She sensed my nervousness as she moved forward and rested a hand on my forearm. She gave me a reassuring smile and said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Y/N. I\u2019m really happy for you. It makes sense, I mean, Kate has been flirting with you nonstop for, like, <i>ever</i>.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thanks, but how did you find out?\u201c I repeated, still a little confused. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Everybody kinda knows,\u201d she admitted, smiling apologetically. \u201cI overheard some girls talking about it. It\u2019s kind of everywhere.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My face grew warm as I nodded. \u201cOh\u2026\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Y/N, it\u2019s totally okay,\u201c she said, reassuring me once again. \"This is awesome. I hope you have a great time. I\u2019ll help you get ready. And you better tell me everything, yeah?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I nodded, though I was only half listening. I was still curious as to how everybody had found out about Kate and I\u2019s date. I hadn\u2019t told anyone and the only other person who knew was Kate herself. Wait a minute\u2026</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I\u2019m gonna be right back,\u201c I said to Y/BF/N, backing up to the door. \"I gotta do something.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Y/BF/N nodded, though wore a confused expression. \u201cOkay, see ya\u2026\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I left our room and headed to the other end of the long, winding corridor where Kate\u2019s room was. I knocked on it, waiting as patiently as I could as I tried to think about what I was going to say. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After what felt like forever, the door finally opened revealing Lucasta, another of Kate\u2019s friends and roommates. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey\u2026 Y/N,\u201c she said upon seeing me. A friendly smile was on her lips as she said, \"What\u2019s up?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I cleared my throat and offered her a small smile. \u201cHey, erm, sorry to bother you, but is Kate here? I was hoping I could speak with her.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lucasta glanced over her shoulder and I heard mumbling between her and some others. I think it was Fern and Kate\u2026? Eventually, she stepped to the side and Kate came to the door, grinning at me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, what\u2019s up?\u201c she asked, eyes looking me up and down with a cheeky smile. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I hated that I grew flustered under her stare. \"Hey, can we talk for a minute? In private?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She nodded, stepping out of her room and closing her door behind her. We went by the window of the empty hall, her facing me with a slightly puzzled expression. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What\u2019s wrong?\u201c she asked, watching me with mild concern. \"You okay?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I sighed. \u201cDid you tell everyone about our date this weekend?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She quirked an eyebrow, a confused smile on her lips. \u201cNo, why?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I pressed my lips together as I avoided her eyes. \u201cY/BF/N said she overheard some girls talking about it earlier and apparently everybody knows about it.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kate seemed in thought as she leaned against the wall. \u201cHmm\u2026 I told the girls and I guess Victoria was there, too. Fern says she has a bit of a big mouth, so maybe she told everyone.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I breathed out, hoping my nerves would settle. Kate stood up straight again, giving me a forced smile. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Why are you bothered? Were you ashamed of it?\u201c she asked and it was the first time I\u2019d ever heard hurt in her voice before. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I felt guilty as I saw offence flash across her expression. I shook my head instantly, taking her hands in mine and squeezing them gently. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, Kate, of course not,\u201d I said, meeting her warm brown eyes. \u201cI just didn\u2019t know\u2026 I didn\u2019t know how it would go down when people found out. I didn\u2019t want anyone to make fun of us or anything.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I knew my face must have been flaming hot with embarrassment as I looked down at our hands, unable to look her in the eyes any longer. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She let go of one of my hands and used it to raise my head, forcing me to meet her eyes. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Who would make fun of us? Of you?\u201c she asked, watching me worriedly. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I shook my head. \"It doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No,\u201c she said, refusing to drop it. She kept eye contact as she said, \"I won\u2019t let anybody make fun of you for anything, Y/N. If they do, they have to answer to me.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I smiled awkwardly.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Do you still want to go out this weekend?\u201c she asked, eyes searching mine questioningly. \"If you\u2019re uncomfortable, you don\u2019t have to.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, I do.\u201c I nodded eagerly, giving her a reassuring smile. \"I want to go, Kate.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She smiled with relief. \u201cGood. Because I\u2019m really excited.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I felt my heart fluttering at how caring she was for my feelings. \u201cMe, too,\u201d I said. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She grinned and her eyes flickered to my lips before she moved forward and stole a quick kiss before pulling away, keeping ahold of my hands. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good. If anyone gives you shit, you let me know,\u201c she insisted, eyes peering down at me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My lips tingled from her kiss as I nodded. \"Okay.\u201d </p><p>***</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The date came around faster than I thought and Y/BF/N had followed through with her word and helped me get ready. Kate said we were going into town to some Chinese restaurant, one of the few places that wasn\u2019t dead around there. So, I settled with a simple yet comfortable outfit, though I\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t make any effort to impress just a little bit. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You should get going now, she\u2019ll be waiting for you,\u201c Y/BF/N said as she finished curling my hair. \"You look beautiful, Y/N.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I smiled nervously and pulled her in for a hug. \u201cThanks for helping me. I really appreciate it.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Any time,\u201c she said, before ushering me to the door. \"Now go and have some fun!\u201d She spun me around in the doorway, to face her. A serious expression was on her face as she added, \u201cRemember. Be safe, don\u2019t do anything I wouldn\u2019t do, and tell me all about it when you get back.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I laughed. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With a last shove from her, I headed downstairs to the main entrance, spotting Kate waiting by the door, her attention taken by some framed photos on the wall. She looked amazing and <i>way </i>too cool to be going out with me. She was wearing a leather jacket on top of a crop top, some jeans and boots. Her blonde hair was left hanging over her shoulders and my mouth suddenly went dry. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey,\u201c I said once I was down the stairs, finding words. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey,\u201d she began, eyes still on the photos, \u201cis it just me or are those frames not equally put- woah.\u201d She had finally torn her eyes away from the photos and was staring at me with wide eyes. \u00a0\"You look amazing.\u201c</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I felt my heart beating a little bit faster as she stared me up and down, before grinning at me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thanks,\u201d I said, meeting her eyes. \u201cSo do you.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She moved forward and touched my hair. \u201cYou suit your hair down. You should leave it out more often.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Now I definitely ran out words, unable to think up a coherent sentence as she dropped her hand back by her side and met my eyes with her glowing hazel ones. She was chuckling now, knowing she\u2019d, once again, rendered me speechless. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Come on, we should go before we miss the bus,\u201c she said with amusement, holding out her hand. \u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I rolled my eyes playfully and placed my hand in hers, allowing her to lead me out the doors. </p><p>***</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I\u2019m paying, Y/N,\u201d Kate said adamantly. \u201cI asked you out after all.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"At least go splitsies,\u201c I insisted, though Kate was the most stubborn person I\u2019d ever met, so I knew she wouldn\u2019t budge. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Next time,\u201d she said with a humoured smile, pulling out her purse. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You seem pretty confident that there\u2019ll be a next time,\u201c I teased, raising my eyebrow. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She waved over a waitress before smirking at me. \"I\u2019m pretty sure there will be.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I pursed my lips, trying to hold in my smile, but it was impossible. She\u2019d had me smiling all through dinner. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After Kate paid, we both left the restaurant and decided to go through town. It was dark out now, but the sky looked beautiful full of stars, and this small, uneventful town didn\u2019t look so bad at the moment. Kate looped her arm through mine and pulled me close as we walked. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"If my memory is correct, I believe there\u2019s an ice cream truck right around this corner,\u201c she said adorably, and when we rounded the corner, she fist pumped. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You\u2019re such a nerd,\u201d I mumbled, watching her with adoration. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Do you want ice cream or not?\u201c she asked rhetorically, and all it took was a nod from myself before she cheered and dragged me to the truck. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was a mother and her younger daughter getting served and Kate was impatiently jumping up and down beside me. I laughed and tried to hold her still, but she gave me a knowing look, as if ice cream was a valid excuse to become impatient. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay, they\u2019re done being served, now go on, you big child,\u201d I said once the mother and kid left. Kate grinned and moved forward, dragging me along with her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hi, ladies, what can I get you?\u201c the ice cream man asked. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Two scoops of bubblegum ice cream, please,\u201d Kate requested with an innocent smile. She glanced at me. \u201cWhat would you like?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mint chocolate chip.\u201c</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And another cone with two scoops of mint chocolate chip, please,\u201d she added, looking back to the ice cream man. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That\u2019s eight dollars,\u201c he said as he was scooping the ice cream. \"You ladies want any sauce or sprinkles?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I shook my head, as did Kate, and she reached into her pocket to grab her purse. I didn\u2019t even bother trying to pay because I knew what she\u2019d say, so I watched as she pulled a bunch of stuff from her jacket pocket, trying to pull out her purse. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She ended up pulling out her purse, a hair tie, a quarter, a sweet wrapper and a cigarette packet. I took the napkin-wrapped ice cream cones from the man and sighed quietly at the sight of her cigarette packet, forgetting that was a habit of hers. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What?\u201c she asked, giving me an amused glance. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She paid the man and thanked him before the two of us walked away. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I shrugged, handing her her ice cream cone. Trying to change the subject, I licked all around the edge of my ice cream before saying, \"You know, the first thing you should do when getting an ice cream is lick it all around so it doesn\u2019t drip.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kate laughed and took the napkin from her cone. \u201cThe first thing you do is also get it all over your face,\u201d she teased, before wiping my mouth with her napkin. \u201cAnd stop trying to change the subject. Why d'you sigh back there?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As we continued walking side by side, I looked ahead and said, \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s just a little off-putting that you smoke.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her smile widened with amusement as she stared at me. \u201cAnd why\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I gave her a knowing look. \u201cCome on, Kate. You know why. For one, the smell? If you keep smoking, it will linger on you and you\u2019ll start to smell of tobacco. Then there\u2019s the taste, which I can only imagine is horrible. And the fact that it\u2019s killing you\u2026 need I go on?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She was still watching me as I finished, now smiling cheekily. \u201cWhy would you taste it if I\u2019m the one smoking it? Unless\u2026\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I was confused, but the longer she stared, I soon realised she was being dirty-minded and had to roll my eyes, only making her laugh. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Seriously, Kate,\u201c I said, before licking my ice cream. \"Have you ever considered quitting?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She shrugged and licked her own ice cream, staring ahead as we walked. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I could quit if I wanted to, but I like it. It calms me when I\u2019m stressed.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What if I ask nicely?\u201c I said, cocking my head to the side and staring at her. \u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She smiled and looked at me, raising her eyebrows. \"Y/N.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Kate,\u201c I said in the same way she did, not backing down. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her eyes peered into mine confidently, but I didn\u2019t falter. I cared about her enough to not want her to hurt her body like she was doing. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Fine,\u201d she gave in, sighing as she un-looped her free arm from mine and reached into her pocket, grabbing the cigarette packet and lighter. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I smiled proudly, licking my ice cream and watching her go to the nearest bin and toss both of them in it. She approached me with a sarcastic smile. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Happy now?\u201c she asked, linking her arm with mine again. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I chuckled. \"Let\u2019s see how long that\u2019ll last.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"As long as I want it to,\u201c she retorted knowingly. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I grinned. \"Well, I\u2019m proud of you anyway.\u201d I leaned forward and kissed her gently, before pulling away. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Will I keep getting more kisses if I don\u2019t smoke anymore?\u201c she asked, an obnoxiously beautiful smile on her lips as she looked down at me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I rolled my eyes with a smile. \"Maybe.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Totally worth it,\u201c she mumbled, and I laughed before leaning into her arm. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I licked my ice cream and a comfortable silence fell between us as we walked through town. There were still some locals walking about and we had about an hour before we had to be back at school, so there was no pressure or reason to leave just yet. It was lovely, relaxing, an amazing evening. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This flavour is so good,\u201d I said, breaking the silence when I got an idea. \u201cThat might be because I\u2019ve not had ice cream in a while, though.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mmm,\u201c Kate agreed as she ate her own. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Want a taste?\u201d I asked, holding out my cone for her to lick. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sure,\u201c she said, leaning in to lick it. She nodded, giving me a look of agreement. \"It\u2019s pretty good.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I smiled mischievously and pushed the cone into her face a little, making her gasp as her mouth and nose got covered in ice cream. I laughed when she glared at me, resisting the urge to laugh. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That was very much worth it,\u201c I said, licking my ice cream innocently. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She pursed her lips and nodded before looking at me teasingly. \"You want to taste it?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I gave her a knowing look. \u201cIt\u2019s my ice cream, idiot. And if you think I\u2019m gonna fall for the same trick then you must be ve-\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She silenced me by pressing her ice cream-covered lips to my numb ones. She rested her free hand on the nape of my neck and held me close, before slipping her tongue between my lips and taking me by surprise. I barely got chance to react before she pulled away, licking her lips and meeting my eyes with her troublesome ones.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How did that taste?\u201c she asked with a smirk, eyes staring me down intimidatingly. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I felt my cheeks heating up as I opened my mouth to speak, but I didn\u2019t know what to say, which made her smile widen. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I hate you,\u201d I finally said, making her laugh as she used her napkin to wipe her face then mine. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, you don\u2019t,\u201c she said knowingly, and I hated that she was right.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After we finished our ice cream, we caught the bus back to school so we wouldn\u2019t miss our curfew, and Kate walked me to my room sweetly. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I had a really lovely time tonight, Kate, thank you,\u201d I said quietly, unsure if Y/BF/N was asleep in our room. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Me, too,\u201c she said, smiling adorably at me. \"Thanks for letting me take you out.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I felt my stomach doing somersaults as she looked at me, stepping forward. She pressed a gentle kiss to my lips before smiling at me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Goodnight, Y/N,\u201c she said, squeezing my hand before stepping back. \"I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I waved goodbye to her, not trusting myself to say anything that wouldn\u2019t embarrass me in this very moment. I turned around and walked into my room, grinning to myself like a silly teen with a crush, but that\u2019s exactly what this was. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I noticed Y/BF/N asleep in her bed, a lamp on beside her. I chuckled to myself and pulled her blanket over her, planning to tell her everything she wanted to know tomorrow at breakfast. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For now, I had to try and figure out a way to fall asleep without Kate stuck in my head. But judging by the permanent smile stuck on my lips, I knew that would be impossible.</p>",

Y/BF/N raised an eyebrow with amusement. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You\u2019re lying. You\u2019ve got plans with someone.\u201c </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I pulled a face. \"What? No, I don\u2019t\u2026\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She jumped off her bed and onto mine, squealing excitedly. \u201cOh my god, you do! You\u2019ve got a date!\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I rolled my eyes, feeling my hands grow clammy with nerves. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Y/BF/N eyeballed me suspiciously. \u201cMm-hm. If you say so. You know I\u2019ll find out eventually, right?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I shrugged. \u201cDon\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She chuckled and went back to her own bed, leaving me to my book. I sighed with relief, glad that the conversation was over. It\u2019s not that I was ashamed of my date with Kate, I just wasn\u2019t ready to share it with anyone yet. What if it didn\u2019t work out? What if it went nowhere? </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Oh, screw it. I wasn\u2019t worried because of that. I was a little scared that if people found out, they would treat me differently. Make fun of me because of my interest in girls. Or, well, <i>girl</i>. It was stupid. But it didn\u2019t change how I felt about it all. I\u2019d tell Y/BF/N eventually, I promised myself. I would. Just not now. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That mindset didn\u2019t last long however, as the next afternoon, a few days before Kate and I\u2019s date, I headed to my bedroom to grab some textbooks when Y/BF/N saw me and jumped up with excitement. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It\u2019s Kate!\u201c </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I furrowed my eyebrows. \"Hi to you, too\u2026\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Your date!\u201c she clarified, grinning at me. \"You\u2019ve got a date with Kate this weekend! <i>That\u2019s </i>why you won\u2019t go with me this weekend.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I felt my heart drop to my stomach as I watched her with shock. \u201cErm, how do you- how do you know that, Y/BF/N?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She sensed my nervousness as she moved forward and rested a hand on my forearm. She gave me a reassuring smile and said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Y/N. I\u2019m really happy for you. It makes sense, I mean, Kate has been flirting with you nonstop for, like, <i>ever</i>.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thanks, but how did you find out?\u201c I repeated, still a little confused. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Everybody kinda knows,\u201d she admitted, smiling apologetically. \u201cI overheard some girls talking about it. It\u2019s kind of everywhere.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My face grew warm as I nodded. \u201cOh\u2026\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Y/N, it\u2019s totally okay,\u201c she said, reassuring me once again. \"This is awesome. I hope you have a great time. I\u2019ll help you get ready. And you better tell me everything, yeah?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I nodded, though I was only half listening. I was still curious as to how everybody had found out about Kate and I\u2019s date. I hadn\u2019t told anyone and the only other person who knew was Kate herself. Wait a minute\u2026</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I\u2019m gonna be right back,\u201c I said to Y/BF/N, backing up to the door. \"I gotta do something.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Y/BF/N nodded, though wore a confused expression. \u201cOkay, see ya\u2026\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I left our room and headed to the other end of the long, winding corridor where Kate\u2019s room was. I knocked on it, waiting as patiently as I could as I tried to think about what I was going to say. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After what felt like forever, the door finally opened revealing Lucasta, another of Kate\u2019s friends and roommates. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey\u2026 Y/N,\u201c she said upon seeing me. A friendly smile was on her lips as she said, \"What\u2019s up?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I cleared my throat and offered her a small smile. \u201cHey, erm, sorry to bother you, but is Kate here? I was hoping I could speak with her.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lucasta glanced over her shoulder and I heard mumbling between her and some others. I think it was Fern and Kate\u2026? Eventually, she stepped to the side and Kate came to the door, grinning at me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, what\u2019s up?\u201c she asked, eyes looking me up and down with a cheeky smile. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I hated that I grew flustered under her stare. \"Hey, can we talk for a minute? In private?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She nodded, stepping out of her room and closing her door behind her. We went by the window of the empty hall, her facing me with a slightly puzzled expression. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What\u2019s wrong?\u201c she asked, watching me with mild concern. \"You okay?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I sighed. \u201cDid you tell everyone about our date this weekend?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She quirked an eyebrow, a confused smile on her lips. \u201cNo, why?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I pressed my lips together as I avoided her eyes. \u201cY/BF/N said she overheard some girls talking about it earlier and apparently everybody knows about it.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kate seemed in thought as she leaned against the wall. \u201cHmm\u2026 I told the girls and I guess Victoria was there, too. Fern says she has a bit of a big mouth, so maybe she told everyone.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I breathed out, hoping my nerves would settle. Kate stood up straight again, giving me a forced smile. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Why are you bothered? Were you ashamed of it?\u201c she asked and it was the first time I\u2019d ever heard hurt in her voice before. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I felt guilty as I saw offence flash across her expression. I shook my head instantly, taking her hands in mine and squeezing them gently. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, Kate, of course not,\u201d I said, meeting her warm brown eyes. \u201cI just didn\u2019t know\u2026 I didn\u2019t know how it would go down when people found out. I didn\u2019t want anyone to make fun of us or anything.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I knew my face must have been flaming hot with embarrassment as I looked down at our hands, unable to look her in the eyes any longer. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She let go of one of my hands and used it to raise my head, forcing me to meet her eyes. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Who would make fun of us? Of you?\u201c she asked, watching me worriedly. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I shook my head. \"It doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No,\u201c she said, refusing to drop it. She kept eye contact as she said, \"I won\u2019t let anybody make fun of you for anything, Y/N. If they do, they have to answer to me.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I smiled awkwardly.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Do you still want to go out this weekend?\u201c she asked, eyes searching mine questioningly. \"If you\u2019re uncomfortable, you don\u2019t have to.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, I do.\u201c I nodded eagerly, giving her a reassuring smile. \"I want to go, Kate.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She smiled with relief. \u201cGood. Because I\u2019m really excited.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I felt my heart fluttering at how caring she was for my feelings. \u201cMe, too,\u201d I said. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She grinned and her eyes flickered to my lips before she moved forward and stole a quick kiss before pulling away, keeping ahold of my hands. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good. If anyone gives you shit, you let me know,\u201c she insisted, eyes peering down at me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My lips tingled from her kiss as I nodded. \"Okay.\u201d </p><p>***</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The date came around faster than I thought and Y/BF/N had followed through with her word and helped me get ready. Kate said we were going into town to some Chinese restaurant, one of the few places that wasn\u2019t dead around there. So, I settled with a simple yet comfortable outfit, though I\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t make any effort to impress just a little bit. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You should get going now, she\u2019ll be waiting for you,\u201c Y/BF/N said as she finished curling my hair. \"You look beautiful, Y/N.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I smiled nervously and pulled her in for a hug. \u201cThanks for helping me. I really appreciate it.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Any time,\u201c she said, before ushering me to the door. \"Now go and have some fun!\u201d She spun me around in the doorway, to face her. A serious expression was on her face as she added, \u201cRemember. Be safe, don\u2019t do anything I wouldn\u2019t do, and tell me all about it when you get back.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I laughed. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With a last shove from her, I headed downstairs to the main entrance, spotting Kate waiting by the door, her attention taken by some framed photos on the wall. She looked amazing and <i>way </i>too cool to be going out with me. She was wearing a leather jacket on top of a crop top, some jeans and boots. Her blonde hair was left hanging over her shoulders and my mouth suddenly went dry. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey,\u201c I said once I was down the stairs, finding words. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey,\u201d she began, eyes still on the photos, \u201cis it just me or are those frames not equally put- woah.\u201d She had finally torn her eyes away from the photos and was staring at me with wide eyes. \u00a0\"You look amazing.\u201c</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I felt my heart beating a little bit faster as she stared me up and down, before grinning at me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thanks,\u201d I said, meeting her eyes. \u201cSo do you.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She moved forward and touched my hair. \u201cYou suit your hair down. You should leave it out more often.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Now I definitely ran out words, unable to think up a coherent sentence as she dropped her hand back by her side and met my eyes with her glowing hazel ones. She was chuckling now, knowing she\u2019d, once again, rendered me speechless. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Come on, we should go before we miss the bus,\u201c she said with amusement, holding out her hand. \u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I rolled my eyes playfully and placed my hand in hers, allowing her to lead me out the doors. </p><p>***</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I\u2019m paying, Y/N,\u201d Kate said adamantly. \u201cI asked you out after all.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"At least go splitsies,\u201c I insisted, though Kate was the most stubborn person I\u2019d ever met, so I knew she wouldn\u2019t budge. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Next time,\u201d she said with a humoured smile, pulling out her purse. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You seem pretty confident that there\u2019ll be a next time,\u201c I teased, raising my eyebrow. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She waved over a waitress before smirking at me. \"I\u2019m pretty sure there will be.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I pursed my lips, trying to hold in my smile, but it was impossible. She\u2019d had me smiling all through dinner. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After Kate paid, we both left the restaurant and decided to go through town. It was dark out now, but the sky looked beautiful full of stars, and this small, uneventful town didn\u2019t look so bad at the moment. Kate looped her arm through mine and pulled me close as we walked. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"If my memory is correct, I believe there\u2019s an ice cream truck right around this corner,\u201c she said adorably, and when we rounded the corner, she fist pumped. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You\u2019re such a nerd,\u201d I mumbled, watching her with adoration. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Do you want ice cream or not?\u201c she asked rhetorically, and all it took was a nod from myself before she cheered and dragged me to the truck. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was a mother and her younger daughter getting served and Kate was impatiently jumping up and down beside me. I laughed and tried to hold her still, but she gave me a knowing look, as if ice cream was a valid excuse to become impatient. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay, they\u2019re done being served, now go on, you big child,\u201d I said once the mother and kid left. Kate grinned and moved forward, dragging me along with her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hi, ladies, what can I get you?\u201c the ice cream man asked. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Two scoops of bubblegum ice cream, please,\u201d Kate requested with an innocent smile. She glanced at me. \u201cWhat would you like?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mint chocolate chip.\u201c</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And another cone with two scoops of mint chocolate chip, please,\u201d she added, looking back to the ice cream man. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That\u2019s eight dollars,\u201c he said as he was scooping the ice cream. \"You ladies want any sauce or sprinkles?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I shook my head, as did Kate, and she reached into her pocket to grab her purse. I didn\u2019t even bother trying to pay because I knew what she\u2019d say, so I watched as she pulled a bunch of stuff from her jacket pocket, trying to pull out her purse. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She ended up pulling out her purse, a hair tie, a quarter, a sweet wrapper and a cigarette packet. I took the napkin-wrapped ice cream cones from the man and sighed quietly at the sight of her cigarette packet, forgetting that was a habit of hers. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What?\u201c she asked, giving me an amused glance. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She paid the man and thanked him before the two of us walked away. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I shrugged, handing her her ice cream cone. Trying to change the subject, I licked all around the edge of my ice cream before saying, \"You know, the first thing you should do when getting an ice cream is lick it all around so it doesn\u2019t drip.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kate laughed and took the napkin from her cone. \u201cThe first thing you do is also get it all over your face,\u201d she teased, before wiping my mouth with her napkin. \u201cAnd stop trying to change the subject. Why d'you sigh back there?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As we continued walking side by side, I looked ahead and said, \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s just a little off-putting that you smoke.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her smile widened with amusement as she stared at me. \u201cAnd why\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I gave her a knowing look. \u201cCome on, Kate. You know why. For one, the smell? If you keep smoking, it will linger on you and you\u2019ll start to smell of tobacco. Then there\u2019s the taste, which I can only imagine is horrible. And the fact that it\u2019s killing you\u2026 need I go on?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She was still watching me as I finished, now smiling cheekily. \u201cWhy would you taste it if I\u2019m the one smoking it? Unless\u2026\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I was confused, but the longer she stared, I soon realised she was being dirty-minded and had to roll my eyes, only making her laugh. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Seriously, Kate,\u201c I said, before licking my ice cream. \"Have you ever considered quitting?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She shrugged and licked her own ice cream, staring ahead as we walked. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I could quit if I wanted to, but I like it. It calms me when I\u2019m stressed.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What if I ask nicely?\u201c I said, cocking my head to the side and staring at her. \u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She smiled and looked at me, raising her eyebrows. \"Y/N.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Kate,\u201c I said in the same way she did, not backing down. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her eyes peered into mine confidently, but I didn\u2019t falter. I cared about her enough to not want her to hurt her body like she was doing. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Fine,\u201d she gave in, sighing as she un-looped her free arm from mine and reached into her pocket, grabbing the cigarette packet and lighter. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I smiled proudly, licking my ice cream and watching her go to the nearest bin and toss both of them in it. She approached me with a sarcastic smile. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Happy now?\u201c she asked, linking her arm with mine again. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I chuckled. \"Let\u2019s see how long that\u2019ll last.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"As long as I want it to,\u201c she retorted knowingly. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I grinned. \"Well, I\u2019m proud of you anyway.\u201d I leaned forward and kissed her gently, before pulling away. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Will I keep getting more kisses if I don\u2019t smoke anymore?\u201c she asked, an obnoxiously beautiful smile on her lips as she looked down at me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I rolled my eyes with a smile. \"Maybe.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Totally worth it,\u201c she mumbled, and I laughed before leaning into her arm. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I licked my ice cream and a comfortable silence fell between us as we walked through town. There were still some locals walking about and we had about an hour before we had to be back at school, so there was no pressure or reason to leave just yet. It was lovely, relaxing, an amazing evening. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This flavour is so good,\u201d I said, breaking the silence when I got an idea. \u201cThat might be because I\u2019ve not had ice cream in a while, though.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mmm,\u201c Kate agreed as she ate her own. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Want a taste?\u201d I asked, holding out my cone for her to lick. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sure,\u201c she said, leaning in to lick it. She nodded, giving me a look of agreement. \"It\u2019s pretty good.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I smiled mischievously and pushed the cone into her face a little, making her gasp as her mouth and nose got covered in ice cream. I laughed when she glared at me, resisting the urge to laugh. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That was very much worth it,\u201c I said, licking my ice cream innocently. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She pursed her lips and nodded before looking at me teasingly. \"You want to taste it?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I gave her a knowing look. \u201cIt\u2019s my ice cream, idiot. And if you think I\u2019m gonna fall for the same trick then you must be ve-\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She silenced me by pressing her ice cream-covered lips to my numb ones. She rested her free hand on the nape of my neck and held me close, before slipping her tongue between my lips and taking me by surprise. I barely got chance to react before she pulled away, licking her lips and meeting my eyes with her troublesome ones.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How did that taste?\u201c she asked with a smirk, eyes staring me down intimidatingly. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I felt my cheeks heating up as I opened my mouth to speak, but I didn\u2019t know what to say, which made her smile widen. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I hate you,\u201d I finally said, making her laugh as she used her napkin to wipe her face then mine. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, you don\u2019t,\u201c she said knowingly, and I hated that she was right.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After we finished our ice cream, we caught the bus back to school so we wouldn\u2019t miss our curfew, and Kate walked me to my room sweetly. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I had a really lovely time tonight, Kate, thank you,\u201d I said quietly, unsure if Y/BF/N was asleep in our room. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Me, too,\u201c she said, smiling adorably at me. \"Thanks for letting me take you out.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I felt my stomach doing somersaults as she looked at me, stepping forward. She pressed a gentle kiss to my lips before smiling at me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Goodnight, Y/N,\u201c she said, squeezing my hand before stepping back. \"I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I waved goodbye to her, not trusting myself to say anything that wouldn\u2019t embarrass me in this very moment. I turned around and walked into my room, grinning to myself like a silly teen with a crush, but that\u2019s exactly what this was. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I noticed Y/BF/N asleep in her bed, a lamp on beside her.

Y/BF/N raised an eyebrow with amusement. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"You&rsquo;re lying. You&rsquo;ve got plans with someone.&ldquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I pulled a face. \"What? No, I don&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She jumped off her bed and onto mine, squealing excitedly. &ldquo;Oh my god, you do! You&rsquo;ve got a date!&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I rolled my eyes, feeling my hands grow clammy with nerves. &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Y/BF/N eyeballed me suspiciously. &ldquo;Mm-hm. If you say so. You know I&rsquo;ll find out eventually, right?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I shrugged. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She chuckled and went back to her own bed, leaving me to my book. I sighed with relief, glad that the conversation was over. It&rsquo;s not that I was ashamed of my date with Kate, I just wasn&rsquo;t ready to share it with anyone yet. What if it didn&rsquo;t work out? What if it went nowhere? </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Oh, screw it. I wasn&rsquo;t worried because of that. I was a little scared that if people found out, they would treat me differently. Make fun of me because of my interest in girls. Or, well, <i>girl</i>. It was stupid. But it didn&rsquo;t change how I felt about it all. I&rsquo;d tell Y/BF/N eventually, I promised myself. I would. Just not now. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That mindset didn&rsquo;t last long however, as the next afternoon, a few days before Kate and I&rsquo;s date, I headed to my bedroom to grab some textbooks when Y/BF/N saw me and jumped up with excitement. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"It&rsquo;s Kate!&ldquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I furrowed my eyebrows. \"Hi to you, too&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Your date!&ldquo; she clarified, grinning at me. \"You&rsquo;ve got a date with Kate this weekend! <i>That&rsquo;s </i>why you won&rsquo;t go with me this weekend.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I felt my heart drop to my stomach as I watched her with shock. &ldquo;Erm, how do you- how do you know that, Y/BF/N?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She sensed my nervousness as she moved forward and rested a hand on my forearm. She gave me a reassuring smile and said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, Y/N. I&rsquo;m really happy for you. It makes sense, I mean, Kate has been flirting with you nonstop for, like, <i>ever</i>.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Thanks, but how did you find out?&ldquo; I repeated, still a little confused. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Everybody kinda knows,&rdquo; she admitted, smiling apologetically. &ldquo;I overheard some girls talking about it. It&rsquo;s kind of everywhere.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My face grew warm as I nodded. &ldquo;Oh&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Y/N, it&rsquo;s totally okay,&ldquo; she said, reassuring me once again. \"This is awesome. I hope you have a great time. I&rsquo;ll help you get ready. And you better tell me everything, yeah?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I nodded, though I was only half listening. I was still curious as to how everybody had found out about Kate and I&rsquo;s date. I hadn&rsquo;t told anyone and the only other person who knew was Kate herself. Wait a minute&hellip;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I&rsquo;m gonna be right back,&ldquo; I said to Y/BF/N, backing up to the door. \"I gotta do something.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Y/BF/N nodded, though wore a confused expression. &ldquo;Okay, see ya&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I left our room and headed to the other end of the long, winding corridor where Kate&rsquo;s room was. I knocked on it, waiting as patiently as I could as I tried to think about what I was going to say. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After what felt like forever, the door finally opened revealing Lucasta, another of Kate&rsquo;s friends and roommates. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Hey&hellip; Y/N,&ldquo; she said upon seeing me. A friendly smile was on her lips as she said, \"What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I cleared my throat and offered her a small smile. &ldquo;Hey, erm, sorry to bother you, but is Kate here? I was hoping I could speak with her.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lucasta glanced over her shoulder and I heard mumbling between her and some others. I think it was Fern and Kate&hellip;? Eventually, she stepped to the side and Kate came to the door, grinning at me. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Hey, what&rsquo;s up?&ldquo; she asked, eyes looking me up and down with a cheeky smile. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I hated that I grew flustered under her stare. \"Hey, can we talk for a minute? In private?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She nodded, stepping out of her room and closing her door behind her. We went by the window of the empty hall, her facing me with a slightly puzzled expression. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"What&rsquo;s wrong?&ldquo; she asked, watching me with mild concern. \"You okay?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I sighed. &ldquo;Did you tell everyone about our date this weekend?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She quirked an eyebrow, a confused smile on her lips. &ldquo;No, why?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I pressed my lips together as I avoided her eyes. &ldquo;Y/BF/N said she overheard some girls talking about it earlier and apparently everybody knows about it.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kate seemed in thought as she leaned against the wall. &ldquo;Hmm&hellip; I told the girls and I guess Victoria was there, too. Fern says she has a bit of a big mouth, so maybe she told everyone.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I breathed out, hoping my nerves would settle. Kate stood up straight again, giving me a forced smile. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Why are you bothered? Were you ashamed of it?&ldquo; she asked and it was the first time I&rsquo;d ever heard hurt in her voice before. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I felt guilty as I saw offence flash across her expression. I shook my head instantly, taking her hands in mine and squeezing them gently. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"No, Kate, of course not,&rdquo; I said, meeting her warm brown eyes. &ldquo;I just didn&rsquo;t know&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t know how it would go down when people found out. I didn&rsquo;t want anyone to make fun of us or anything.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I knew my face must have been flaming hot with embarrassment as I looked down at our hands, unable to look her in the eyes any longer. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She let go of one of my hands and used it to raise my head, forcing me to meet her eyes. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Who would make fun of us? Of you?&ldquo; she asked, watching me worriedly. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I shook my head. \"It doesn&rsquo;t matter. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"No,&ldquo; she said, refusing to drop it. She kept eye contact as she said, \"I won&rsquo;t let anybody make fun of you for anything, Y/N. If they do, they have to answer to me.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I smiled awkwardly.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Do you still want to go out this weekend?&ldquo; she asked, eyes searching mine questioningly. \"If you&rsquo;re uncomfortable, you don&rsquo;t have to.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"No, I do.&ldquo; I nodded eagerly, giving her a reassuring smile. \"I want to go, Kate.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She smiled with relief. &ldquo;Good. Because I&rsquo;m really excited.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I felt my heart fluttering at how caring she was for my feelings. &ldquo;Me, too,&rdquo; I said. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She grinned and her eyes flickered to my lips before she moved forward and stole a quick kiss before pulling away, keeping ahold of my hands. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Good. If anyone gives you shit, you let me know,&ldquo; she insisted, eyes peering down at me. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My lips tingled from her kiss as I nodded. \"Okay.&rdquo; </p><p>***</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The date came around faster than I thought and Y/BF/N had followed through with her word and helped me get ready. Kate said we were going into town to some Chinese restaurant, one of the few places that wasn&rsquo;t dead around there. So, I settled with a simple yet comfortable outfit, though I&rsquo;d be lying if I said I didn&rsquo;t make any effort to impress just a little bit. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"You should get going now, she&rsquo;ll be waiting for you,&ldquo; Y/BF/N said as she finished curling my hair. \"You look beautiful, Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I smiled nervously and pulled her in for a hug. &ldquo;Thanks for helping me. I really appreciate it.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Any time,&ldquo; she said, before ushering me to the door. \"Now go and have some fun!&rdquo; She spun me around in the doorway, to face her. A serious expression was on her face as she added, &ldquo;Remember. Be safe, don&rsquo;t do anything I wouldn&rsquo;t do, and tell me all about it when you get back.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I laughed. &ldquo;I promise.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With a last shove from her, I headed downstairs to the main entrance, spotting Kate waiting by the door, her attention taken by some framed photos on the wall. She looked amazing and <i>way </i>too cool to be going out with me. She was wearing a leather jacket on top of a crop top, some jeans and boots. Her blonde hair was left hanging over her shoulders and my mouth suddenly went dry. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Hey,&ldquo; I said once I was down the stairs, finding words. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Hey,&rdquo; she began, eyes still on the photos, &ldquo;is it just me or are those frames not equally put- woah.&rdquo; She had finally torn her eyes away from the photos and was staring at me with wide eyes. &nbsp;\"You look amazing.&ldquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I felt my heart beating a little bit faster as she stared me up and down, before grinning at me. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Thanks,&rdquo; I said, meeting her eyes. &ldquo;So do you.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She moved forward and touched my hair. &ldquo;You suit your hair down. You should leave it out more often.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now I definitely ran out words, unable to think up a coherent sentence as she dropped her hand back by her side and met my eyes with her glowing hazel ones. She was chuckling now, knowing she&rsquo;d, once again, rendered me speechless. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Come on, we should go before we miss the bus,&ldquo; she said with amusement, holding out her hand. &nbsp;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I rolled my eyes playfully and placed my hand in hers, allowing her to lead me out the doors. </p><p>***</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I&rsquo;m paying, Y/N,&rdquo; Kate said adamantly. &ldquo;I asked you out after all.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"At least go splitsies,&ldquo; I insisted, though Kate was the most stubborn person I&rsquo;d ever met, so I knew she wouldn&rsquo;t budge. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Next time,&rdquo; she said with a humoured smile, pulling out her purse. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"You seem pretty confident that there&rsquo;ll be a next time,&ldquo; I teased, raising my eyebrow. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She waved over a waitress before smirking at me. \"I&rsquo;m pretty sure there will be.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I pursed my lips, trying to hold in my smile, but it was impossible. She&rsquo;d had me smiling all through dinner. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After Kate paid, we both left the restaurant and decided to go through town. It was dark out now, but the sky looked beautiful full of stars, and this small, uneventful town didn&rsquo;t look so bad at the moment. Kate looped her arm through mine and pulled me close as we walked. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"If my memory is correct, I believe there&rsquo;s an ice cream truck right around this corner,&ldquo; she said adorably, and when we rounded the corner, she fist pumped. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"You&rsquo;re such a nerd,&rdquo; I mumbled, watching her with adoration. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Do you want ice cream or not?&ldquo; she asked rhetorically, and all it took was a nod from myself before she cheered and dragged me to the truck. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was a mother and her younger daughter getting served and Kate was impatiently jumping up and down beside me. I laughed and tried to hold her still, but she gave me a knowing look, as if ice cream was a valid excuse to become impatient. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Okay, they&rsquo;re done being served, now go on, you big child,&rdquo; I said once the mother and kid left. Kate grinned and moved forward, dragging me along with her. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Hi, ladies, what can I get you?&ldquo; the ice cream man asked. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Two scoops of bubblegum ice cream, please,&rdquo; Kate requested with an innocent smile. She glanced at me. &ldquo;What would you like?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Mint chocolate chip.&ldquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"And another cone with two scoops of mint chocolate chip, please,&rdquo; she added, looking back to the ice cream man. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"That&rsquo;s eight dollars,&ldquo; he said as he was scooping the ice cream. \"You ladies want any sauce or sprinkles?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I shook my head, as did Kate, and she reached into her pocket to grab her purse. I didn&rsquo;t even bother trying to pay because I knew what she&rsquo;d say, so I watched as she pulled a bunch of stuff from her jacket pocket, trying to pull out her purse. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She ended up pulling out her purse, a hair tie, a quarter, a sweet wrapper and a cigarette packet. I took the napkin-wrapped ice cream cones from the man and sighed quietly at the sight of her cigarette packet, forgetting that was a habit of hers. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"What?&ldquo; she asked, giving me an amused glance. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She paid the man and thanked him before the two of us walked away. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I shrugged, handing her her ice cream cone. Trying to change the subject, I licked all around the edge of my ice cream before saying, \"You know, the first thing you should do when getting an ice cream is lick it all around so it doesn&rsquo;t drip.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kate laughed and took the napkin from her cone. &ldquo;The first thing you do is also get it all over your face,&rdquo; she teased, before wiping my mouth with her napkin. &ldquo;And stop trying to change the subject. Why d'you sigh back there?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As we continued walking side by side, I looked ahead and said, &ldquo;Honestly, it&rsquo;s just a little off-putting that you smoke.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her smile widened with amusement as she stared at me. &ldquo;And why&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I gave her a knowing look. &ldquo;Come on, Kate. You know why. For one, the smell? If you keep smoking, it will linger on you and you&rsquo;ll start to smell of tobacco. Then there&rsquo;s the taste, which I can only imagine is horrible. And the fact that it&rsquo;s killing you&hellip; need I go on?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was still watching me as I finished, now smiling cheekily. &ldquo;Why would you taste it if I&rsquo;m the one smoking it? Unless&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was confused, but the longer she stared, I soon realised she was being dirty-minded and had to roll my eyes, only making her laugh. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Seriously, Kate,&ldquo; I said, before licking my ice cream. \"Have you ever considered quitting?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She shrugged and licked her own ice cream, staring ahead as we walked. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I could quit if I wanted to, but I like it. It calms me when I&rsquo;m stressed.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"What if I ask nicely?&ldquo; I said, cocking my head to the side and staring at her. &nbsp;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She smiled and looked at me, raising her eyebrows. \"Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Kate,&ldquo; I said in the same way she did, not backing down. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her eyes peered into mine confidently, but I didn&rsquo;t falter. I cared about her enough to not want her to hurt her body like she was doing. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Fine,&rdquo; she gave in, sighing as she un-looped her free arm from mine and reached into her pocket, grabbing the cigarette packet and lighter. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I smiled proudly, licking my ice cream and watching her go to the nearest bin and toss both of them in it. She approached me with a sarcastic smile. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Happy now?&ldquo; she asked, linking her arm with mine again. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I chuckled. \"Let&rsquo;s see how long that&rsquo;ll last.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"As long as I want it to,&ldquo; she retorted knowingly. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I grinned. \"Well, I&rsquo;m proud of you anyway.&rdquo; I leaned forward and kissed her gently, before pulling away. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Will I keep getting more kisses if I don&rsquo;t smoke anymore?&ldquo; she asked, an obnoxiously beautiful smile on her lips as she looked down at me. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I rolled my eyes with a smile. \"Maybe.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Totally worth it,&ldquo; she mumbled, and I laughed before leaning into her arm. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I licked my ice cream and a comfortable silence fell between us as we walked through town. There were still some locals walking about and we had about an hour before we had to be back at school, so there was no pressure or reason to leave just yet. It was lovely, relaxing, an amazing evening. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"This flavour is so good,&rdquo; I said, breaking the silence when I got an idea. &ldquo;That might be because I&rsquo;ve not had ice cream in a while, though.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Mmm,&ldquo; Kate agreed as she ate her own. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Want a taste?&rdquo; I asked, holding out my cone for her to lick. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Sure,&ldquo; she said, leaning in to lick it. She nodded, giving me a look of agreement. \"It&rsquo;s pretty good.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I smiled mischievously and pushed the cone into her face a little, making her gasp as her mouth and nose got covered in ice cream. I laughed when she glared at me, resisting the urge to laugh. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"That was very much worth it,&ldquo; I said, licking my ice cream innocently. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She pursed her lips and nodded before looking at me teasingly. \"You want to taste it?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I gave her a knowing look. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my ice cream, idiot. And if you think I&rsquo;m gonna fall for the same trick then you must be ve-&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She silenced me by pressing her ice cream-covered lips to my numb ones. She rested her free hand on the nape of my neck and held me close, before slipping her tongue between my lips and taking me by surprise. I barely got chance to react before she pulled away, licking her lips and meeting my eyes with her troublesome ones.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"How did that taste?&ldquo; she asked with a smirk, eyes staring me down intimidatingly. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I felt my cheeks heating up as I opened my mouth to speak, but I didn&rsquo;t know what to say, which made her smile widen. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I hate you,&rdquo; I finally said, making her laugh as she used her napkin to wipe her face then mine. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"No, you don&rsquo;t,&ldquo; she said knowingly, and I hated that she was right.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After we finished our ice cream, we caught the bus back to school so we wouldn&rsquo;t miss our curfew, and Kate walked me to my room sweetly. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I had a really lovely time tonight, Kate, thank you,&rdquo; I said quietly, unsure if Y/BF/N was asleep in our room. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Me, too,&ldquo; she said, smiling adorably at me. \"Thanks for letting me take you out.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I felt my stomach doing somersaults as she looked at me, stepping forward. She pressed a gentle kiss to my lips before smiling at me. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Goodnight, Y/N,&ldquo; she said, squeezing my hand before stepping back. \"I&rsquo;ll see you tomorrow.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I waved goodbye to her, not trusting myself to say anything that wouldn&rsquo;t embarrass me in this very moment. I turned around and walked into my room, grinning to myself like a silly teen with a crush, but that&rsquo;s exactly what this was. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I noticed Y/BF/N asleep in her bed, a lamp on beside her.
