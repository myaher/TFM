        "body": "<h2>A Marriage of Convenience {Chapter Four}</h2><p><i>The more I write about Beau&rsquo;s parents the more I can&rsquo;t wait for them to get what&rsquo;s coming. </i></p><p>Georgina Lionett was checking her teeth in a mirror when Caleb walked into the Grand Hall. She was wearing the nicest dress he\u2019d seen so far like she was dressing for a special occasion. Caleb felt underdressed and this was the best suit he owned. He cleared his throat and she jumped, spinning around. \u201cAh, Mr. Widogast! Please, take a seat, my husband will be down here in a few moments. \u201c She scurried over to her own chair and just stood beside it, not moving to seat herself.</p><p>\u201cYou look lovely this morning, Madam,\u201d he said awkwardly taking a seat. </p><p>She blushed and fixed a loose strand of hair. \u201cThank you, sir. My husband doesn\u2019t come to eat with us often, everything needs to be perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is Beauregard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been told that she is not allowed to join us unless she comes properly dressed. She told me that she didn\u2019t have any dresses and sure enough, there was nothing suitable in her closet. I don\u2019t know what she did with them, I suspect ritual burning.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>He looked back at Jester, who was determined to actually follow him around all day and she was biting her lip to suppress a grin. \u2018You know?\u2019 he mouthed at her silently.</p><p>She grinned and nodded. \u2018I took them to town for her.\u2019</p><p>\u2018To burn?\u2019</p><p>Then she either said \u2018To donate\u2019 or \u2018To prostate\u2019. He figured it was probably the first one based on the context of the conversation.</p><p>Georgina seemed to suddenly realize that Jester was there and frowned. \u201cAre you feeling ill, Mr. Widogast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, no! No, I\u2019m perfectly fine. Jester kindly offered to show me around after I got lost and she found me wandering the halls.\u201d Georgina opened her mouth to speak but Caleb didn\u2019t want her to push on this topic. He cleared his throat. \u201cI heard you were attacked this morning?\u201d</p><p>The woman gasped dramatically. \u201cOh, it was terrifying. Somehow a goblin found its way to my room. It was crazed, coming right for me. I\u2019m still a bit shaken. And the worst part is that it hasn\u2019t been found yet. It could still be in this house somewhere, can you imagine?\u201d She shuddered. \u201cIt probably has rabies, the beast.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, this was perhaps a bad subject to change to. Caleb gripped his fork tightly in his fist. The food hadn\u2019t been brought out yet, but if he didn\u2019t hold something he wasn\u2019t sure what his hand would be doing right now. He took a deep breath and turned back to look at Jester. She got the message and scurried over. \u201cIs that any chance you had a dress Beauregard could borrow? I can\u2019t be alone with her mother for much longer.\u201d</p><p>Jester frowned. \u201cI could probably find one she could wear, but I think finding one she would wear is entirely a different story probably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a skort?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA skirt with shorts under it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah! I have the perfect thing! Oh, she\u2019s gonna love it!\u201d</p><p>Caleb highly doubted that but he let Jester leave the dining room. The room fell into silence and Caleb started fidgeting with his fork, tapping it lightly against the table. \u201cSo, Mr. Widogast,\u201d Georgina started. \u201cTell me about yourself. We haven\u2019t gotten much chance to speak one on one. How are you and my daughter getting along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwimmingly, Madam,\u201d he said. \u201cThis morning she organized a quick scavenger hunt for me that was\u2026 so fun.\u201d</p><p>The woman raised a perfectly manicured eyebrow. \u201cReally? That doesn\u2019t sound like my daughter. You must bring out the best in her.\u201d She seemed like she was about to continue but the main doors to the hall opened and the Caleb could have sworn that the temperature in the room dropped ten degrees. Georgina, still standing, turned and smiled widely at the man. \u201cEston! Dear, this is the man I told you about. Caleb Widogast, meet my husband, Sir Eston Theodore Lionett.\u201d</p><p>Caleb moved to stand as Eston got close and when he shook his hand Eston squeezed. It was hard to tell if the squeeze was meant as a threat or just an honest ignorance of his own strength. \u201cCaleb. Good to meet you. I\u2019ve heard wonderful things about you from Professor Ikethon.\u201d</p><p>Caleb cleared his throat, subtly shaking out his fingers when Eston dropped his hand and continued passed him towards the head of the table. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve heard wonderful things about you from your wife.\u201d And seen the horrible things you\u2019ve done to your daughter, but he didn\u2019t say that part out loud. He took his seat again as Georgina finally took her own.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Beauregard?\u201d Eston asked, waving at the servants to start bringing out the food.</p><p>Caleb spoke up quickly before Georgina could start complaining. \u201cShe couldn&rsquo;t decide on a dress. She\u2019ll be down shortly.\u201d</p><p>Eston seemed satisfied with the answer and dropped the subject as a plate stacked high with food was set in front of him. \u201cGood. Good, I want to hear all about this whirlwind romance between the two of you.\u201d</p><p>Caleb choked on his words and leaned into his elbow to cough. \u201cWh-Whirlwind romance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Georgina said she\u2019s scheduled the wedding for a month from now, that\u2019s a bit soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I just thought that these two love birds would like to be married as soon as possible,\u201d Georgina said without a hint of irony. \u201cDoes that sound good for you and your family Caleb?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, my family is dead.\u201d He mentally kicked himself when they both froze and turned to stare at him in unison.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s so sad,\u201d Georgina said. \u201cSo, will you not be needing a table at the reception? Because if not I\u2019m going to need to replan my table orientation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Caleb said, clearing his throat. \u201cNo, I will not be needing a table. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>She turned back to her meal and continued eating but Eston was still watching him. \u201cDo you mind if I ask how they died, son?\u201d</p><p>Caleb decided to put the \u2018son\u2019 on the back burner of concerns for right now and focus on the most pressing one. He could freak about about the rest of this interaction after it was over. \u201cFire. Arson, while I was at the Academy. We\u2019re not sure who did it.\u201d That was the official story at least.</p><p>Suddenly, the door behind him was thrown open and he turned around, hopeful. Could it be? Was he saved? He never thought that he\u2019d be happy to see Beau marching into a room like she was marching into a battle but right now he needed her. The more time he spent with the people who raised her, the more he understood her issues. She wasn\u2019t wearing a dress exactly, but it was elegant and covered her midriff so hopefully Georgina wouldn\u2019t mind too much. It was a silver jumpsuit, the legs long enough to drape around her feet which were certainly not in high heels and wide enough that if she were to stand up straight with her legs together it would look like a dress, not that there was any chance of that happening. It was cinched at the waist, sleeveless, and low cut, the point of the collar starting just below her sternum and coming up loose around her shoulders to drape elegantly down her back. Her hair was pulled over one shoulder and braided intricately with beads and ribbons. She was wearing a band around her chest and she wasn\u2019t wearing shoes, so he was pretty sure that this person was actually Beau and not a very well done fake.</p><p>\u201cBeauregard,\u201d Georgina said, dropping her fork so that it clanged against her plate. \u201cWhere did you get that?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged and moved around the table to her chair. \u201cJust something I had in the back of my closet. Something wrong, Mother?\u201d</p><p>Georgina shook her head. \u201cNo, it\u2019s acceptable. Have a seat.\u201d</p><p>Beau did so and coughed into her fist, shifting uncomfortably. \u201cYou alright?\u201d Caleb asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cThis fancy fabric chafes,\u201d she muttered. </p><p>\u201cWhere did you actually get that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJester. It\u2019s her mom\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>That just gave him more questions than it answered but there would be time for that later. \u201cBeauregard, you look very handsome tonight,\u201d he said, loud enough for her parents to hear.</p><p>Her nose scrunched. \u201cEw, don\u2019t say it like that.\u201d Georgina cleared her throat pointedly and glared at her, causing Beau to roll her eyes. \u201cYou look nice too. Your tie doesn\u2019t match the drapes though, you should work on that.\u201d</p><p>Eston spoke up before she could say anything else. \u201cWe were just discussing the wedding, actually.\u201d</p><p>Beau shoved a spoonful of breakfast potatoes in her mouth. \u201cWhat wedding?\u201d she asked through food.</p><p>\u201cYour wedding, dear,\u201d Georgina siad. She was scowling at her daughter\u2019s manners but must have decided to pick her battles more carefully. This was no the hill she wanted to die on.</p><p>\u201cSweet, who am I marrying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be obtuse,\u201d Eston sneered. He looked frighteningly like his daughter when he did that.</p><p>She shrugged and grinned like she had no care in the world. \u201cJust being myself, Father. Maybe an obtuse person shouldn\u2019t be getting married to someone she met two days ago?\u201d</p><p>Her parents started tag teaming. \u201cThis behavior is going to scare Mr. Widogast away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want him to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to be alone for the rest of your life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to be a disappointment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to be a laughingstock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to be a failure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Beau said suddenly. \u201cYes, I want all of those things. I want to be a lonely, happy failure.\u201d</p><p>Georgina waved her hand dismissively. \u201cBeing happy is vastly overrated, darling.\u201d</p><p>Beau scratched at the back of her neck and shifted awkwardly in her jumpsuit but didn\u2019t say anything more for now. Aftera few silent minutes, Eston spoke up. \u201cCaleb, what was it that you were saying before Beauregard interrupted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout my dead parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould we have known them? I don\u2019t believe Widogast is a name I\u2019m familiar with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, no. No, we were poor. The Academy gave me a chance to better myself and I believe I have done quite well since then.\u201d He hoped his answer didn\u2019t sound as stilted and rehearsed as it felt. Beau was giving him a weird look so maybe she didn\u2019t believe him but Eston and Georgina seemed none the wiser. \u201cI suspect that the wealthy people of this empire will be hearing the name Widogast quite frequently as the years go on.\u201d</p><p>Eston chuckled. \u201cYes, I like your spirit. We need more go-getters like you. My daughter could learn a thing or two from you.\u201d Beau scowled down at her eggs but didn\u2019t say anything. Caleb let out a breath of relief and tried to meet Beau\u2019s eyes across the table but she was purposefully ignoring him by taking a large drink from her cup. \u201cSo, how many children will you two be having?\u201d</p><p>Beau spit her water across the table and Caleb cringed when he felt droplets hit his face. Beau swiped the back of her hand across her mouth. \u201cNone! What the fuck, what kind of question is that?\u201d</p><p>Eston got to his feet in a fluid motion and slammed his hands open palmed on the table. \u201cYou will not speak to me that way. And I wasn\u2019t talking to you, anyway. Don\u2019t speak unless spoken to, Beauregard. Someone clean up that mess.\u201d As a servant ran over to start wiping up the table, Eston turned back to Caleb. \u201cIgnore her. How many children will you be having?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhhhhhhhhhh\u2026\u201d Caleb wiped his face off with his sleeve. &ldquo;I believe that is a question for your daughter.\u201d</p><p>Beau snorted in surprised amusement and gave him a bewildered look but didn\u2019t respond. Eston frowned. \u201cWell, I am perhaps beginning to understand what my daughter sees in you. You have a bit of a rebellious streak too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that, Sir, I just believe that Beauregard is in charge of that particular decision.\u201d</p><p>Eston leaned back in his chair and smirked. \u201cYou\u2019re teasing me. That was a good one.\u201d</p><p>Caleb opened his mouth to contradict him but paused when he felt Beau tapping his knee with her foot to get his attention. He looked over at her and she shook her head. \u201cHe won\u2019t understand. I think he\u2019s purposely misunderstanding.\u201d</p><p>Caleb sighed. \u201cThree, Sir. We\u2019ll be having three children.\u201d</p><p>Eston nodded. \u201cThree. Good number.

Unfortunately he passed away when they were six. He was the eldest, he would have been the heir had things been different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Eston Senior muttered. \u201cShame, that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we not talk about EJ at the table please,\u201d Beau interrupted. \u201cMy dead brother is not exactly the best conversation to have over food, thanks.\u201d</p><p>Before Eston could start up another lecture, Caleb changed the subject. \u201cYes, actually, Sir Lionett. Why don\u2019t you tell me about your work?\u201d</p><p>The older man\u2019s face brightened. \u201cI\u2019m a winemaker. Well, I own the winemaking company, I haven\u2019t actually made any wine by my hand since long before I was married. My family growing up was not very well off, we were fine, but I don\u2019t think my parents ever dreamed their son would rise this high. I\u2019ll be sure to get you a good year to go with dinner tonight. It will be the most superb wine you\u2019ve ever tasted.

I can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>Eston started getting into more details of the business but Caleb mostly tuned him out, choosing instead to look at Beau as she started jotting numbers down on a piece of paper that was half hidden under her plate.

He figured it was probably the first one based on the context of the conversation.</p><p>Georgina seemed to suddenly realize that Jester was there and frowned. \u201cAre you feeling ill, Mr. Widogast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, no! No, I\u2019m perfectly fine. Jester kindly offered to show me around after I got lost and she found me wandering the halls.\u201d Georgina opened her mouth to speak but Caleb didn\u2019t want her to push on this topic. He cleared his throat. \u201cI heard you were attacked this morning?\u201d</p><p>The woman gasped dramatically. \u201cOh, it was terrifying. Somehow a goblin found its way to my room. It was crazed, coming right for me. I\u2019m still a bit shaken. And the worst part is that it hasn\u2019t been found yet. It could still be in this house somewhere, can you imagine?\u201d She shuddered. \u201cIt probably has rabies, the beast.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, this was perhaps a bad subject to change to. Caleb gripped his fork tightly in his fist. The food hadn\u2019t been brought out yet, but if he didn\u2019t hold something he wasn\u2019t sure what his hand would be doing right now. He took a deep breath and turned back to look at Jester. She got the message and scurried over. \u201cIs that any chance you had a dress Beauregard could borrow? I can\u2019t be alone with her mother for much longer.\u201d</p><p>Jester frowned. \u201cI could probably find one she could wear, but I think finding one she would wear is entirely a different story probably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a skort?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA skirt with shorts under it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah! I have the perfect thing! Oh, she\u2019s gonna love it!\u201d</p><p>Caleb highly doubted that but he let Jester leave the dining room. The room fell into silence and Caleb started fidgeting with his fork, tapping it lightly against the table. \u201cSo, Mr. Widogast,\u201d Georgina started. \u201cTell me about yourself. We haven\u2019t gotten much chance to speak one on one. How are you and my daughter getting along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwimmingly, Madam,\u201d he said. \u201cThis morning she organized a quick scavenger hunt for me that was\u2026 so fun.\u201d</p><p>The woman raised a perfectly manicured eyebrow. \u201cReally? That doesn\u2019t sound like my daughter. You must bring out the best in her.\u201d She seemed like she was about to continue but the main doors to the hall opened and the Caleb could have sworn that the temperature in the room dropped ten degrees. Georgina, still standing, turned and smiled widely at the man. \u201cEston! Dear, this is the man I told you about. Caleb Widogast, meet my husband, Sir Eston Theodore Lionett.\u201d</p><p>Caleb moved to stand as Eston got close and when he shook his hand Eston squeezed. It was hard to tell if the squeeze was meant as a threat or just an honest ignorance of his own strength. \u201cCaleb. Good to meet you. I\u2019ve heard wonderful things about you from Professor Ikethon.\u201d</p><p>Caleb cleared his throat, subtly shaking out his fingers when Eston dropped his hand and continued passed him towards the head of the table. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve heard wonderful things about you from your wife.\u201d And seen the horrible things you\u2019ve done to your daughter, but he didn\u2019t say that part out loud. He took his seat again as Georgina finally took her own.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Beauregard?\u201d Eston asked, waving at the servants to start bringing out the food.</p><p>Caleb spoke up quickly before Georgina could start complaining. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t decide on a dress. She\u2019ll be down shortly.\u201d</p><p>Eston seemed satisfied with the answer and dropped the subject as a plate stacked high with food was set in front of him. \u201cGood. Good, I want to hear all about this whirlwind romance between the two of you.\u201d</p><p>Caleb choked on his words and leaned into his elbow to cough. \u201cWh-Whirlwind romance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Georgina said she\u2019s scheduled the wedding for a month from now, that\u2019s a bit soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I just thought that these two love birds would like to be married as soon as possible,\u201d Georgina said without a hint of irony. \u201cDoes that sound good for you and your family Caleb?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, my family is dead.\u201d He mentally kicked himself when they both froze and turned to stare at him in unison.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s so sad,\u201d Georgina said. \u201cSo, will you not be needing a table at the reception? Because if not I\u2019m going to need to replan my table orientation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Caleb said, clearing his throat. \u201cNo, I will not be needing a table. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>She turned back to her meal and continued eating but Eston was still watching him. \u201cDo you mind if I ask how they died, son?\u201d</p><p>Caleb decided to put the \u2018son\u2019 on the back burner of concerns for right now and focus on the most pressing one. He could freak about about the rest of this interaction after it was over. \u201cFire. Arson, while I was at the Academy. We\u2019re not sure who did it.\u201d That was the official story at least.</p><p>Suddenly, the door behind him was thrown open and he turned around, hopeful. Could it be? Was he saved? He never thought that he\u2019d be happy to see Beau marching into a room like she was marching into a battle but right now he needed her. The more time he spent with the people who raised her, the more he understood her issues. She wasn\u2019t wearing a dress exactly, but it was elegant and covered her midriff so hopefully Georgina wouldn\u2019t mind too much. It was a silver jumpsuit, the legs long enough to drape around her feet which were certainly not in high heels and wide enough that if she were to stand up straight with her legs together it would look like a dress, not that there was any chance of that happening. It was cinched at the waist, sleeveless, and low cut, the point of the collar starting just below her sternum and coming up loose around her shoulders to drape elegantly down her back. Her hair was pulled over one shoulder and braided intricately with beads and ribbons. She was wearing a band around her chest and she wasn\u2019t wearing shoes, so he was pretty sure that this person was actually Beau and not a very well done fake.</p><p>\u201cBeauregard,\u201d Georgina said, dropping her fork so that it clanged against her plate. \u201cWhere did you get that?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged and moved around the table to her chair. \u201cJust something I had in the back of my closet. Something wrong, Mother?\u201d</p><p>Georgina shook her head. \u201cNo, it\u2019s acceptable. Have a seat.\u201d</p><p>Beau did so and coughed into her fist, shifting uncomfortably. \u201cYou alright?\u201d Caleb asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cThis fancy fabric chafes,\u201d she muttered. </p><p>\u201cWhere did you actually get that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJester. It\u2019s her mom\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>That just gave him more questions than it answered but there would be time for that later. \u201cBeauregard, you look very handsome tonight,\u201d he said, loud enough for her parents to hear.</p><p>Her nose scrunched. \u201cEw, don\u2019t say it like that.\u201d Georgina cleared her throat pointedly and glared at her, causing Beau to roll her eyes. \u201cYou look nice too. Your tie doesn\u2019t match the drapes though, you should work on that.\u201d</p><p>Eston spoke up before she could say anything else. \u201cWe were just discussing the wedding, actually.\u201d</p><p>Beau shoved a spoonful of breakfast potatoes in her mouth. \u201cWhat wedding?\u201d she asked through food.</p><p>\u201cYour wedding, dear,\u201d Georgina siad. She was scowling at her daughter\u2019s manners but must have decided to pick her battles more carefully. This was no the hill she wanted to die on.</p><p>\u201cSweet, who am I marrying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be obtuse,\u201d Eston sneered. He looked frighteningly like his daughter when he did that.</p><p>She shrugged and grinned like she had no care in the world. \u201cJust being myself, Father. Maybe an obtuse person shouldn\u2019t be getting married to someone she met two days ago?\u201d</p><p>Her parents started tag teaming. \u201cThis behavior is going to scare Mr. Widogast away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want him to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to be alone for the rest of your life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to be a disappointment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to be a laughingstock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to be a failure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Beau said suddenly. \u201cYes, I want all of those things. I want to be a lonely, happy failure.\u201d</p><p>Georgina waved her hand dismissively. \u201cBeing happy is vastly overrated, darling.\u201d</p><p>Beau scratched at the back of her neck and shifted awkwardly in her jumpsuit but didn\u2019t say anything more for now. Aftera few silent minutes, Eston spoke up. \u201cCaleb, what was it that you were saying before Beauregard interrupted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout my dead parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould we have known them? I don\u2019t believe Widogast is a name I\u2019m familiar with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, no. No, we were poor. The Academy gave me a chance to better myself and I believe I have done quite well since then.\u201d He hoped his answer didn\u2019t sound as stilted and rehearsed as it felt. Beau was giving him a weird look so maybe she didn\u2019t believe him but Eston and Georgina seemed none the wiser. \u201cI suspect that the wealthy people of this empire will be hearing the name Widogast quite frequently as the years go on.\u201d</p><p>Eston chuckled. \u201cYes, I like your spirit. We need more go-getters like you. My daughter could learn a thing or two from you.\u201d Beau scowled down at her eggs but didn\u2019t say anything. Caleb let out a breath of relief and tried to meet Beau\u2019s eyes across the table but she was purposefully ignoring him by taking a large drink from her cup. \u201cSo, how many children will you two be having?\u201d</p><p>Beau spit her water across the table and Caleb cringed when he felt droplets hit his face. Beau swiped the back of her hand across her mouth. \u201cNone! What the fuck, what kind of question is that?\u201d</p><p>Eston got to his feet in a fluid motion and slammed his hands open palmed on the table. \u201cYou will not speak to me that way. And I wasn\u2019t talking to you, anyway. Don\u2019t speak unless spoken to, Beauregard. Someone clean up that mess.\u201d As a servant ran over to start wiping up the table, Eston turned back to Caleb. \u201cIgnore her. How many children will you be having?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhhhhhhhhhh\u2026\u201d Caleb wiped his face off with his sleeve. \u201cI believe that is a question for your daughter.\u201d</p><p>Beau snorted in surprised amusement and gave him a bewildered look but didn\u2019t respond. Eston frowned. \u201cWell, I am perhaps beginning to understand what my daughter sees in you. You have a bit of a rebellious streak too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that, Sir, I just believe that Beauregard is in charge of that particular decision.\u201d</p><p>Eston leaned back in his chair and smirked. \u201cYou\u2019re teasing me. That was a good one.\u201d</p><p>Caleb opened his mouth to contradict him but paused when he felt Beau tapping his knee with her foot to get his attention. He looked over at her and she shook her head. \u201cHe won\u2019t understand. I think he\u2019s purposely misunderstanding.\u201d</p><p>Caleb sighed. \u201cThree, Sir. We\u2019ll be having three children.\u201d</p><p>Eston nodded. \u201cThree. Good number. I was the eldest of three, you know.\u201d</p><p>Georgina sighed. \u201cWe wanted more children, after Beauregard and her brother, but for some reason they just never took.\u201d</p><p>Caleb blinked and caught Beau\u2019s eyes but she was staring down at her plate. \u201cBrother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Beauregard\u2019s twin, Eston Junior.

Caleb gripped his fork tightly in his fist. The food hadn\u2019t been brought out yet, but if he didn\u2019t hold something he wasn\u2019t sure what his hand would be doing right now. He took a deep breath and turned back to look at Jester. She got the message and scurried over. \u201cIs that any chance you had a dress Beauregard could borrow? I can\u2019t be alone with her mother for much longer.\u201d</p><p>Jester frowned. \u201cI could probably find one she could wear, but I think finding one she would wear is entirely a different story probably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a skort?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA skirt with shorts under it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah! I have the perfect thing! Oh, she\u2019s gonna love it!\u201d</p><p>Caleb highly doubted that but he let Jester leave the dining room. The room fell into silence and Caleb started fidgeting with his fork, tapping it lightly against the table. \u201cSo, Mr. Widogast,\u201d Georgina started. \u201cTell me about yourself. We haven\u2019t gotten much chance to speak one on one. How are you and my daughter getting along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwimmingly, Madam,\u201d he said. \u201cThis morning she organized a quick scavenger hunt for me that was\u2026 so fun.\u201d</p><p>The woman raised a perfectly manicured eyebrow. \u201cReally? That doesn\u2019t sound like my daughter. You must bring out the best in her.\u201d She seemed like she was about to continue but the main doors to the hall opened and the Caleb could have sworn that the temperature in the room dropped ten degrees. Georgina, still standing, turned and smiled widely at the man. \u201cEston! Dear, this is the man I told you about. Caleb Widogast, meet my husband, Sir Eston Theodore Lionett.\u201d</p><p>Caleb moved to stand as Eston got close and when he shook his hand Eston squeezed. It was hard to tell if the squeeze was meant as a threat or just an honest ignorance of his own strength. \u201cCaleb. Good to meet you. I\u2019ve heard wonderful things about you from Professor Ikethon.\u201d</p><p>Caleb cleared his throat, subtly shaking out his fingers when Eston dropped his hand and continued passed him towards the head of the table. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve heard wonderful things about you from your wife.\u201d And seen the horrible things you\u2019ve done to your daughter, but he didn\u2019t say that part out loud. He took his seat again as Georgina finally took her own.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Beauregard?\u201d Eston asked, waving at the servants to start bringing out the food.</p><p>Caleb spoke up quickly before Georgina could start complaining. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t decide on a dress. She\u2019ll be down shortly.\u201d</p><p>Eston seemed satisfied with the answer and dropped the subject as a plate stacked high with food was set in front of him. \u201cGood. Good, I want to hear all about this whirlwind romance between the two of you.\u201d</p><p>Caleb choked on his words and leaned into his elbow to cough. \u201cWh-Whirlwind romance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Georgina said she\u2019s scheduled the wedding for a month from now, that\u2019s a bit soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I just thought that these two love birds would like to be married as soon as possible,\u201d Georgina said without a hint of irony. \u201cDoes that sound good for you and your family Caleb?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, my family is dead.\u201d He mentally kicked himself when they both froze and turned to stare at him in unison.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s so sad,\u201d Georgina said. \u201cSo, will you not be needing a table at the reception? Because if not I\u2019m going to need to replan my table orientation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Caleb said, clearing his throat. \u201cNo, I will not be needing a table. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>She turned back to her meal and continued eating but Eston was still watching him. \u201cDo you mind if I ask how they died, son?\u201d</p><p>Caleb decided to put the \u2018son\u2019 on the back burner of concerns for right now and focus on the most pressing one. He could freak about about the rest of this interaction after it was over. \u201cFire. Arson, while I was at the Academy. We\u2019re not sure who did it.\u201d That was the official story at least.</p><p>Suddenly, the door behind him was thrown open and he turned around, hopeful. Could it be? Was he saved? He never thought that he\u2019d be happy to see Beau marching into a room like she was marching into a battle but right now he needed her. The more time he spent with the people who raised her, the more he understood her issues. She wasn\u2019t wearing a dress exactly, but it was elegant and covered her midriff so hopefully Georgina wouldn\u2019t mind too much. It was a silver jumpsuit, the legs long enough to drape around her feet which were certainly not in high heels and wide enough that if she were to stand up straight with her legs together it would look like a dress, not that there was any chance of that happening. It was cinched at the waist, sleeveless, and low cut, the point of the collar starting just below her sternum and coming up loose around her shoulders to drape elegantly down her back. Her hair was pulled over one shoulder and braided intricately with beads and ribbons. She was wearing a band around her chest and she wasn\u2019t wearing shoes, so he was pretty sure that this person was actually Beau and not a very well done fake.</p><p>\u201cBeauregard,\u201d Georgina said, dropping her fork so that it clanged against her plate. \u201cWhere did you get that?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged and moved around the table to her chair. \u201cJust something I had in the back of my closet. Something wrong, Mother?\u201d</p><p>Georgina shook her head. \u201cNo, it\u2019s acceptable. Have a seat.\u201d</p><p>Beau did so and coughed into her fist, shifting uncomfortably. \u201cYou alright?\u201d Caleb asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cThis fancy fabric chafes,\u201d she muttered. </p><p>\u201cWhere did you actually get that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJester. It\u2019s her mom\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>That just gave him more questions than it answered but there would be time for that later. \u201cBeauregard, you look very handsome tonight,\u201d he said, loud enough for her parents to hear.</p><p>Her nose scrunched. \u201cEw, don\u2019t say it like that.\u201d Georgina cleared her throat pointedly and glared at her, causing Beau to roll her eyes. \u201cYou look nice too. Your tie doesn\u2019t match the drapes though, you should work on that.\u201d</p><p>Eston spoke up before she could say anything else. \u201cWe were just discussing the wedding, actually.\u201d</p><p>Beau shoved a spoonful of breakfast potatoes in her mouth. \u201cWhat wedding?\u201d she asked through food.</p><p>\u201cYour wedding, dear,\u201d Georgina siad. She was scowling at her daughter\u2019s manners but must have decided to pick her battles more carefully. This was no the hill she wanted to die on.</p><p>\u201cSweet, who am I marrying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be obtuse,\u201d Eston sneered. He looked frighteningly like his daughter when he did that.</p><p>She shrugged and grinned like she had no care in the world. \u201cJust being myself, Father. Maybe an obtuse person shouldn\u2019t be getting married to someone she met two days ago?\u201d</p><p>Her parents started tag teaming. \u201cThis behavior is going to scare Mr. Widogast away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want him to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to be alone for the rest of your life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to be a disappointment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to be a laughingstock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to be a failure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Beau said suddenly. \u201cYes, I want all of those things. I want to be a lonely, happy failure.\u201d</p><p>Georgina waved her hand dismissively. \u201cBeing happy is vastly overrated, darling.\u201d</p><p>Beau scratched at the back of her neck and shifted awkwardly in her jumpsuit but didn\u2019t say anything more for now. Aftera few silent minutes, Eston spoke up. \u201cCaleb, what was it that you were saying before Beauregard interrupted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout my dead parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould we have known them? I don\u2019t believe Widogast is a name I\u2019m familiar with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, no. No, we were poor. The Academy gave me a chance to better myself and I believe I have done quite well since then.\u201d He hoped his answer didn\u2019t sound as stilted and rehearsed as it felt. Beau was giving him a weird look so maybe she didn\u2019t believe him but Eston and Georgina seemed none the wiser. \u201cI suspect that the wealthy people of this empire will be hearing the name Widogast quite frequently as the years go on.\u201d</p><p>Eston chuckled. \u201cYes, I like your spirit. We need more go-getters like you. My daughter could learn a thing or two from you.\u201d Beau scowled down at her eggs but didn\u2019t say anything. Caleb let out a breath of relief and tried to meet Beau\u2019s eyes across the table but she was purposefully ignoring him by taking a large drink from her cup. \u201cSo, how many children will you two be having?\u201d</p><p>Beau spit her water across the table and Caleb cringed when he felt droplets hit his face. Beau swiped the back of her hand across her mouth. \u201cNone! What the fuck, what kind of question is that?\u201d</p><p>Eston got to his feet in a fluid motion and slammed his hands open palmed on the table. \u201cYou will not speak to me that way. And I wasn\u2019t talking to you, anyway. Don\u2019t speak unless spoken to, Beauregard. Someone clean up that mess.\u201d As a servant ran over to start wiping up the table, Eston turned back to Caleb. \u201cIgnore her. How many children will you be having?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhhhhhhhhhh\u2026\u201d Caleb wiped his face off with his sleeve. \u201cI believe that is a question for your daughter.\u201d</p><p>Beau snorted in surprised amusement and gave him a bewildered look but didn\u2019t respond. Eston frowned. \u201cWell, I am perhaps beginning to understand what my daughter sees in you. You have a bit of a rebellious streak too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that, Sir, I just believe that Beauregard is in charge of that particular decision.\u201d</p><p>Eston leaned back in his chair and smirked. \u201cYou\u2019re teasing me. That was a good one.\u201d</p><p>Caleb opened his mouth to contradict him but paused when he felt Beau tapping his knee with her foot to get his attention. He looked over at her and she shook her head. \u201cHe won\u2019t understand. I think he\u2019s purposely misunderstanding.\u201d</p><p>Caleb sighed. \u201cThree, Sir. We\u2019ll be having three children.\u201d</p><p>Eston nodded. \u201cThree. Good number. I was the eldest of three, you know.\u201d</p><p>Georgina sighed. \u201cWe wanted more children, after Beauregard and her brother, but for some reason they just never took.\u201d</p><p>Caleb blinked and caught Beau\u2019s eyes but she was staring down at her plate. \u201cBrother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Beauregard\u2019s twin, Eston Junior. Unfortunately he passed away when they were six. He was the eldest, he would have been the heir had things been different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Eston Senior muttered. \u201cShame, that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we not talk about EJ at the table please,\u201d Beau interrupted. \u201cMy dead brother is not exactly the best conversation to have over food, thanks.\u201d</p><p>Before Eston could start up another lecture, Caleb changed the subject. \u201cYes, actually, Sir Lionett. Why don\u2019t you tell me about your work?\u201d</p><p>The older man\u2019s face brightened. \u201cI\u2019m a winemaker. Well, I own the winemaking company, I haven\u2019t actually made any wine by my hand since long before I was married. My family growing up was not very well off, we were fine, but I don\u2019t think my parents ever dreamed their son would rise this high. I\u2019ll be sure to get you a good year to go with dinner tonight. It will be the most superb wine you\u2019ve ever tasted. We\u2019re sending out a new shipment in two weeks, I\u2019ll be sure to get you a bottle from that batch before it heads out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you, Sir. I can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>Eston started getting into more details of the business but Caleb mostly tuned him out, choosing instead to look at Beau as she started jotting numbers down on a piece of paper that was half hidden under her plate. The only part he could make out was \u2018New shipment, two weeks\u2019 then the young woman shoved the paper back under the plate and resumed eating.</p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h2>A Marriage of Convenience {Chapter Four}</h2><p><i>The more I write about Beau&rsquo;s parents the more I can&rsquo;t wait for them to get what&rsquo;s coming. </i></p><p>Georgina Lionett was checking her teeth in a mirror when Caleb walked into the Grand Hall. She was wearing the nicest dress he&rsquo;d seen so far like she was dressing for a special occasion. Caleb felt underdressed and this was the best suit he owned. He cleared his throat and she jumped, spinning around. &ldquo;Ah, Mr. Widogast! Please, take a seat, my husband will be down here in a few moments. &ldquo; She scurried over to her own chair and just stood beside it, not moving to seat herself.</p><p>&ldquo;You look lovely this morning, Madam,&rdquo; he said awkwardly taking a seat. </p><p>She blushed and fixed a loose strand of hair. &ldquo;Thank you, sir. My husband doesn&rsquo;t come to eat with us often, everything needs to be perfect.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where is Beauregard?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s been told that she is not allowed to join us unless she comes properly dressed. She told me that she didn&rsquo;t have any dresses and sure enough, there was nothing suitable in her closet. I don&rsquo;t know what she did with them, I suspect ritual burning.&rdquo;</p><p>He looked back at Jester, who was determined to actually follow him around all day and she was biting her lip to suppress a grin. &lsquo;You know?&rsquo; he mouthed at her silently.</p><p>She grinned and nodded. &lsquo;I took them to town for her.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;To burn?&rsquo;</p><p>Then she either said &lsquo;To donate&rsquo; or &lsquo;To prostate&rsquo;. He figured it was probably the first one based on the context of the conversation.</p><p>Georgina seemed to suddenly realize that Jester was there and frowned. &ldquo;Are you feeling ill, Mr. Widogast?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, no! No, I&rsquo;m perfectly fine. Jester kindly offered to show me around after I got lost and she found me wandering the halls.&rdquo; Georgina opened her mouth to speak but Caleb didn&rsquo;t want her to push on this topic. He cleared his throat. &ldquo;I heard you were attacked this morning?&rdquo;</p><p>The woman gasped dramatically. &ldquo;Oh, it was terrifying. Somehow a goblin found its way to my room. It was crazed, coming right for me. I&rsquo;m still a bit shaken. And the worst part is that it hasn&rsquo;t been found yet. It could still be in this house somewhere, can you imagine?&rdquo; She shuddered. &ldquo;It probably has rabies, the beast.&rdquo;</p><p>Yeah, this was perhaps a bad subject to change to. Caleb gripped his fork tightly in his fist. The food hadn&rsquo;t been brought out yet, but if he didn&rsquo;t hold something he wasn&rsquo;t sure what his hand would be doing right now.

Well, I own the winemaking company, I haven&rsquo;t actually made any wine by my hand since long before I was married. My family growing up was not very well off, we were fine, but I don&rsquo;t think my parents ever dreamed their son would rise this high. I&rsquo;ll be sure to get you a good year to go with dinner tonight. It will be the most superb wine you&rsquo;ve ever tasted. We&rsquo;re sending out a new shipment in two weeks, I&rsquo;ll be sure to get you a bottle from that batch before it heads out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I believe you, Sir. I can&rsquo;t wait.&rdquo;</p><p>Eston started getting into more details of the business but Caleb mostly tuned him out, choosing instead to look at Beau as she started jotting numbers down on a piece of paper that was half hidden under her plate. The only part he could make out was &lsquo;New shipment, two weeks&rsquo; then the young woman shoved the paper back under the plate and resumed eating.</p></p>",

She was wearing the nicest dress he&rsquo;d seen so far like she was dressing for a special occasion. Caleb felt underdressed and this was the best suit he owned. He cleared his throat and she jumped, spinning around. &ldquo;Ah, Mr. Widogast! Please, take a seat, my husband will be down here in a few moments. &ldquo; She scurried over to her own chair and just stood beside it, not moving to seat herself.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You look lovely this morning, Madam,&rdquo; he said awkwardly taking a seat. </p>\n<p>She blushed and fixed a loose strand of hair. &ldquo;Thank you, sir. My husband doesn&rsquo;t come to eat with us often, everything needs to be perfect.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Where is Beauregard?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s been told that she is not allowed to join us unless she comes properly dressed. She told me that she didn&rsquo;t have any dresses and sure enough, there was nothing suitable in her closet. I don&rsquo;t know what she did with them, I suspect ritual burning.&rdquo;</p>\n</p>",
