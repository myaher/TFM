He went there, of course, taking all of the proper precautions to not be detected by the security and it was all going well until something went wrong. He still wasn\u2019t sure what exactly it was, but something went wrong. Maybe it was Captain America refusing to attack him? Claiming that they were friends and that he was Bucky, not the Winter Soldier. It had to be that. It had thrown him off. He had failed his mission. He assumed that someone had knocked him out since he woke up in a cell strapped to a chair.</p><p>That had been months ago and he still couldn\u2019t tell someone what had fully happened that night. The Avengers were working hard along with S.H.I.E.L.D to rehabilitate him and it was working. He had learned that his name was James Buchanan \u201dBucky\u201d Barnes and with a quick trip to the Smithsonian Museum, he learned about his past. Steve also helped him fill in the blanks, joke around with him and help him remember things. Steve looked so happy when he corrected Steve on a particular story he was telling.\u00a0\u201cNo, you\u2019re the one who tripped over your feet while dancing with that girl. You were too drunk to stand, Stevie. I had to carry you home!\u201d What came after was a series of chuckles and a grinning Steve. That didn\u2019t last for too long.</p><p>If three things were clear about Bucky, it was that he was far calmer than he had been before but still unstable. The next thing being the most important, Bucky was more Winter Soldier than Bucky Barnes. That was very clear. No matter how much Steve tried, Bucky was still more Winter Soldier. He had gotten most of his memories back and most of the time he was calm, but the would have episodes, moments even when it was truly evident that the Soldier was ingrained\u00a0in him so deeply that he would never leave. Bucky had told Steve that himself.</p><p>Steve become quite mopey after that, residing in Natasha who was already wary of Bucky. It only made that worse. Bucky felt like everything was falling apart, he no longer had the Brooklyn accent that made all of the ladies swoon back in the day. Instead, there was an easily understandable, yet slightly thick Russian accent in its place. He could tell that Steve wasn\u2019t used to it.\u00a0</p><p>There was only one person who actually made him feel like he wasn\u2019t a monster and believe it or not that was Tony Stark. They had formed an interestingly close bond over the months of Bucky residing in Stark Tower. Tony resented Bucky\u2019s presence there, but slowly over time it transitioned. Tony became Bucky\u2019s escape, he became his control. He needed control, it was something that he had to constantly battle for himself. It wasn\u2019t until five months after Bucky being there after they had shared quite a passionate kiss in the empty lab did Tony suggest the idea.</p><p>\u201cBuck, what do you think about some pet play?\u201d Tony knew that Bucky liked being in control since he felt like it was something he had lacked. Bucky didn\u2019t know what it was. Once Tony showed and explained what it was Bucky was into it.\u00a0</p><p>They only really did it whenever they knew for a fact that they were alone. Tony would sit naked on the floor in front of wherever Bucky was sitting with a butt plug that had a tail attached to it.

Whenever Tony was a bad boy there were punishments and when Tony was a good boy there were rewards.</p><p>It was a particular and lonely afternoon, the Avengers were doing whatever they were doing. Tony stayed behind and so did Bucky to do some\u00a0\u2018work\u2019 on Bucky\u2019s memories. They were in the living room, Tony on the floor with the same get up. He was whimpering, nudging at his master\u2019s leg to get off. You see, Bucky had been whispering quite dirty things to Tony all day.

The Avengers were working hard along with S.H.I.E.L.D to rehabilitate him and it was working.

Steve looked so happy when he corrected Steve on a particular story he was telling.\u00a0\u201cNo, you\u2019re the one who tripped over your feet while dancing with that girl.

Bucky had told Steve that himself.</p><p>Steve become quite mopey after that, residing in Natasha who was already wary of Bucky. It only made that worse. Bucky felt like everything was falling apart, he no longer had the Brooklyn accent that made all of the ladies swoon back in the day.

They had formed an interestingly close bond over the months of Bucky residing in Stark Tower. Tony resented Bucky\u2019s presence there, but slowly over time it transitioned. Tony became Bucky\u2019s escape, he became his control. He needed control, it was something that he had to constantly battle for himself.

Happy coughed as he sat there, unsure of what to do. Making an executive decision and a desperate attempt to get out of the palpably awkward situation he got out of the car and made his way around to the trunk to get the bags out.\u00a0</p><p>Tony didn\u2019t move. He noted Happy\u2019s movements but his head never turned, instead he looked dead ahead as his mind raced at a million miles a minute thinking over everything that had happened in the last 24 hours. He could hear the crunch of the gravel outside as Happy shifted from one foot to another, wondering what to do for the best. Tony looked out of the window. The house was in darkness. The garage was locked, which was odd in itself. With the expensive security system that protected the perimeter of the house, Howard almost always left the garage unlocked and many of his cars on the vast drive so he could pick whichever one he wanted on a whim. Snow was littered all along the grounds though there was not a Christmas decoration in sight, if he remembered rightly last year they had put it off until Tony had come home for the holidays \u2013 something that only happened on the 24<sup>th</sup> of December as he rolled in unannounced before heading back out for a party with his friends in Miami.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Taking a deep breath, he climbed out of the car and onto the gravel. He stood, taking in the view for a moment before he turned to happy.<br/>\u2018Ready when you are,\u2019 the large man said, gesturing for Tony to move forward but he didn\u2019t. He looked at Happy for a moment and then said, \u2018it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m going to go in alone. Thank you.\u2019<br/>\u2018But Tony-\u2019 his assistant and friend started but Tony didn\u2019t listen. Instead, he merely moved forward and grabbed his bags from the ground at Happy\u2019s feet before he walked ahead off the gravel to the steps to the front door. He moved quickly, desperate to get out of Happy\u2019s line of view, and was soon inside the door and resting against it.<br/>\u00a0<br/>He let his head fall back against the cold oak, his eyes falling shut as his breathing attempted to even itself out. Dumping his bags on the floor he opened his eyes and walked forward into the empty reception hall. His footsteps echoed throughout the empty house, a feeling that filled him with increasing sadness. As he walked lights flicked on throughout the house, responding to his movements.<br/>\u00a0<br/>As he went into the living room he noted that something was off. It wasn\u2019t pristine. Since he had been a child this house had been a museum, a pinnacle of wealth and success. Now it was littered with things that shouldn\u2019t have been there. Upon the mantel and surrounding tables were stacks of cards and flowers. These weren\u2019t the ornate bouquets handpicked for a party these were haphazard and cheap. Tony could tell. Stuffed animals were scattered around the fireplace. Everything looked out of place.<br/>\u00a0<br/>He moved forward and grasped a bouquet.<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u2018<i>To Tony,<br/>Thinking of you at this sad time.<br/>Love Ann and Bill x\u2019<br/>\u00a0</i><br/>And then another.<br/>\u00a0<br/><i>\u2018Sorry for your loss,<br/>The Stark Industries Marketing team.\u2019<br/>\u00a0</i><br/>He grabbed card upon card and tore them open, reading the tirade of do-gooders giving him their faux sadness. Valentina must have brought them in. Anger boiled in him, and he stomped through to the kitchen and pulled open every cupboard until he found a roll of bin liners before he moved back to the living room and started to slam everything inside an open bag. It was therapeutic tearing everything down, slamming it into the bag. Once everything was packed up he looked around he couldn\u2019t stop himself, he went into a frenzy, tearing everything that was personal down and in the bag. He went to their bedroom and opened the closet, throwing things off the hangers and into the bag. Tailored suits, crisp linen pants and rafts of jewellery were scattered around the room as they stopped fitting in the trash.\u00a0</p><p>By the time he stopped the floor was covered in broken glass, clothes, papers and so much more. He continued hoping that this would get rid of all the hurt that was crushing him. He found his fathers\u2019 study to be the most cathartic and for a vague moment, his mind was distracted. Room after room he blitzed until he hit the library.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Maria\u2019s favourite place. As Tony entered a waft of her perfume hit his nose bringing with it another crushing wave of sadness. He moved into the room and to her favourite chair, where she\u2019d curl up at night whilst his father was working and read her favourite stories. There was still a half-drunk cup of tea on the table next to the chair as well as a picture. It was of her 15 years ago or so with a child Tony as they sat in that very room reading his favourite book. Howard had taken the picture after compromising with Maria that they would come down to the lab after they had finished as he wanted to show off his newest invention.<br/>\u00a0<br/>The pain hit Tony like a truck. He had tried so hard to put it out of his mind but now he was forced to sit down on his mothers\u2019 reading chair and try and compose himself. Whenever he had cried as a child Howard had scolded him, telling him that whenever he felt sad there was no reason to cry. A strong man, a real man, kept his composure and dealt with the problem. But that didn\u2019t matter now, they were gone. A fault, a stupid mechanical failure took away one of the most technically gifted minds ever. And his mother, an innocent bystander had gotten caught up in an accident that his father should have been prepared for! The tears started to spill over and he sat there, crying as he clutched the picture frame against his chest as if that would somehow reverse the damage that had evolved from the last couple of days.<br/>\u00a0<br/>He didn\u2019t even notice the movement through the house and was only aware of a presence as a voice said from the door, \u2018Oh Tony.\u2019<br/>\u00a0<br/>It was Peggy. She stood in the doorway wide-eyed looking down at Tony\u2019s broken form with sadness. Peggy had known for their family for years since Tony was a boy. She was his godmother but she was so much more than that, she was family. Though Maria had been adamantly involved in Tony\u2019s life, Howard had been somewhat vacant opting to work rather than a parent. Peggy had taken up some of the slack and raised him into the boy he was today.<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u2018Aunty Peg,\u2019 he said feeling his face grow cold as his tears started to stem. She moved forward into the room and knelt beside the chair, wiping his eyes.<br/>\u2018I heard about everything, I came straight away.\u2019<br/>\u2018They\u2019re gone-\u2019<br/>\u2018I know. Tony dear, what happened to the house? My God.\u2019<br/>\u2018I was upset.\u2019<br/>\u2018Oh Tony,\u2019 she whispered.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Neither of them knew how long they had sat there, holding each other as tears spilt onto the soft cotton chair and the plush carpet beneath them. Eventually, Peggy patted Tony\u2019s leg and stood, smoothing out her skirt as she headed for the door.<br/>\u2018Where are you going?\u2019 he asked in a thick voice.<br/>\u2018I\u2019m going to make some tea and tidy up. You\u2019re going to take a shower and meet me downstairs.\u2019<br/>\u2018Peg-\u2019<br/>\u2018No exceptions. You\u2019re angry I know but your parents don\u2019t deserve to have their house trashed.\u2019<br/>\u2018They don\u2019t care, they\u2019re dead,\u2019 Tony said bitterly.<br/>\u2018All the more reason to show them a little respect. Once you\u2019re done you can put my suitcases in the guest bedroom, and call Happy. He\u2019s worried about you.\u2019<br/>\u00a0<br/>With a flurry, she disappeared downstairs. Tony said nothing though part of him wanted to act out like a small child and tell her to get the hell out. She was right though he supposed. Sure, it was just stuff, materialistic things that didn\u2019t matter but it was theirs \u2013 their life made up of items, memorise. Rising from the chair he walked out of the room and down the hall, stripping his clothes as he went. Once he was in the bathroom he turned on the scalding hot shower and stepped under the steady stream of water allowing it to wash over his body. It was a small comfort. As the water washed down his face he was happy that he could cry without the embarrassment of another person knowing.</p>",

He moved into the room and to her favourite chair, where she\u2019d curl up at night whilst his father was working and read her favourite stories. There was still a half-drunk cup of tea on the table next to the chair as well as a picture. It was of her 15 years ago or so with a child Tony as they sat in that very room reading his favourite book. Howard had taken the picture after compromising with Maria that they would come down to the lab after they had finished as he wanted to show off his newest invention.<br>\u00a0<br>The pain hit Tony like a truck. He had tried so hard to put it out of his mind but now he was forced to sit down on his mothers\u2019 reading chair and try and compose himself. Whenever he had cried as a child Howard had scolded him, telling him that whenever he felt sad there was no reason to cry. A strong man, a real man, kept his composure and dealt with the problem. But that didn\u2019t matter now, they were gone. A fault, a stupid mechanical failure took away one of the most technically gifted minds ever. And his mother, an innocent bystander had gotten caught up in an accident that his father should have been prepared for!

She stood in the doorway wide-eyed looking down at Tony\u2019s broken form with sadness. Peggy had known for their family for years since Tony was a boy. She was his godmother but she was so much more than that, she was family. Though Maria had been adamantly involved in Tony\u2019s life, Howard had been somewhat vacant opting to work rather than a parent. Peggy had taken up some of the slack and raised him into the boy he was today.<br>\u00a0<br>\u2018Aunty Peg,\u2019 he said feeling his face grow cold as his tears started to stem. She moved forward into the room and knelt beside the chair, wiping his eyes.<br>\u2018I heard about everything, I came straight away.\u2019<br>\u2018They\u2019re gone-\u2019<br>\u2018I know. Tony dear, what happened to the house? My God.\u2019<br>\u2018I was upset.\u2019<br>\u2018Oh Tony,\u2019 she whispered.<br>\u00a0<br>Neither of them knew how long they had sat there, holding each other as tears spilt onto the soft cotton chair and the plush carpet beneath them. Eventually, Peggy patted Tony\u2019s leg and stood, smoothing out her skirt as she headed for the door.<br>\u2018Where are you going?\u2019 he asked in a thick voice.<br>\u2018I\u2019m going to make some tea and tidy up. You\u2019re going to take a shower and meet me downstairs.\u2019<br>\u2018Peg-\u2019<br>\u2018No exceptions. You\u2019re angry I know but your parents don\u2019t deserve to have their house trashed.\u2019<br>\u2018They don\u2019t care, they\u2019re dead,\u2019 Tony said bitterly.<br>\u2018All the more reason to show them a little respect. Once you\u2019re done you can put my suitcases in the guest bedroom, and call Happy. He\u2019s worried about you.\u2019<br>\u00a0<br>With a flurry, she disappeared downstairs. Tony said nothing though part of him wanted to act out like a small child and tell her to get the hell out. She was right though he supposed. Sure, it was just stuff, materialistic things that didn\u2019t matter but it was theirs \u2013 their life made up of items, memorise. Rising from the chair he walked out of the room and down the hall, stripping his clothes as he went. Once he was in the bathroom he turned on the scalding hot shower and stepped under the steady stream of water allowing it to wash over his body. It was a small comfort. As the water washed down his face he was happy that he could cry without the embarrassment of another person knowing.</p>",

Making an executive decision and a desperate attempt to get out of the palpably awkward situation he got out of the car and made his way around to the trunk to get the bags out.\u00a0</p><p>Tony didn\u2019t move. He noted Happy\u2019s movements but his head never turned, instead he looked dead ahead as his mind raced at a million miles a minute thinking over everything that had happened in the last 24 hours. He could hear the crunch of the gravel outside as Happy shifted from one foot to another, wondering what to do for the best. Tony looked out of the window. The house was in darkness. The garage was locked, which was odd in itself. With the expensive security system that protected the perimeter of the house, Howard almost always left the garage unlocked and many of his cars on the vast drive so he could pick whichever one he wanted on a whim. Snow was littered all along the grounds though there was not a Christmas decoration in sight, if he remembered rightly last year they had put it off until Tony had come home for the holidays \u2013 something that only happened on the 24<sup>th</sup> of December as he rolled in unannounced before heading back out for a party with his friends in Miami.<br>\u00a0<br>Taking a deep breath, he climbed out of the car and onto the gravel. He stood, taking in the view for a moment before he turned to happy.<br>\u2018Ready when you are,\u2019 the large man said, gesturing for Tony to move forward but he didn\u2019t. He looked at Happy for a moment and then said, \u2018it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m going to go in alone. Thank you.\u2019<br>\u2018But Tony-\u2019 his assistant and friend started but Tony didn\u2019t listen. Instead, he merely moved forward and grabbed his bags from the ground at Happy\u2019s feet before he walked ahead off the gravel to the steps to the front door. He moved quickly, desperate to get out of Happy\u2019s line of view, and was soon inside the door and resting against it.<br>\u00a0<br>He let his head fall back against the cold oak, his eyes falling shut as his breathing attempted to even itself out. Dumping his bags on the floor he opened his eyes and walked forward into the empty reception hall. His footsteps echoed throughout the empty house, a feeling that filled him with increasing sadness. As he walked lights flicked on throughout the house, responding to his movements.<br>\u00a0<br>As he went into the living room he noted that something was off. It wasn\u2019t pristine.

Tailored suits, crisp linen pants and rafts of jewellery were scattered around the room as they stopped fitting in the trash.&nbsp;</p><p>By the time he stopped the floor was covered in broken glass, clothes, papers and so much more. He continued hoping that this would get rid of all the hurt that was crushing him. He found his fathers&rsquo; study to be the most cathartic and for a vague moment, his mind was distracted. Room after room he blitzed until he hit the library.<br />&nbsp;<br />Maria&rsquo;s favourite place. As Tony entered a waft of her perfume hit his nose bringing with it another crushing wave of sadness. He moved into the room and to her favourite chair, where she&rsquo;d curl up at night whilst his father was working and read her favourite stories. There was still a half-drunk cup of tea on the table next to the chair as well as a picture. It was of her 15 years ago or so with a child Tony as they sat in that very room reading his favourite book. Howard had taken the picture after compromising with Maria that they would come down to the lab after they had finished as he wanted to show off his newest invention.<br />&nbsp;<br />The pain hit Tony like a truck. He had tried so hard to put it out of his mind but now he was forced to sit down on his mothers&rsquo; reading chair and try and compose himself. Whenever he had cried as a child Howard had scolded him, telling him that whenever he felt sad there was no reason to cry. A strong man, a real man, kept his composure and dealt with the problem. But that didn&rsquo;t matter now, they were gone. A fault, a stupid mechanical failure took away one of the most technically gifted minds ever. And his mother, an innocent bystander had gotten caught up in an accident that his father should have been prepared for! The tears started to spill over and he sat there, crying as he clutched the picture frame against his chest as if that would somehow reverse the damage that had evolved from the last couple of days.<br />&nbsp;<br />He didn&rsquo;t even notice the movement through the house and was only aware of a presence as a voice said from the door, &lsquo;Oh Tony.&rsquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />It was Peggy. She stood in the doorway wide-eyed looking down at Tony&rsquo;s broken form with sadness. Peggy had known for their family for years since Tony was a boy. She was his godmother but she was so much more than that, she was family. Though Maria had been adamantly involved in Tony&rsquo;s life, Howard had been somewhat vacant opting to work rather than a parent. Peggy had taken up some of the slack and raised him into the boy he was today.<br />&nbsp;<br />&lsquo;Aunty Peg,&rsquo; he said feeling his face grow cold as his tears started to stem. She moved forward into the room and knelt beside the chair, wiping his eyes.<br />&lsquo;I heard about everything, I came straight away.&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;They&rsquo;re gone-&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;I know. Tony dear, what happened to the house? My God.&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;I was upset.&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;Oh Tony,&rsquo; she whispered.<br />&nbsp;<br />Neither of them knew how long they had sat there, holding each other as tears spilt onto the soft cotton chair and the plush carpet beneath them. Eventually, Peggy patted Tony&rsquo;s leg and stood, smoothing out her skirt as she headed for the door.<br />&lsquo;Where are you going?&rsquo; he asked in a thick voice.<br />&lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to make some tea and tidy up. You&rsquo;re going to take a shower and meet me downstairs.&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;Peg-&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;No exceptions. You&rsquo;re angry I know but your parents don&rsquo;t deserve to have their house trashed.&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;They don&rsquo;t care, they&rsquo;re dead,&rsquo; Tony said bitterly.<br />&lsquo;All the more reason to show them a little respect. Once you&rsquo;re done you can put my suitcases in the guest bedroom, and call Happy. He&rsquo;s worried about you.&rsquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />With a flurry, she disappeared downstairs. Tony said nothing though part of him wanted to act out like a small child and tell her to get the hell out. She was right though he supposed. Sure, it was just stuff, materialistic things that didn&rsquo;t matter but it was theirs &ndash; their life made up of items, memorise. Rising from the chair he walked out of the room and down the hall, stripping his clothes as he went. Once he was in the bathroom he turned on the scalding hot shower and stepped under the steady stream of water allowing it to wash over his body. It was a small comfort. As the water washed down his face he was happy that he could cry without the embarrassment of another person knowing.</p>",
