It would be so much fun! The boys should come too.\u201d her friend tried to persuade (Y/N) sweetly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know Doe. Also, I don\u2019t think James likes me that much. I shouldn\u2019t come if he does. He teases me a lot.\u201d she toyed with her fingers while they were waiting for the baker to put the bread in a bag.</p><p>\u201cOh come on, don\u2019t be a whaky! He\u2019s head over heels, don\u2019t you see?\u201d Dorothy gently pushed the other girl. She has always been the \u201cwilder\u201d one of the two. (Y/N) was the sweet goody two shoes, while Dorothy was rather&hellip;daring. She basically didn\u2019t care what other people talked about her. She always said \u201cWhat does it matter? I\u2019m living my own life without bothering anyone. So why do they bother me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?- Thank you, sir.\u201d (Y/N) smiled and payed for the bread. </p><p>\u201cYes my darling. In fact, I overheard him talking to Charlie the other day, he was swooning over how cute you looked.\u201d Dorothy explained with a knowing smile, making (Y/N) blush and smile shyly in return. The two girls started walking home, when two guys came up to them, they were also from their friend group. </p><p>\u201cHi babe\u201d one of them threw his arm around Doe and pecked her on the cheek, but Dorothy scrunched up her face and pushed the boy away. </p><p>\u201cEw, get off me William!\u201d she exclaimed, wiping her cheek rather exaggerated. (Y/N) lightly giggled at that, because she knew that Dorothy was only playing. She knew that the girl had a huge crush on William and she also knew that they actually had something going on&hellip;.and off.  \u201cAnyways, we\u2019re hanging out tonight at our place on the hill. Don\u2019t come too late, sucker! And don\u2019t forget to bring the booze.\u201d she pushed the boy out of her way and grabbed (Y/N)\u2019s hand as they sassily walked away from the boys. </p><p>They arrived at (Y/N)\u2019s place and ran up to her room. Dorothy decided to make a plan on how to basically seduce James Barnes tonight. (Y/N) should talk to him in private and confess. \u201cStep one, is to look cute\u201d Dorothy said, so they started looking for a pretty outfit that (Y/N) could wear. \u201cYou should totally wear that cute skirt, the plaid one. With that shirt.\u201d Dorothy pointed over to the shirt she was talking about. </p><p>After (Y/N) changed clothes, the girls chatted a little longer before it was time to head out. Once they arrived at the hill, some of their friends were already waiting there. They greeted each other and talked a bit. When they thought it was dark enough, some guys and even girls, including Dorothy, started drinking bottles of alcohol.</p><p>(Y/N) looked over to James and felt the butterflies in her stomach go wild. She bit her lip to hide the smile. Dorothy, who saw her friend\u2019s look pushed the girl and nodded over to James. \u201cYou should talk to him\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cW-what? No! I can\u2019t. I changed my mind, I\u2019d rather swoon over him from afar.\u201d (Y/N) panicked as she looked back at the boy and gasped when she saw that his eyes were already on her. He smirked at the girl and winked, looking back at Steve, whom he was having a conversation with. (Y/N)\u2019s cheeks heated up in embarrassment and she looked down, when she felt Dorothy lightly push her teasingly.</p><p>\u201cOh my god he just totally winked at you. Go get him.\u201d Dorothy giggled, making (Y/N) chuckle too. After some time the friendgroup was more layed back, having fun together and some were already a little tipsy, when (Y/N) finally collected all her courage as she stood up and waltzed over to the tall boy with blue eyes. If it wasn\u2019t for Dorothy scolding her, she wouldn\u2019t have done what she was about to do. (Y/N)\u2019s heart was beating so fast and she was about to turn right back around, but Doe\u2019s encouraging words did something to her and she felt strong and somehow free. She was ready to do something dangerous and not think about what her father or mother would say. She was about to talk to James, alone. </p><p>But by the time (Y/N) stood infront of him, she felt small again. He drifted his eyes up at her and smirked. \u201cWell hello there.\u201d </p><p>\u201cH-hi. I-I have to talk to you&hellip;.alone.\u201d her last word made him smile even wider and he gave Steve a cheeky smirk over his shoulder. Steve only smiled shyly at (Y/N).</p><p>\u201cSure, where should we go to. Lead the way.\u201d he stood up and looked down at the girl. She took in a breath and walked further into the forest, but not too far, just to make sure the others wouldn\u2019t experience the rejection she was gonna face. </p><p>She turned around and faced James, she was blushing again when she watched him lean back against a tree. \u201cWhat is it, dollface? Did you bring me here to steal a honey cooler?\u201d her eyes widened. He grinned as he took her hands in his and pulled her closer to his body. \u201cWhy are you so shy now? Weren\u2019t we going to make out?\u201d she gasped again and looked anywhere but his eyes. She was suddenly trapped against the tree and his hard chest. James felt his heart swell at the look on her face. He actually knew that (Y/N) was way too shy to bring a boy into the woods to do something dirty. He was just teasing her, because he loved the way she always blushed. He wouldn\u2019t have minded it though, he had dreamt about kissing her plenty of times. And almost all of their friendgroup knew about his crush on you.</p><p>\u201cI actually- I was going to-\u201c she stammered with her fingers unconsciously clutching his jacket. She pressed her back against the tree, trying to make space between them, but he pressed himself further against her. Her breath hitched in her throat, when she felt his hands gripping her hips.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to be so shy, kitten. For hanging out with Doe you\u2019re very innocent, dare I say. Have you ever even kissed a boy?\u201d he asked and she could\u2019ve sworn that he moved his face closer. She gulped and shook her head. \u201cDo you want to?\u201d one of his hands was stil on her hip while the other one was cupping her cheek. \u201cDo you want me to kiss you?\u201d all worry and embarrassment was gone when (Y/N) slowly nodded and leaned into his touch. She closed her eyes while he moved closer to her to connect their lips. She gasped when she felt his lips on hers and pulled him closer by the collar of his jacket, making him chuckle. \u201cHave I found myself a greedy one?\u201d he cockily said after pulling away just a little only to be pulled back into the kiss. They continued making out for a while, till her arms were wrapped around his neck and his around her hips. There was no space left between them and (Y/N) was happy about that. She felt the fireworks in her stomach when she fluttered her eyes open to look at the boy as a reality check.</p><p>-</p><p>A few days passed after their first kiss and since then James and (Y/N) have been lowkey dating. He hadn\u2019t officially asked her to be his girlfriend, but every teenager in town knew that (Y/N) was James\u2019s girl. </p><p>When she told Doe what had happened the other night, Dorothy couldn\u2019t help but happily giggle and ask for details. </p><p>The girls were seated on a bench by the park and started making plans for future dates and how to get James to ask (Y/N) out when two boys sat down next to them, James Barnes and William. </p><p>William took Dorothy\u2019s hand in his, to place a kiss on her knuckles, making the girl cringe and roll her eyes in fake annoyence. \u201cWhat do you want, William.\u201d she scoffed, but the boy only pulled the girl from her seat, dragging her along with him. Doe only apologetically looked over her shoulder and walked with him. </p><p>(Y/N) drifted her eyes to James, who was seated right next to her with an amused look on his face. \u201cHow have you been, dolly.\u201d he smirked as he threw an arm over her shoulder. His face so close to hers, their lips almost touching.</p><p>\u201cYou just saw me yesterday.\u201d she laughed and looked away, thinking back to the time when Dorothy had told her to make him beg for her. She bit her lip, as she followed a bird with her eyes, waiting for him to do something when he finally spoke up. </p><p>\u201cAre you playing hard to get, because Doe told you it was a good idea to get my attention?\u201d he spoke with a smirk as he cupped her chin, turning her head to face him. \u201cBecause if so, we could just skip this and get to the good part you know? We don\u2019t have to wait. I mean we both like each other don\u2019t we? Let me take you out on a fine date. Be mine?\u201d he swiped his thumb over her bottom lip and leaned closer. (Y/N)\u2019s eyes widened, she felt overwhelmed at his sudden confession and question.</p><p>\u201cNot here James!\u201d (Y/N) shook her head and slightly pushed him away. \u201cYou should ask me privately and with a little more romance don\u2019t you think? This isn\u2019t how you ask a woman to be yours\u201c she gave him a teasing look, before getting up and walking away, mentally patting her own shoulder. She was yet again, feeling very strong. She wasn\u2019t expecting James to pull on her arm to hide between two shops. Her back was pressed against the brick wall. His breath was fanning against her face as she looked up at him with big doe eyes.</p><p>\u201cGo on a date with me tonight.\u201d he whispered against her lips, but she shook her head. He cupped her chin and kissed her messily, taking her breath away when she returned the kiss, he suddenly pulled away and repeated his question. \u201cGo on a date with me. Be mine.\u201d but (Y/N) just pulled him back again, throwing her arms around his shoulders and clinging onto his jacket. </p><p>-</p><p>When (Y/N) told Dorothy about what had happened, she freaked out. She literally demanded on choosing (Y/N)\u2019s outfit for her date. She even braided her hair prettily.</p><p>Finally dressed and ready (Y/N) waited for James to pick her up. She walked over to him when she saw him wait for her by the gates of her house. \u201cYou look stunning.\u201d he put his hand on her back and pulled her against his chest. His voice sounded genuine and soft, making her blush and look down. \u201cLet\u2019s go doll.\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>By the time the date ended James took (Y/N) to his home, making sure that she was allowed. (Y/N) had told her parents beforehand that she would be having a sleepover at Dorothy\u2019s, so that wasn\u2019t a problem.</p><p>\u201cMy parents are out of town, don\u2019t be surprised.\u201d he explained to her as they walked into the empty house. </p><p>\u201cThank you for tonight James.\u201d she smiled at him, while they were sitting on the big couch in the living room. </p><p>\u201cIt was nothing, doll. I\u2019m thankful you gave me an actual chance.\u201d he chuckled and his arm was yet again over her shoulder, but she didn\u2019t push him away. She felt more comfortable being this close, when they were alone. \u201cWill you let me kiss you now?\u201d he moved closer again and she giggled. </p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d she shyly looked down at his lips and waited for him to kiss her. And he did. While she eagerly kissed back she thought about how each time they kissed, it felt better and better. They kissed for a while before they ended up lying on the couch with him on top of her. \u201cAre we moving too fast?\u201d he asked her, pushing himself up with his arms. He looked down at her with shining eyes. The buttons of her shirt were unbottened and her collarbones were exposed, just like her her legs that were clothed in beige tights held up with cotton garters. Her hands moved to the hem of her skirt that was bundled up around her waist and she pulled it slightly down, in an attempt to hide her white cotton underpants. </p><p>\u201cJames I like you.\u201d she confessed with a red face and looked away from his eyes. He grabbed her face, making her look into his. </p><p>\u201cI like you too, doll. So I don\u2019t want to push you into anything you don\u2019t want to do.\u201d he explained, pecking her lips shortly. </p><p>\u201cHave you done this before? I mean have you been intimate with a girl?\u201d (Y/N) asked out of nervousness. Her heart was beating so fast, she felt it in her throat. </p><p>\u201cI have.\u201d he truthfully told her and looked at her face to see her reaction. But he wasn\u2019t prepared to see her bite her lip and look up at him with an erotic look in her eyes. </p><p>\u201cI want you to make me feel good, James. Treat me like you treated that girl.\u201d she let her skirt fall back around her waist her wrapped her arms around his neck. He gulped at the seriousness of the situation and leaned down to press his lips against hers. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to treat you better.\u201d he mumbled against her cheek, while he was pecking her skin. Finally on her neck he gently sucked, before kissing that place. He felt his dick twitch at her whining and heaving panting. \u201cHow far do you want to go, kitten?\u201d he asked as he pulled away again. He had to make sure, before he lost his self control. </p><p>\u201cJames I want to make love with you.\u201d she whined, pulling him back into a kiss. James just growled at that and continued kissing her messily. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you say we lose our clothes then, doll? Can I take off this shirt?\u201d he smirked again, when she nodded eagerly. The bottons were fully undone and the shirt thrown away over the couch. \u201cHow about this skirt?\u201d Slowly their clothes were thrown around in the room. </p><p>(Y/N) could feel his dick pressed against the back of her thigh as they kissed, with her legs parted for him. \u201cAre you sure about this, kitten? We can stop anytime.\u201d he reminded her with a sweet voice, but she shook her head. </p><p>\u201cPlease I want this.\u201d she whimpered. He nodded and took his cock in his hand, teasing her already wet lips with the head of if. A breathy moan left her lips, when he thrusted the tip in. \u201cGo deeper\u201d she whimpered at the stretch and he did. He started moving his hips back and forth, enjoying the wetness of her folds wrapped around his cock as he thrusted in and out. He closed his eyes as he started kissing her chest, listening to her pants and moans. </p><p>\u201cYou feel so good, kitten.\u201d he moaned and moved a little quicker. James grabbed her hands in his and placed them on each side of her head. He continued rolling his hips against hers when he felt her clench around him. </p><p>(Y/N) felt her a knot forming in her stomach and she spread her legs wider. She moaned against his lips and noticed her legs shaking. Suddenly she threw her head back and screeched while her whole body started shaking. \u201cJ-James.\u201d he whimpered and clawed his hair. </p><p>Not too long after he released his semen inside of her and pulled out right after. He moaned against her neck. Their bodies were still pressed against each other while they panted, calming down after their height. (Y/N) felt his cum spill and arched her back, pressing their chests together. </p><p>\u201cAm I yours now?\u201d she whisperd as they cuddled on the couch with her head on his chest. James was playing with her fingers, comparing hand sizes and intertwining their fingers. </p><p>\u201cI you want to be.\u201d he answered with a soft voice. </p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re mine too, then yes.\u201d</p>",

It would be so much fun! The boys should come too.\u201d her friend tried to persuade (Y/N) sweetly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know Doe. Also, I don\u2019t think James likes me that much. I shouldn\u2019t come if he does. He teases me a lot.\u201d she toyed with her fingers while they were waiting for the baker to put the bread in a bag.</p><p>\u201cOh come on, don\u2019t be a whaky! He\u2019s head over heels, don\u2019t you see?\u201d Dorothy gently pushed the other girl. She has always been the \u201cwilder\u201d one of the two. (Y/N) was the sweet goody two shoes, while Dorothy was rather\u2026daring. She basically didn\u2019t care what other people talked about her. She always said \u201cWhat does it matter? I\u2019m living my own life without bothering anyone. So why do they bother me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?- Thank you, sir.\u201d (Y/N) smiled and payed for the bread. </p><p>\u201cYes my darling.

She felt more comfortable being this close, when they were alone. \u201cWill you let me kiss you now?\u201d he moved closer again and she giggled. </p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d she shyly looked down at his lips and waited for him to kiss her. And he did. While she eagerly kissed back she thought about how each time they kissed, it felt better and better. They kissed for a while before they ended up lying on the couch with him on top of her. \u201cAre we moving too fast?\u201d he asked her, pushing himself up with his arms. He looked down at her with shining eyes. The buttons of her shirt were unbottened and her collarbones were exposed, just like her her legs that were clothed in beige tights held up with cotton garters. Her hands moved to the hem of her skirt that was bundled up around her waist and she pulled it slightly down, in an attempt to hide her white cotton underpants. </p><p>\u201cJames I like you.\u201d she confessed with a red face and looked away from his eyes. He grabbed her face, making her look into his. </p><p>\u201cI like you too, doll. So I don\u2019t want to push you into anything you don\u2019t want to do.\u201d he explained, pecking her lips shortly. </p><p>\u201cHave you done this before? I mean have you been intimate with a girl?\u201d (Y/N) asked out of nervousness. Her heart was beating so fast, she felt it in her throat. </p><p>\u201cI have.\u201d he truthfully told her and looked at her face to see her reaction. But he wasn\u2019t prepared to see her bite her lip and look up at him with an erotic look in her eyes. </p><p>\u201cI want you to make me feel good, James. Treat me like you treated that girl.\u201d she let her skirt fall back around her waist her wrapped her arms around his neck. He gulped at the seriousness of the situation and leaned down to press his lips against hers. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to treat you better.\u201d he mumbled against her cheek, while he was pecking her skin. Finally on her neck he gently sucked, before kissing that place. He felt his dick twitch at her whining and heaving panting. \u201cHow far do you want to go, kitten?\u201d he asked as he pulled away again. He had to make sure, before he lost his self control. </p><p>\u201cJames I want to make love with you.\u201d she whined, pulling him back into a kiss. James just growled at that and continued kissing her messily. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you say we lose our clothes then, doll? Can I take off this shirt?\u201d he smirked again, when she nodded eagerly. The bottons were fully undone and the shirt thrown away over the couch. \u201cHow about this skirt?\u201d Slowly their clothes were thrown around in the room. </p><p>(Y/N) could feel his dick pressed against the back of her thigh as they kissed, with her legs parted for him. \u201cAre you sure about this, kitten? We can stop anytime.\u201d he reminded her with a sweet voice, but she shook her head. </p><p>\u201cPlease I want this.\u201d she whimpered. He nodded and took his cock in his hand, teasing her already wet lips with the head of if. A breathy moan left her lips, when he thrusted the tip in. \u201cGo deeper\u201d she whimpered at the stretch and he did. He started moving his hips back and forth, enjoying the wetness of her folds wrapped around his cock as he thrusted in and out. He closed his eyes as he started kissing her chest, listening to her pants and moans. </p><p>\u201cYou feel so good, kitten.\u201d he moaned and moved a little quicker. James grabbed her hands in his and placed them on each side of her head. He continued rolling his hips against hers when he felt her clench around him. </p><p>(Y/N) felt her a knot forming in her stomach and she spread her legs wider. She moaned against his lips and noticed her legs shaking. Suddenly she threw her head back and screeched while her whole body started shaking. \u201cJ-James.\u201d he whimpered and clawed his hair. </p><p>Not too long after he released his semen inside of her and pulled out right after. He moaned against her neck. Their bodies were still pressed against each other while they panted, calming down after their height. (Y/N) felt his cum spill and arched her back, pressing their chests together. </p><p>\u201cAm I yours now?\u201d she whisperd as they cuddled on the couch with her head on his chest. James was playing with her fingers, comparing hand sizes and intertwining their fingers. </p><p>\u201cI you want to be.\u201d he answered with a soft voice. </p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re mine too, then yes.\u201d</p></p>",

I hope you like this short one shot about our bucky-boy\ud83e\udd8b</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"216\" data-orig-width=\"244\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"buckybass:TptGRpLAhmeyu2paGFvTfg:ZvG26h283gpb4\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/62bef616f5387113971a0397b0f4855c/tumblr_o8y6howlGw1vtjetwo1_250.gif\" data-orig-height=\"216\" data-orig-width=\"244\"></figure><p>It was the year 1938, (Y/N) was sent to the local bakery, where she met one of her girl friends Dorothy. \u201cWe should meet up again with the others, have a picnic on the hill, where you can see the pretty night sky. It would be so much fun! The boys should come too.\u201d her friend tried to persuade (Y/N) sweetly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know Doe. Also, I don\u2019t think James likes me that much. I shouldn\u2019t come if he does. He teases me a lot.\u201d she toyed with her fingers while they were waiting for the baker to put the bread in a bag.</p><p>\u201cOh come on, don\u2019t be a whaky! He\u2019s head over heels, don\u2019t you see?\u201d Dorothy gently pushed the other girl. She has always been the \u201cwilder\u201d one of the two. (Y/N) was the sweet goody two shoes, while Dorothy was rather\u2026daring. She basically didn\u2019t care what other people talked about her. She always said \u201cWhat does it matter? I\u2019m living my own life without bothering anyone. So why do they bother me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?- Thank you, sir.\u201d (Y/N) smiled and payed for the bread. </p><p>\u201cYes my darling. In fact, I overheard him talking to Charlie the other day, he was swooning over how cute you looked.\u201d Dorothy explained with a knowing smile, making (Y/N) blush and smile shyly in return. The two girls started walking home, when two guys came up to them, they were also from their friend group. </p><p>\u201cHi babe\u201d one of them threw his arm around Doe and pecked her on the cheek, but Dorothy scrunched up her face and pushed the boy away. </p><p>\u201cEw, get off me William!\u201d she exclaimed, wiping her cheek rather exaggerated. (Y/N) lightly giggled at that, because she knew that Dorothy was only playing. She knew that the girl had a huge crush on William and she also knew that they actually had something going on\u2026.and off.  \u201cAnyways, we\u2019re hanging out tonight at our place on the hill. Don\u2019t come too late, sucker! And don\u2019t forget to bring the booze.\u201d she pushed the boy out of her way and grabbed (Y/N)\u2019s hand as they sassily walked away from the boys. </p><p>They arrived at (Y/N)\u2019s place and ran up to her room. Dorothy decided to make a plan on how to basically seduce James Barnes tonight. (Y/N) should talk to him in private and confess. \u201cStep one, is to look cute\u201d Dorothy said, so they started looking for a pretty outfit that (Y/N) could wear. \u201cYou should totally wear that cute skirt, the plaid one. With that shirt.\u201d Dorothy pointed over to the shirt she was talking about. </p><p>After (Y/N) changed clothes, the girls chatted a little longer before it was time to head out. Once they arrived at the hill, some of their friends were already waiting there. They greeted each other and talked a bit. When they thought it was dark enough, some guys and even girls, including Dorothy, started drinking bottles of alcohol.</p><p>(Y/N) looked over to James and felt the butterflies in her stomach go wild. She bit her lip to hide the smile. Dorothy, who saw her friend\u2019s look pushed the girl and nodded over to James. \u201cYou should talk to him\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cW-what? No! I can\u2019t. I changed my mind, I\u2019d rather swoon over him from afar.\u201d (Y/N) panicked as she looked back at the boy and gasped when she saw that his eyes were already on her. He smirked at the girl and winked, looking back at Steve, whom he was having a conversation with. (Y/N)\u2019s cheeks heated up in embarrassment and she looked down, when she felt Dorothy lightly push her teasingly.</p><p>\u201cOh my god he just totally winked at you. Go get him.\u201d Dorothy giggled, making (Y/N) chuckle too. After some time the friendgroup was more layed back, having fun together and some were already a little tipsy, when (Y/N) finally collected all her courage as she stood up and waltzed over to the tall boy with blue eyes. If it wasn\u2019t for Dorothy scolding her, she wouldn\u2019t have done what she was about to do. (Y/N)\u2019s heart was beating so fast and she was about to turn right back around, but Doe\u2019s encouraging words did something to her and she felt strong and somehow free. She was ready to do something dangerous and not think about what her father or mother would say. She was about to talk to James, alone. </p><p>But by the time (Y/N) stood infront of him, she felt small again. He drifted his eyes up at her and smirked. \u201cWell hello there.\u201d </p><p>\u201cH-hi. I-I have to talk to you\u2026.alone.\u201d her last word made him smile even wider and he gave Steve a cheeky smirk over his shoulder. Steve only smiled shyly at (Y/N).</p><p>\u201cSure, where should we go to. Lead the way.\u201d he stood up and looked down at the girl. She took in a breath and walked further into the forest, but not too far, just to make sure the others wouldn\u2019t experience the rejection she was gonna face. </p><p>She turned around and faced James, she was blushing again when she watched him lean back against a tree. \u201cWhat is it, dollface? Did you bring me here to steal a honey cooler?\u201d her eyes widened. He grinned as he took her hands in his and pulled her closer to his body. \u201cWhy are you so shy now? Weren\u2019t we going to make out?\u201d she gasped again and looked anywhere but his eyes. She was suddenly trapped against the tree and his hard chest. James felt his heart swell at the look on her face. He actually knew that (Y/N) was way too shy to bring a boy into the woods to do something dirty. He was just teasing her, because he loved the way she always blushed. He wouldn\u2019t have minded it though, he had dreamt about kissing her plenty of times. And almost all of their friendgroup knew about his crush on you.</p><p>\u201cI actually- I was going to-\u201c she stammered with her fingers unconsciously clutching his jacket. She pressed her back against the tree, trying to make space between them, but he pressed himself further against her. Her breath hitched in her throat, when she felt his hands gripping her hips.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to be so shy, kitten. For hanging out with Doe you\u2019re very innocent, dare I say. Have you ever even kissed a boy?\u201d he asked and she could\u2019ve sworn that he moved his face closer. She gulped and shook her head. \u201cDo you want to?\u201d one of his hands was stil on her hip while the other one was cupping her cheek. \u201cDo you want me to kiss you?\u201d all worry and embarrassment was gone when (Y/N) slowly nodded and leaned into his touch. She closed her eyes while he moved closer to her to connect their lips. She gasped when she felt his lips on hers and pulled him closer by the collar of his jacket, making him chuckle. \u201cHave I found myself a greedy one?\u201d he cockily said after pulling away just a little only to be pulled back into the kiss. They continued making out for a while, till her arms were wrapped around his neck and his around her hips. There was no space left between them and (Y/N) was happy about that. She felt the fireworks in her stomach when she fluttered her eyes open to look at the boy as a reality check.</p><p>-</p><p>A few days passed after their first kiss and since then James and (Y/N) have been lowkey dating. He hadn\u2019t officially asked her to be his girlfriend, but every teenager in town knew that (Y/N) was James\u2019s girl. </p><p>When she told Doe what had happened the other night, Dorothy couldn\u2019t help but happily giggle and ask for details. </p><p>The girls were seated on a bench by the park and started making plans for future dates and how to get James to ask (Y/N) out when two boys sat down next to them, James Barnes and William. </p><p>William took Dorothy\u2019s hand in his, to place a kiss on her knuckles, making the girl cringe and roll her eyes in fake annoyence. \u201cWhat do you want, William.\u201d she scoffed, but the boy only pulled the girl from her seat, dragging her along with him. Doe only apologetically looked over her shoulder and walked with him. </p><p>(Y/N) drifted her eyes to James, who was seated right next to her with an amused look on his face. \u201cHow have you been, dolly.\u201d he smirked as he threw an arm over her shoulder. His face so close to hers, their lips almost touching.</p><p>\u201cYou just saw me yesterday.\u201d she laughed and looked away, thinking back to the time when Dorothy had told her to make him beg for her. She bit her lip, as she followed a bird with her eyes, waiting for him to do something when he finally spoke up. </p><p>\u201cAre you playing hard to get, because Doe told you it was a good idea to get my attention?\u201d he spoke with a smirk as he cupped her chin, turning her head to face him. \u201cBecause if so, we could just skip this and get to the good part you know? We don\u2019t have to wait. I mean we both like each other don\u2019t we? Let me take you out on a fine date. Be mine?\u201d he swiped his thumb over her bottom lip and leaned closer. (Y/N)\u2019s eyes widened, she felt overwhelmed at his sudden confession and question.</p><p>\u201cNot here James!\u201d (Y/N) shook her head and slightly pushed him away. \u201cYou should ask me privately and with a little more romance don\u2019t you think? This isn\u2019t how you ask a woman to be yours\u201c she gave him a teasing look, before getting up and walking away, mentally patting her own shoulder. She was yet again, feeling very strong. She wasn\u2019t expecting James to pull on her arm to hide between two shops. Her back was pressed against the brick wall. His breath was fanning against her face as she looked up at him with big doe eyes.</p><p>\u201cGo on a date with me tonight.\u201d he whispered against her lips, but she shook her head. He cupped her chin and kissed her messily, taking her breath away when she returned the kiss, he suddenly pulled away and repeated his question. \u201cGo on a date with me. Be mine.\u201d but (Y/N) just pulled him back again, throwing her arms around his shoulders and clinging onto his jacket. </p><p>-</p><p>When (Y/N) told Dorothy about what had happened, she freaked out. She literally demanded on choosing (Y/N)\u2019s outfit for her date. She even braided her hair prettily.</p><p>Finally dressed and ready (Y/N) waited for James to pick her up. She walked over to him when she saw him wait for her by the gates of her house. \u201cYou look stunning.\u201d he put his hand on her back and pulled her against his chest. His voice sounded genuine and soft, making her blush and look down. \u201cLet\u2019s go doll.\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>By the time the date ended James took (Y/N) to his home, making sure that she was allowed. (Y/N) had told her parents beforehand that she would be having a sleepover at Dorothy\u2019s, so that wasn\u2019t a problem.</p><p>\u201cMy parents are out of town, don\u2019t be surprised.\u201d he explained to her as they walked into the empty house. </p><p>\u201cThank you for tonight James.\u201d she smiled at him, while they were sitting on the big couch in the living room. </p><p>\u201cIt was nothing, doll. I\u2019m thankful you gave me an actual chance.\u201d he chuckled and his arm was yet again over her shoulder, but she didn\u2019t push him away. She felt more comfortable being this close, when they were alone. \u201cWill you let me kiss you now?\u201d he moved closer again and she giggled. </p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d she shyly looked down at his lips and waited for him to kiss her. And he did. While she eagerly kissed back she thought about how each time they kissed, it felt better and better. They kissed for a while before they ended up lying on the couch with him on top of her. \u201cAre we moving too fast?\u201d he asked her, pushing himself up with his arms. He looked down at her with shining eyes. The buttons of her shirt were unbottened and her collarbones were exposed, just like her her legs that were clothed in beige tights held up with cotton garters. Her hands moved to the hem of her skirt that was bundled up around her waist and she pulled it slightly down, in an attempt to hide her white cotton underpants. </p><p>\u201cJames I like you.\u201d she confessed with a red face and looked away from his eyes. He grabbed her face, making her look into his. </p><p>\u201cI like you too, doll. So I don\u2019t want to push you into anything you don\u2019t want to do.\u201d he explained, pecking her lips shortly. </p><p>\u201cHave you done this before? I mean have you been intimate with a girl?\u201d (Y/N) asked out of nervousness. Her heart was beating so fast, she felt it in her throat. </p><p>\u201cI have.\u201d he truthfully told her and looked at her face to see her reaction. But he wasn\u2019t prepared to see her bite her lip and look up at him with an erotic look in her eyes. </p><p>\u201cI want you to make me feel good, James. Treat me like you treated that girl.\u201d she let her skirt fall back around her waist her wrapped her arms around his neck. He gulped at the seriousness of the situation and leaned down to press his lips against hers. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to treat you better.\u201d he mumbled against her cheek, while he was pecking her skin. Finally on her neck he gently sucked, before kissing that place. He felt his dick twitch at her whining and heaving panting. \u201cHow far do you want to go, kitten?\u201d he asked as he pulled away again. He had to make sure, before he lost his self control. </p><p>\u201cJames I want to make love with you.\u201d she whined, pulling him back into a kiss. James just growled at that and continued kissing her messily. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you say we lose our clothes then, doll? Can I take off this shirt?\u201d he smirked again, when she nodded eagerly. The bottons were fully undone and the shirt thrown away over the couch. \u201cHow about this skirt?\u201d Slowly their clothes were thrown around in the room. </p><p>(Y/N) could feel his dick pressed against the back of her thigh as they kissed, with her legs parted for him. \u201cAre you sure about this, kitten? We can stop anytime.\u201d he reminded her with a sweet voice, but she shook her head. </p><p>\u201cPlease I want this.\u201d she whimpered. He nodded and took his cock in his hand, teasing her already wet lips with the head of if. A breathy moan left her lips, when he thrusted the tip in. \u201cGo deeper\u201d she whimpered at the stretch and he did. He started moving his hips back and forth, enjoying the wetness of her folds wrapped around his cock as he thrusted in and out. He closed his eyes as he started kissing her chest, listening to her pants and moans. </p><p>\u201cYou feel so good, kitten.\u201d he moaned and moved a little quicker. James grabbed her hands in his and placed them on each side of her head. He continued rolling his hips against hers when he felt her clench around him. </p><p>(Y/N) felt her a knot forming in her stomach and she spread her legs wider. She moaned against his lips and noticed her legs shaking. Suddenly she threw her head back and screeched while her whole body started shaking. \u201cJ-James.\u201d he whimpered and clawed his hair. </p><p>Not too long after he released his semen inside of her and pulled out right after. He moaned against her neck. Their bodies were still pressed against each other while they panted, calming down after their height. (Y/N) felt his cum spill and arched her back, pressing their chests together. </p><p>\u201cAm I yours now?\u201d she whisperd as they cuddled on the couch with her head on his chest. James was playing with her fingers, comparing hand sizes and intertwining their fingers. </p><p>\u201cI you want to be.\u201d he answered with a soft voice. </p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re mine too, then yes.\u201d</p></p>",

I hope you like this short one shot about our bucky-boy&#129419;</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>It was the year 1938, (Y/N) was sent to the local bakery, where she met one of her girl friends Dorothy. &ldquo;We should meet up again with the others, have a picnic on the hill, where you can see the pretty night sky. It would be so much fun! The boys should come too.&rdquo; her friend tried to persuade (Y/N) sweetly.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know Doe. Also, I don&rsquo;t think James likes me that much. I shouldn&rsquo;t come if he does. He teases me a lot.&rdquo; she toyed with her fingers while they were waiting for the baker to put the bread in a bag.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh come on, don&rsquo;t be a whaky! He&rsquo;s head over heels, don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo; Dorothy gently pushed the other girl. She has always been the &ldquo;wilder&rdquo; one of the two. (Y/N) was the sweet goody two shoes, while Dorothy was rather&hellip;daring. She basically didn&rsquo;t care what other people talked about her. She always said &ldquo;What does it matter? I&rsquo;m living my own life without bothering anyone. So why do they bother me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really?- Thank you, sir.&rdquo; (Y/N) smiled and payed for the bread. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes my darling. In fact, I overheard him talking to Charlie the other day, he was swooning over how cute you looked.&rdquo; Dorothy explained with a knowing smile, making (Y/N) blush and smile shyly in return. The two girls started walking home, when two guys came up to them, they were also from their friend group. </p><p>&ldquo;Hi babe&rdquo; one of them threw his arm around Doe and pecked her on the cheek, but Dorothy scrunched up her face and pushed the boy away. </p><p>&ldquo;Ew, get off me William!&rdquo; she exclaimed, wiping her cheek rather exaggerated. (Y/N) lightly giggled at that, because she knew that Dorothy was only playing. She knew that the girl had a huge crush on William and she also knew that they actually had something going on&hellip;.and off.  &ldquo;Anyways, we&rsquo;re hanging out tonight at our place on the hill. Don&rsquo;t come too late, sucker! And don&rsquo;t forget to bring the booze.&rdquo; she pushed the boy out of her way and grabbed (Y/N)&rsquo;s hand as they sassily walked away from the boys. </p><p>They arrived at (Y/N)&rsquo;s place and ran up to her room. Dorothy decided to make a plan on how to basically seduce James Barnes tonight. (Y/N) should talk to him in private and confess. &ldquo;Step one, is to look cute&rdquo; Dorothy said, so they started looking for a pretty outfit that (Y/N) could wear. &ldquo;You should totally wear that cute skirt, the plaid one. With that shirt.&rdquo; Dorothy pointed over to the shirt she was talking about. </p><p>After (Y/N) changed clothes, the girls chatted a little longer before it was time to head out. Once they arrived at the hill, some of their friends were already waiting there. They greeted each other and talked a bit. When they thought it was dark enough, some guys and even girls, including Dorothy, started drinking bottles of alcohol.</p><p>(Y/N) looked over to James and felt the butterflies in her stomach go wild. She bit her lip to hide the smile. Dorothy, who saw her friend&rsquo;s look pushed the girl and nodded over to James. &ldquo;You should talk to him&rdquo; she whispered.</p><p>&ldquo;W-what? No! I can&rsquo;t. I changed my mind, I&rsquo;d rather swoon over him from afar.&rdquo; (Y/N) panicked as she looked back at the boy and gasped when she saw that his eyes were already on her. He smirked at the girl and winked, looking back at Steve, whom he was having a conversation with. (Y/N)&rsquo;s cheeks heated up in embarrassment and she looked down, when she felt Dorothy lightly push her teasingly.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god he just totally winked at you. Go get him.&rdquo; Dorothy giggled, making (Y/N) chuckle too. After some time the friendgroup was more layed back, having fun together and some were already a little tipsy, when (Y/N) finally collected all her courage as she stood up and waltzed over to the tall boy with blue eyes. If it wasn&rsquo;t for Dorothy scolding her, she wouldn&rsquo;t have done what she was about to do. (Y/N)&rsquo;s heart was beating so fast and she was about to turn right back around, but Doe&rsquo;s encouraging words did something to her and she felt strong and somehow free. She was ready to do something dangerous and not think about what her father or mother would say. She was about to talk to James, alone. </p><p>But by the time (Y/N) stood infront of him, she felt small again. He drifted his eyes up at her and smirked. &ldquo;Well hello there.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;H-hi. I-I have to talk to you&hellip;.alone.&rdquo; her last word made him smile even wider and he gave Steve a cheeky smirk over his shoulder. Steve only smiled shyly at (Y/N).</p><p>&ldquo;Sure, where should we go to. Lead the way.&rdquo; he stood up and looked down at the girl. She took in a breath and walked further into the forest, but not too far, just to make sure the others wouldn&rsquo;t experience the rejection she was gonna face. </p><p>She turned around and faced James, she was blushing again when she watched him lean back against a tree. &ldquo;What is it, dollface? Did you bring me here to steal a honey cooler?&rdquo; her eyes widened. He grinned as he took her hands in his and pulled her closer to his body. &ldquo;Why are you so shy now? Weren&rsquo;t we going to make out?&rdquo; she gasped again and looked anywhere but his eyes. She was suddenly trapped against the tree and his hard chest. James felt his heart swell at the look on her face. He actually knew that (Y/N) was way too shy to bring a boy into the woods to do something dirty. He was just teasing her, because he loved the way she always blushed. He wouldn&rsquo;t have minded it though, he had dreamt about kissing her plenty of times. And almost all of their friendgroup knew about his crush on you.</p><p>&ldquo;I actually- I was going to-&ldquo; she stammered with her fingers unconsciously clutching his jacket. She pressed her back against the tree, trying to make space between them, but he pressed himself further against her. Her breath hitched in her throat, when she felt his hands gripping her hips.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect you to be so shy, kitten. For hanging out with Doe you&rsquo;re very innocent, dare I say. Have you ever even kissed a boy?&rdquo; he asked and she could&rsquo;ve sworn that he moved his face closer. She gulped and shook her head. &ldquo;Do you want to?&rdquo; one of his hands was stil on her hip while the other one was cupping her cheek. &ldquo;Do you want me to kiss you?&rdquo; all worry and embarrassment was gone when (Y/N) slowly nodded and leaned into his touch. She closed her eyes while he moved closer to her to connect their lips. She gasped when she felt his lips on hers and pulled him closer by the collar of his jacket, making him chuckle. &ldquo;Have I found myself a greedy one?&rdquo; he cockily said after pulling away just a little only to be pulled back into the kiss. They continued making out for a while, till her arms were wrapped around his neck and his around her hips. There was no space left between them and (Y/N) was happy about that. She felt the fireworks in her stomach when she fluttered her eyes open to look at the boy as a reality check.</p><p>-</p><p>A few days passed after their first kiss and since then James and (Y/N) have been lowkey dating. He hadn&rsquo;t officially asked her to be his girlfriend, but every teenager in town knew that (Y/N) was James&rsquo;s girl. </p><p>When she told Doe what had happened the other night, Dorothy couldn&rsquo;t help but happily giggle and ask for details. </p><p>The girls were seated on a bench by the park and started making plans for future dates and how to get James to ask (Y/N) out when two boys sat down next to them, James Barnes and William. </p><p>William took Dorothy&rsquo;s hand in his, to place a kiss on her knuckles, making the girl cringe and roll her eyes in fake annoyence. &ldquo;What do you want, William.&rdquo; she scoffed, but the boy only pulled the girl from her seat, dragging her along with him. Doe only apologetically looked over her shoulder and walked with him. </p><p>(Y/N) drifted her eyes to James, who was seated right next to her with an amused look on his face. &ldquo;How have you been, dolly.&rdquo; he smirked as he threw an arm over her shoulder. His face so close to hers, their lips almost touching.</p><p>&ldquo;You just saw me yesterday.&rdquo; she laughed and looked away, thinking back to the time when Dorothy had told her to make him beg for her. She bit her lip, as she followed a bird with her eyes, waiting for him to do something when he finally spoke up. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you playing hard to get, because Doe told you it was a good idea to get my attention?&rdquo; he spoke with a smirk as he cupped her chin, turning her head to face him. &ldquo;Because if so, we could just skip this and get to the good part you know? We don&rsquo;t have to wait. I mean we both like each other don&rsquo;t we? Let me take you out on a fine date. Be mine?&rdquo; he swiped his thumb over her bottom lip and leaned closer. (Y/N)&rsquo;s eyes widened, she felt overwhelmed at his sudden confession and question.</p><p>&ldquo;Not here James!&rdquo; (Y/N) shook her head and slightly pushed him away. &ldquo;You should ask me privately and with a little more romance don&rsquo;t you think? This isn&rsquo;t how you ask a woman to be yours&ldquo; she gave him a teasing look, before getting up and walking away, mentally patting her own shoulder. She was yet again, feeling very strong. She wasn&rsquo;t expecting James to pull on her arm to hide between two shops. Her back was pressed against the brick wall. His breath was fanning against her face as she looked up at him with big doe eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Go on a date with me tonight.&rdquo; he whispered against her lips, but she shook her head. He cupped her chin and kissed her messily, taking her breath away when she returned the kiss, he suddenly pulled away and repeated his question. &ldquo;Go on a date with me. Be mine.&rdquo; but (Y/N) just pulled him back again, throwing her arms around his shoulders and clinging onto his jacket. </p><p>-</p><p>When (Y/N) told Dorothy about what had happened, she freaked out. She literally demanded on choosing (Y/N)&rsquo;s outfit for her date. She even braided her hair prettily.</p><p>Finally dressed and ready (Y/N) waited for James to pick her up. She walked over to him when she saw him wait for her by the gates of her house. &ldquo;You look stunning.&rdquo; he put his hand on her back and pulled her against his chest. His voice sounded genuine and soft, making her blush and look down. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go doll.&rdquo;</p><p>-</p><p>By the time the date ended James took (Y/N) to his home, making sure that she was allowed. (Y/N) had told her parents beforehand that she would be having a sleepover at Dorothy&rsquo;s, so that wasn&rsquo;t a problem.</p><p>&ldquo;My parents are out of town, don&rsquo;t be surprised.&rdquo; he explained to her as they walked into the empty house. </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you for tonight James.&rdquo; she smiled at him, while they were sitting on the big couch in the living room. </p><p>&ldquo;It was nothing, doll. I&rsquo;m thankful you gave me an actual chance.&rdquo; he chuckled and his arm was yet again over her shoulder, but she didn&rsquo;t push him away. She felt more comfortable being this close, when they were alone. &ldquo;Will you let me kiss you now?&rdquo; he moved closer again and she giggled. </p><p>&ldquo;I guess.&rdquo; she shyly looked down at his lips and waited for him to kiss her. And he did. While she eagerly kissed back she thought about how each time they kissed, it felt better and better. They kissed for a while before they ended up lying on the couch with him on top of her. &ldquo;Are we moving too fast?&rdquo; he asked her, pushing himself up with his arms. He looked down at her with shining eyes. The buttons of her shirt were unbottened and her collarbones were exposed, just like her her legs that were clothed in beige tights held up with cotton garters. Her hands moved to the hem of her skirt that was bundled up around her waist and she pulled it slightly down, in an attempt to hide her white cotton underpants. </p><p>&ldquo;James I like you.&rdquo; she confessed with a red face and looked away from his eyes. He grabbed her face, making her look into his. </p><p>&ldquo;I like you too, doll. So I don&rsquo;t want to push you into anything you don&rsquo;t want to do.&rdquo; he explained, pecking her lips shortly. </p><p>&ldquo;Have you done this before? I mean have you been intimate with a girl?&rdquo; (Y/N) asked out of nervousness. Her heart was beating so fast, she felt it in her throat. </p><p>&ldquo;I have.&rdquo; he truthfully told her and looked at her face to see her reaction. But he wasn&rsquo;t prepared to see her bite her lip and look up at him with an erotic look in her eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;I want you to make me feel good, James. Treat me like you treated that girl.&rdquo; she let her skirt fall back around her waist her wrapped her arms around his neck. He gulped at the seriousness of the situation and leaned down to press his lips against hers. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to treat you better.&rdquo; he mumbled against her cheek, while he was pecking her skin. Finally on her neck he gently sucked, before kissing that place. He felt his dick twitch at her whining and heaving panting. &ldquo;How far do you want to go, kitten?&rdquo; he asked as he pulled away again. He had to make sure, before he lost his self control. </p><p>&ldquo;James I want to make love with you.&rdquo; she whined, pulling him back into a kiss. James just growled at that and continued kissing her messily. </p><p>&ldquo;What do you say we lose our clothes then, doll? Can I take off this shirt?&rdquo; he smirked again, when she nodded eagerly. The bottons were fully undone and the shirt thrown away over the couch. &ldquo;How about this skirt?&rdquo; Slowly their clothes were thrown around in the room. </p><p>(Y/N) could feel his dick pressed against the back of her thigh as they kissed, with her legs parted for him. &ldquo;Are you sure about this, kitten? We can stop anytime.&rdquo; he reminded her with a sweet voice, but she shook her head. </p><p>&ldquo;Please I want this.&rdquo; she whimpered. He nodded and took his cock in his hand, teasing her already wet lips with the head of if. A breathy moan left her lips, when he thrusted the tip in. &ldquo;Go deeper&rdquo; she whimpered at the stretch and he did. He started moving his hips back and forth, enjoying the wetness of her folds wrapped around his cock as he thrusted in and out. He closed his eyes as he started kissing her chest, listening to her pants and moans. </p><p>&ldquo;You feel so good, kitten.&rdquo; he moaned and moved a little quicker. James grabbed her hands in his and placed them on each side of her head. He continued rolling his hips against hers when he felt her clench around him. </p><p>(Y/N) felt her a knot forming in her stomach and she spread her legs wider. She moaned against his lips and noticed her legs shaking. Suddenly she threw her head back and screeched while her whole body started shaking. &ldquo;J-James.&rdquo; he whimpered and clawed his hair. </p><p>Not too long after he released his semen inside of her and pulled out right after. He moaned against her neck. Their bodies were still pressed against each other while they panted, calming down after their height. (Y/N) felt his cum spill and arched her back, pressing their chests together. </p><p>&ldquo;Am I yours now?&rdquo; she whisperd as they cuddled on the couch with her head on his chest. James was playing with her fingers, comparing hand sizes and intertwining their fingers. </p><p>&ldquo;I you want to be.&rdquo; he answered with a soft voice. </p><p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re mine too, then yes.&rdquo;</p></p>",
