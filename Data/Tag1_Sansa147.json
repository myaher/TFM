        "answer": "<p>Hey, nonnie!</p><p>Hmmm \u2026 very interesting question. And a multi-layered one.\u00a0</p><p>Of course the show will have to pay-off the prophecies it included from the books. Then there are prophecies that were not mentioned in the show but by the nature of revealing the endgame and by being ahead of the books, the show will either pay them off or at least give heavy hints for what they might be in the books. And then there are foreshadowing elements that aren\u2019t really prophecies per se but serve a similar purpose in the narrative.\u00a0</p><p>So let\u2019s get started. Warning: this will get long.\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p><b>Prophecies mentioned in the show</b></p><p><b>Azor Ahai</b></p><blockquote><p>Melisandre: After the long summer, the darkness will fall heavy on the world. Stars will bleed. The cold breath of winter will freeze the seas and the Dead shall rise in the North. In the ancient books it\u2019s written that a warrior shall draw a burning sword from the fire and that sword shall be Lightbringer.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>This is very much in play, having been mentioned as recently as season 7 and I believe that by the end of season 8 we will have a definitive answer as to who and what Azor Ahai is.\u00a0</p><p>I\u2019ve talked about this before in this <a href=\"https://fortunatelylori.tumblr.com/post/182112197071/do-you-subscribe-to-the-theory-that-jamie-is-the\">post</a>. Here is an excerpt:\u00a0</p><p><i>I think it\u2019s far more likely that Azor Ahai is not a hero. He\u2019s a villain and the elemental opposite to the Night King. \u00a0R'hllor followers herald Azor Ahai\u2019s second coming with such encouraging words as: \u201c he will bring an eternal summer\u201d which sounds great if you worship fire but in reality an eternal summer is about as bad as an eternal winter. If the WWs unbalance the world by plunging it into night and winter, Azor Ahai is supposed not to bring balance back but to unbalance it in the opposite direction. </i></p><p><i>Considering the placement of Azor Ahai in complete opposition to the WW and the obsession with fire of the followers of R\u2019hllor, I\u2019d say that the best candidate for this position is one D*enerys Targareyen, which doesn\u2019t sound surprising since many people theorize the same. The twist is that AA was never meant to be a hero but rather an antagonist. <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3sVGPVR6Ra7mnliy4eLYPg\">@trinuviel</a> has <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/168087267884/azor-ahai-the-prince-that-was-promised-and-the\">a fantastic series</a> regarding this topic and I would encourage you to read it. She goes into a lot more detail than I am able to provide. </i></p><p>One aspect of this prophecy that is not brought up in the show is Nissa Nissa:\u00a0</p><p><i>To fight the darkness, Azor Ahai needed to forge a hero\u2019s sword. He labored for thirty days and thirty nights until it was done. However, when he went to temper it in water, the sword broke. He was not one to give up easily, so he started over.</i></p><p><i>The second time he took fifty days and fifty nights to make the sword, even better than the first. To temper it this time, he captured a lion and drove the sword into its heart, but once more the steel shattered.</i></p><p><i>The third time, with a heavy heart, for he knew beforehand what he must do to finish the blade, he worked for a hundred days and nights until it was finished. This time, he called for his wife, Nissa<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fawoiaf.westeros.org%2Findex.php%2FNissa_Nissa&amp;t=NjZhZTA1OTM1ZGI4MzliZTk2YzJkMDk5NTRjNjE2NGMyY2ZhMGE2MSxSdVpDcnl4ZA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Ayx6zQsV7n9nxh5cxFinRIg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ffortunatelylori.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F182112197071%2Fdo-you-subscribe-to-the-theory-that-jamie-is-the&amp;m=1\" title=\"Nissa Nissa\"> </a>Nissa, and asked her to bare her breast. He drove his sword into her living heart, her soul combining with the steel of the sword, creating Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes.</i></p><p>People have been speculating for years on who might be the Nissa Nissa in the story but because this isn\u2019t mentioned in the show, I\u2019m not really sure this will be paid off. However, considering Melisandre\u2019s obsession with blood magic and human sacrifice, I think there\u2019s a possibility that a candidate will arise. And in my opinion, that would probably be Mel herself. She foretold her own death in season 7 and because of the nature of her arc, the relation to fire, blood and magic I can see her as a willing human sacrifice for the glory of the prophesied hero.\u00a0</p><p>However, since I don\u2019t think she is interpreting the prophecy of Azor Ahai correctly and that AA is probably not the person that will end the Long Night, I don\u2019t think this human sacrifice in the form of Nissa Nissa 2.0 will have an effect or at least not the desired one.\u00a0</p><p>In the comments section of the post I linked above, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3sVGPVR6Ra7mnliy4eLYPg\">@trinuviel</a> brought forth the idea that the story of Nissa Nissa and Lightbringer is a metaphorical set of instructions on how to forge Valyrian steel. And I have to say that\u2019s a very intriguing idea and one that sounds very plausible to me for several reasons:\u00a0</p><p>1. Valyrian steel swords are already magical swords and we know they are effective against the WWs. What could a burning sword do that these other swords can\u2019t?</p><p>2. The Valyrians were known to practice blood magic and it\u2019s theorized that\u2019s where the source of most of their power came from, including their bond with dragons.\u00a0</p><p>3. GRRM has purposefully pointed to the mystery surrounding the forging of Valyrian steel in story several times. There must be a pretty big reason why he hasn\u2019t revealed how these swords are forged.\u00a0</p><p><b>The Younger More Beautiful Queen</b></p><blockquote><p>Maggy the Frog: Oh, yes! You\u2019ll be queen \u2026 For a time. Then comes another. Younger. More beautiful. To cast you down and take all you hold dear.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>I believe the last time Cersei mentioned her encounter with Maggy the Frog was after Myrcella was killed. So this will be paid off in season 8.</p><p>I\u2019ve made the argument in the past that Sansa is the younger, more beautiful queen that will cast Cersei down and take all that she holds dear:\u00a0</p><p><i>Sansa has been intimately involved in all of Cersei\u2019s tragedies even though she is not directly responsible. She was the one that carried the poison that killed Jofferey, the war with her brother is the reason why Myrcella was sent to Dorne, Jofferey\u2019s death leads to Tommen becoming king and eventually killing himself. And, by the end of this series, Sansa might end up as queen of the Seven Kingdoms effectively replacing Cersei. </i></p><p><i>It isn\u2019t that Sansa is directly responsible for what happens to Cersei but that she ends up taking everything from her in a way that no one could have predicted unless you look back at the events.\u00a0</i></p><p>There is an aspect of this prophecy that isn\u2019t mentioned but I think will be paid off as well:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\nAnd when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you.\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>I honestly have no idea why they chose not to include this in the show since it\u2019s part of the same conversation as the younger, more beautiful queen. They might bring it up in season 8 through another flash-back and I think that they should. Either way, I\u2019m pretty sure we will find out who the valonqar is.\u00a0</p><p>I\u2019ve made an argument for Jaime because I think it will be a fitting end to their story and because of what Cersei told Ned about her and Jaime back in season 1:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Cersei: Jaime and I are more than brother and sister. We shared a womb. We came into this world together. We belong together.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>And by that logic \u2026 they will die together. Or at least one will be the end to the other.\u00a0</p><p><b>The Prince that was Promised</b></p><blockquote><p>Melisandre: You should kneel before your brother. He\u2019s the lord\u2019s chosen. Born amidst salt and smoke.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>This is a dicey one because it\u2019s only brought up by Mel as an interchangeable title for Azor Ahai.\u00a0</p><p>In the books, however, the PTWP is also brought up in relation to Rhaegar and his prophecy fulfilling quest. When D*ny visits the House of the Undying, she has a vision of her brother holding his infant son, Aegon, by Elia Martell and saying this:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Rhaegar: <a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aegon_Targaryen_(son_of_Rhaegar)\" title=\"Aegon Targaryen (son of Rhaegar)\">Aegon</a>. What better name for a king?<br/></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Elia: Will you make a song for him?<br/></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Rhaegar:<b>\u00a0</b>He has a song. He is the prince that was promised, and his is the song of ice and fire.</p></blockquote><p>From what we know at this time, Rhaegar never brings up the Azor Ahai prophecy and we don\u2019t know that much about the PTWP. But I tend to think these two aren\u2019t related.\u00a0</p><p>I believe the PTWP is Jon. His is the only story that is linked to both fire and ice. He is the literal product of the song of ice and fire (the son of a Targareyen and a Stark) and his story is connected to both ice and fire through out. He fights against Ice in the form of the White Walkers and he encounters both the false Azor Ahai (Stannis) and now D*ny, who is the person associated the most with fire in the series. If the Dance of Dragons 2.0 and dark D*ny theories become canon, his song of ice and fire would be his titular role in both these great wars that are about to visit Westeros. He also has\u00a0\u201csalt and smoke\u201d imagery associated with his death (and subsequent resurrection).\u00a0</p><p>So I tend to see the PTWP and AA as actually being ultimate adversaries.\u00a0</p><p>What I\u2019m doubting at the moment is whether or not the show will bother differentiating between these two. I do think that by confirming Dark D*ny and the Dance of Dragons 2.0, they will essentially pay off this prophecy but I\u2019m not sure they\u2019ll signal the distinction.\u00a0</p><p>That\u2019s about it on the show-included prophecies, I think.</p><p><b>Prophecies not mentioned in the show</b></p><p><b>The Last Hero</b></p><blockquote><p>\n\nLegends of the north state the last hero and his companions went in search of the children of the forest during the Long Night, thousands of years ago. The only survivor of the company after attacks from giants, wights, and Others, the last hero eventually reached the children and gained their assistance. The Night\u2019s Watch then formed and won the Battle for the Dawn. This ended the generation-long winter and sent the Others into retreat, possibly to the Land of Always Winter. The fate of the last hero is unknown\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>One could make an argument that this is not a prophecy but rather a story but because the Battle for the Dawn 2.0 is fast approaching, this story/prophecy will most likely be paid off in season 8.\u00a0</p><p>\n\nIf anyone is destined to be the hero to save the world from the Long Night that character is Bran Stark and his story is linked to the legend of the Last Hero, who is also identified as Bran the Builder. This connection is not fully established yet but I believe the characters of the Last Hero and Bran the Builder to be one and the same.\u00a0</p><p>Bran is the Three Eyed Raven, he\u2019s traveled to the Lands of Always Winter and reached the children of the forest. That\u2019s enough evidence for me to assume that his role in season 8 and the defeat of the WWs will pay off the Legend of the Last Hero. Incidentally, Bran the Builder is mentioned in relation to our Bran by Maester Luwin in season 1.\u00a0<br/></p><p>We might also get a pay off for how the Wall and Winterfell were actually built although I do think part of this story will remain a mystery that will most likely be tackled in the Long Night prequel.\u00a0</p><p><b>D*ny\u2019s prophecies in the House of the Undying</b></p><blockquote><p>\u2026 mother of dragons, daughter of death \u2026 <br/></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u2026 mother of dragons, slayer of lies \u2026 <br/></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u2026 mother of dragons, bride of fire \u2026 </p></blockquote><p>\n\nEssentially, I believe all of these will be paid off by the Dark D*ny reveal. \n\n<br/></p><blockquote><p>\n\nthree fires must you light\u2026 one for life and one for death and one to love\u2026 three mounts must you ride\u2026 one to bed and one to dread and one to love\u2026 three treasons will you know\u2026 once for blood and once for gold and once for love\u2026\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>I think it was a huge mistake for the show not to include the 3 treasons prophecy in D*ny\u2019s storyline, particularly since they included Cersei\u2019s Younger More Beautiful Queen one. Because the three treasons prophecy works on D*ny\u2019s psyche much in the same way it does on Cersei\u2019s.\u00a0</p><p>They both become increasingly paranoid and obsessed with these ominous predictions and are actively on the look-out for potential candidates.\u00a0</p><p>However I think the pol!jon reveal will resolve the 3rd treason aspect of the prophecy as well as this:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\nA blue flower growing from a chink in a wall of ice, filling the air with sweetness.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A great stone beast takes wing from a smoking tower, breathing shadows.</p></blockquote><p>Between the parentage reveal and Political Jon, her lover turned nephew, Jon Snow, will turn from the flower that fills the air with sweetness into the great stone beast that will oppose her.</p><p>There\u2019s also a case to be made that the three treasons are actually treasons D*ny commits against other people, as <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m61FcucyaOKFkj0gFLKRgJA\">@thelawyerthatwaspromised</a> has detailed on her blog. And by going to war with Jon and potentially turning her back on the fight with the WWs, D*ny would essentially become a betrayer.\u00a0</p><p>So either way, I think we\u2019ll have a much clearer picture of these prophecies by the end of the show.\u00a0</p><p><b>The dragon must have three heads</b></p><p>This is the continuation of the Rhaegar vision D*ny sees in the House of the Undying.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Rhaegar:\u00a0\n\nHe has a song. He is the prince that was promised, and his is the song of ice and fire. <b>There must be one more. The dragon has three heads.\n\n</b></p></blockquote><p>We don\u2019t know much of anything about what this means or how Rhaegar thought it would link to the PTWP prophecy. I wouldn\u2019t have included it, to be honest, if it wasn\u2019t for the Crypts of Winterfell teaser and the staging of Jon/Arya/Sansa as a play on the original three heads of the dragon Aegon/Visenya/Rhaenys. In a previous <a href=\"https://fortunatelylori.tumblr.com/post/182374969101/hi-im-a-huge-jonsa-fan-and-im-against-a-targ\">post</a> I said this:\u00a0</p><p><i>\n\nThe \u201cDragon must have 3 heads\u201d is generally considered the reason why Rhaegar started his relationship with Lyanna and the main reason why Jon was even born. Details on this prophecy are foggy but the theory goes that at some point Rhaegar became convinced that his three children would be instrumental in saving the world and because Elia Martell was unable to bare another child after her two pregnancies, he went after teenage Lyanna Stark, thus looking to fulfill yet another prophecy: that of the Prince that was Promised whose song is the song of ice and fire. \n\n</i><br/></p><p><i>In trying to fulfill it, Rhaegar named his children after the 3 original Targs that conquered Westeros: Elia gave him an Aegon and a Rhaenys so he went in search of his Visenya. Clearly he failed, because instead of a girl, he got a boy. </i></p><p><i>However, as GRRM points out through out his story, prophecies are tricky and the more you go out of your way to fulfill them, the more blunders you\u2019re bound to commit. That doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t some value to it but it will most likely come to pass in a way that you did not expect. </i></p><p><i>It makes you wonder just what the \u201c3 heads of the dragon\u201d might actually be about. Everyone tends to think that this prophecy is linked to the war with the WWs. However, by introducing Sansa into the mix, it changes things a bit \u2026\n\n<br/></i></p><p><i>What if the \u201cDragon must have 3 heads\u201d prophecy isn\u2019t related to the War of the Dawn at all but rather to the Dance of Dragons 2.0? Because in that war, Sansa would truly be instrumental: by making Jon a Stark, because of her political expertise and her strategic connections all over Westeros. So instead of creating the ultimate Targ team to face off against the apocalypse, Rhaegar not only brought down his father\u2019s dynasty and his own in Robert\u2019s rebellion but also created the circumstances by which, years later, his son would face off against the last scion of House Targareyen and bring about the demise of all living dragons.\n\n</i><br/></p><p>While this could simply remain something that will be inferred by the way season 8 plays out, I think there\u2019s a case to be made that we will actually get more insight here via flash-backs of Rhaegar/Lyanna.\u00a0</p><p>I think it\u2019s also possible that through these flashbacks we will find out more about the situation surrounding the abduction of Lyanna, more insight into the year they spent in the Tower of Joy and even perhaps the name that Rhaegar whispered as he lay dying on the Trident.\u00a0</p><p><b>The Lannister gold prophecy</b></p><blockquote><p>\n\nThe wealth of the westerlands was matched, in ancient times, with the hunger of the Freehold of Valyria for precious metals, yet there seems no evidence that the dragonlords ever made contact with the lords of the Rock, Casterly or Lannister. Septon Barth speculated on the matter, referring to a Valyrian text that has since been lost, suggesting that the Freehold\u2019s sorcerers foretold that the gold of Casterly Rock would destroy them.\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>This is a very obscure prophecy and I haven\u2019t seen many people discuss it. The few that I have seen talk about this link it to the Lannister\u2019s long lost Valyrian steel sword, Brightroar. The Valyrians, fearing this prophecy Septon Barth mentions, always refused to sell the Lannisters a sword but they managed to get their hands on one by other means:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\nBrightroar came into the possession of the Lannister kings in the century before the Doom of Valyria, and it is said that the weight of gold they paid for it would have been enough to raise an army.\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>So people speculate that it was the purchasing of this sword that lead up to the Doom of Valyria.\u00a0However, I don\u2019t really see this as a possibility because GRRM never really plays prophecies this straight.\u00a0</p><p>However, one thing we do know is going to happen in season 8 is that Cersei will be acquiring the Golden Company, whose banner is simple golden cloth. She will also be paying for it with what can be described as Lannister gold.\u00a0</p><p>Also since the show didn\u2019t include the Young Griff story line, it\u2019s not outside the realm of possibility that the GC is leaded by Jon Connington, one of Rhaegar\u2019s best buddies and also the guy who was in love with him.\u00a0</p><p>So if let\u2019s say the GC would decide to join Jon\u2019s forces against D*ny during the Dance of Dragons, a case can be made that Lannister Gold did in fact bring about the ultimate doom of Valyria, by killing off its last real member and putting an end to the dragons.\u00a0</p><p>Then there are a few prophecies that I believe have already been paid off.\u00a0</p><p><b>The mummer\u2019s dragon</b></p><blockquote><p>A cloth dragon sways on poles amidst a cheering crowd.</p></blockquote><p>By essentially removing the Young Griff from the story line completely, I think the show has revealed that this young man is not Aegon Targareyen but a pretender whose lie, and life, D*ny will slay in the books.\u00a0</p><p><b>The girl in grey prophecy</b></p><blockquote><p>\n\nI have seen your sister in my fires, fleeing from this marriage they have made for her. Coming here, to you. A girl in grey on a dying horse, I have seen it plain as day. It has not happened yet, but it will.\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>I think everyone in the Jonsa fandom can agree that the girl in grey is in effect Sansa Stark and she will flee her marriage to Harry Hardyng and join Jon at the wall.\u00a0</p><p>The show had Sansa fleeing her marriage to Ramsay and reaching the wall where she was reunited with a recently resurrected Jon. She was also wearing grey which is I think the show\u2019s way of linking back to this prophecy in the books.\u00a0</p><p><b>The Ghost of High Heart prophecies</b></p><p>In case anyone is not familiar with who the Ghost of High Heart is, she\u2019s\u00a0\n\na dwarfish, albino woman who was reputed to be a woods witch in the Riverlands.\u00a0\n\nArya\u00a0and the brotherhood without banners camp overnight at High Heart, to meet with the ghost to hear her tell the future, and to learn the whereabouts of Beric.\n\n</p><p>She accurately predicts a few things that have happened in both books and show. In addition, there are also these:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\nI dreamt of a man without a face, waiting on a bridge that swayed and swung\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>In the books, this is Euron hiring a Faceless Man (and potentially paying for his services with a dragon egg) to kill his brother, Balon Greyjoy, the King of the Iron Islands. In the show Euron does the deed himself, on a bridge that swayed and swung.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\nI dreamt of a maid at a feast with purple serpents in her hair, venom dripping from their fangs. And later I dreamt that maid again, slaying a savage giant in a castle built of snow.<br/></p></blockquote><p>This is generally believed to be about Sansa because of the poisoned hairnet she wears in her hair that eventually kills Jofferey. I\u2019d argue that by ordering the death of Littlefinger in Winterfell (a castle in the North where there\u2019s a lot of snow), the show has paid off the later part of this prophecy.\u00a0</p><p>She also says this directly to Arya:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\nI see you. I see you, wolf child. Blood child. I thought it was the lord who smelled of death \u2026 You are cruel to come to my hill, cruel. I gorged on grief at Summerhall, I need none of yours. Begone from here, dark heart. Begone!<br/></p></blockquote><p>This could be nothing but the woman noticing Arya\u2019s increasing violence and tendency towards killing but because she mentions Summerhall it\u2019s speculated that she is referring to a future and particularly bloody event Arya will participate in. Assuming that, I would say the show has already paid that off when Arya killed off all the Freys in an act of mass murder.\u00a0</p><p>This is a bit dubious, though, because of the fact that Lady Stoneheart has been cut from the show. It\u2019s likely that it will be LS that kills off the Freys in the books and the show simply gave that particular plot point to Arya.\u00a0</p><p>That doesn\u2019t eliminate the possibility that the Ghost of High Heart is potentially referring to a future Summerhall-like event Arya will be involved in and if that is the case I fully expect the show to include it.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>And finally we have what are essentially sayings that are mentioned frequently in the show but because of their implications they act like prophecy in the sense that they foreshadow future events but not in a clear cut way.\u00a0</p><p><b>The Long Night</b></p><blockquote><p>Melisandre: For the night is dark and full of terrors.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>This is pretty self-explanatory. We\u2019ve been told that when the WWs first came 8000 years ago, they brought a night and a winter that lasted a generation. So the WWs are back at it and are going to bring darkness and terror.\u00a0</p><p>We should start preparing ourselves for at least 3 episodes of almost exclusive night time scenes. This is also supported by the actors saying that they had about 40 days worth of night time shootings which is an incredibly long time for that sort of thing.\u00a0</p><p><b>When a Targeryen is born, the Gods flip a coin</b></p><p>This is obviously a saying that came about in reference to the Targeryens being or going mad more often than not.\u00a0</p><p>However, at this point in the story, we have only two Targeryens left so the duality of a coin flip becomes foreshadowing for Jon and D*ny as foils.\u00a0</p><p><b>I wish you good fortunes in the wars to come</b></p><p>This has only been uttered in show by adversaries, first in the Stannis/Mance conversation prior to Mance being burned alive and then in the Ned/Arthur Dane flashback. The third instance is in the Jon/D*ny good-bye scene. I don\u2019t know about anyone else but this indicated to me \u2026 Dance of Dragons 2.0.\u00a0</p><p><b>Sansa\u2019s red comet prediction</b></p><blockquote><p><i>The morning of King Joffrey\u2019s name day dawned bright and windy, with the long tail of the great comet visible through the high scuttling clouds. Sansa was watching it from her tower window when Ser Arys Oakheart arrived to escort her down to the tourney grounds. \u201cWhat do you think it means?\u201d she asked him.</i></p><p><i>\u201c<b>Glory to your betrothed</b>,\u201d Ser Arys answered at once. \u201cSee how it flames across the sky today on His Grace\u2019s name day, as if the gods themselves had raised a banner in his honor. The smallfolk have named it King Joffrey\u2019s Comet.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Doubtless that was what they told Joffrey; Sansa was not so sure. \u201c<b>I\u2019ve heard servants calling it the Dragon\u2019s Tail.</b>\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cKing Joffrey sits where <b>Aegon the Dragon</b> once sat, in the castle built by his son,\u201d Ser Arys said. \u201c<b>He is the dragon\u2019s heir</b> - and crimson is the color of House Lannister, another sign. This comet is sent to herald Joffrey\u2019s ascent to the throne, I have no doubt. It means that he will triumph over his enemies.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>Yeah, Jofferey wasn\u2019t and he didn\u2019t. If only there was a guy in this story who was the dragon\u2019s heir and whose birth name the show \n\n incidentally \n\nspoiled as being Aegon. Glory to that guy! And to his queen!\u00a0</p><p>Suffice it to say I think we will get the pay off from this scene in the form of Jonsa.\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>Just a small addendum before I finish: A Song of Ice and Fire is littered with prophecies, prophetic dreams, cryptic messages that can be interpreted to signal future events, etc. I probably missed a lot of them. So if there\u2019s something you want to add here please do.\u00a0</p><p>Thanks for the ask, nonnie!</p>",

Stars will bleed. The cold breath of winter will freeze the seas and the Dead shall rise in the North. In the ancient books it\u2019s written that a warrior shall draw a burning sword from the fire and that sword shall be Lightbringer.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>This is very much in play, having been mentioned as recently as season 7 and I believe that by the end of season 8 we will have a definitive answer as to who and what Azor Ahai is.\u00a0</p><p>I\u2019ve talked about this before in this <a href=\"https://fortunatelylori.tumblr.com/post/182112197071/do-you-subscribe-to-the-theory-that-jamie-is-the\">post</a>. Here is an excerpt:\u00a0</p><p><i>I think it\u2019s far more likely that Azor Ahai is not a hero. He\u2019s a villain and the elemental opposite to the Night King. \u00a0R'hllor followers herald Azor Ahai\u2019s second coming with such encouraging words as: \u201c he will bring an eternal summer\u201d which sounds great if you worship fire but in reality an eternal summer is about as bad as an eternal winter. If the WWs unbalance the world by plunging it into night and winter, Azor Ahai is supposed not to bring balance back but to unbalance it in the opposite direction. </i></p><p><i>Considering the placement of Azor Ahai in complete opposition to the WW and the obsession with fire of the followers of R\u2019hllor, I\u2019d say that the best candidate for this position is one D*enerys Targareyen, which doesn\u2019t sound surprising since many people theorize the same. The twist is that AA was never meant to be a hero but rather an antagonist. <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3sVGPVR6Ra7mnliy4eLYPg\">@trinuviel</a> has <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/168087267884/azor-ahai-the-prince-that-was-promised-and-the\">a fantastic series</a> regarding this topic and I would encourage you to read it. She goes into a lot more detail than I am able to provide. </i></p><p>One aspect of this prophecy that is not brought up in the show is Nissa Nissa:\u00a0</p><p><i>To fight the darkness, Azor Ahai needed to forge a hero\u2019s sword. He labored for thirty days and thirty nights until it was done. However, when he went to temper it in water, the sword broke. He was not one to give up easily, so he started over.</i></p><p><i>The second time he took fifty days and fifty nights to make the sword, even better than the first. To temper it this time, he captured a lion and drove the sword into its heart, but once more the steel shattered.</i></p><p><i>The third time, with a heavy heart, for he knew beforehand what he must do to finish the blade, he worked for a hundred days and nights until it was finished. This time, he called for his wife, Nissa<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fawoiaf.westeros.org%2Findex.php%2FNissa_Nissa&amp;t=NjZhZTA1OTM1ZGI4MzliZTk2YzJkMDk5NTRjNjE2NGMyY2ZhMGE2MSxSdVpDcnl4ZA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Ayx6zQsV7n9nxh5cxFinRIg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ffortunatelylori.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F182112197071%2Fdo-you-subscribe-to-the-theory-that-jamie-is-the&amp;m=1\" title=\"Nissa Nissa\"> </a>Nissa, and asked her to bare her breast. He drove his sword into her living heart, her soul combining with the steel of the sword, creating Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes.</i></p><p>People have been speculating for years on who might be the Nissa Nissa in the story but because this isn\u2019t mentioned in the show, I\u2019m not really sure this will be paid off. However, considering Melisandre\u2019s obsession with blood magic and human sacrifice, I think there\u2019s a possibility that a candidate will arise. And in my opinion, that would probably be Mel herself. She foretold her own death in season 7 and because of the nature of her arc, the relation to fire, blood and magic I can see her as a willing human sacrifice for the glory of the prophesied hero.\u00a0</p><p>However, since I don\u2019t think she is interpreting the prophecy of Azor Ahai correctly and that AA is probably not the person that will end the Long Night, I don\u2019t think this human sacrifice in the form of Nissa Nissa 2.0 will have an effect or at least not the desired one.\u00a0</p><p>In the comments section of the post I linked above, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3sVGPVR6Ra7mnliy4eLYPg\">@trinuviel</a> brought forth the idea that the story of Nissa Nissa and Lightbringer is a metaphorical set of instructions on how to forge Valyrian steel. And I have to say that\u2019s a very intriguing idea and one that sounds very plausible to me for several reasons:\u00a0</p><p>1. Valyrian steel swords are already magical swords and we know they are effective against the WWs. What could a burning sword do that these other swords can\u2019t?</p><p>2. The Valyrians were known to practice blood magic and it\u2019s theorized that\u2019s where the source of most of their power came from, including their bond with dragons.\u00a0</p><p>3. GRRM has purposefully pointed to the mystery surrounding the forging of Valyrian steel in story several times. There must be a pretty big reason why he hasn\u2019t revealed how these swords are forged.\u00a0</p><p><b>The Younger More Beautiful Queen</b></p><blockquote><p>Maggy the Frog: Oh, yes! You\u2019ll be queen \u2026 For a time. Then comes another. Younger. More beautiful. To cast you down and take all you hold dear.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>I believe the last time Cersei mentioned her encounter with Maggy the Frog was after Myrcella was killed. So this will be paid off in season 8.</p><p>I\u2019ve made the argument in the past that Sansa is the younger, more beautiful queen that will cast Cersei down and take all that she holds dear:\u00a0</p><p><i>Sansa has been intimately involved in all of Cersei\u2019s tragedies even though she is not directly responsible. She was the one that carried the poison that killed Jofferey, the war with her brother is the reason why Myrcella was sent to Dorne, Jofferey\u2019s death leads to Tommen becoming king and eventually killing himself. And, by the end of this series, Sansa might end up as queen of the Seven Kingdoms effectively replacing Cersei. </i></p><p><i>It isn\u2019t that Sansa is directly responsible for what happens to Cersei but that she ends up taking everything from her in a way that no one could have predicted unless you look back at the events.\u00a0</i></p><p>There is an aspect of this prophecy that isn\u2019t mentioned but I think will be paid off as well:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\nAnd when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you.\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>I honestly have no idea why they chose not to include this in the show since it\u2019s part of the same conversation as the younger, more beautiful queen. They might bring it up in season 8 through another flash-back and I think that they should. Either way, I\u2019m pretty sure we will find out who the valonqar is.\u00a0</p><p>I\u2019ve made an argument for Jaime because I think it will be a fitting end to their story and because of what Cersei told Ned about her and Jaime back in season 1:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Cersei: Jaime and I are more than brother and sister. We shared a womb. We came into this world together. We belong together.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>And by that logic \u2026 they will die together. Or at least one will be the end to the other.\u00a0</p><p><b>The Prince that was Promised</b></p><blockquote><p>Melisandre: You should kneel before your brother. He\u2019s the lord\u2019s chosen. Born amidst salt and smoke.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>This is a dicey one because it\u2019s only brought up by Mel as an interchangeable title for Azor Ahai.\u00a0</p><p>In the books, however, the PTWP is also brought up in relation to Rhaegar and his prophecy fulfilling quest. When D*ny visits the House of the Undying, she has a vision of her brother holding his infant son, Aegon, by Elia Martell and saying this:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Rhaegar: <a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aegon_Targaryen_(son_of_Rhaegar)\" title=\"Aegon Targaryen (son of Rhaegar)\">Aegon</a>. What better name for a king?<br></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Elia: Will you make a song for him?<br></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Rhaegar:<b>\u00a0</b>He has a song. He is the prince that was promised, and his is the song of ice and fire.</p></blockquote><p>From what we know at this time, Rhaegar never brings up the Azor Ahai prophecy and we don\u2019t know that much about the PTWP. But I tend to think these two aren\u2019t related.\u00a0</p><p>I believe the PTWP is Jon. His is the only story that is linked to both fire and ice. He is the literal product of the song of ice and fire (the son of a Targareyen and a Stark) and his story is connected to both ice and fire through out. He fights against Ice in the form of the White Walkers and he encounters both the false Azor Ahai (Stannis) and now D*ny, who is the person associated the most with fire in the series. If the Dance of Dragons 2.0 and dark D*ny theories become canon, his song of ice and fire would be his titular role in both these great wars that are about to visit Westeros. He also has\u00a0\u201csalt and smoke\u201d imagery associated with his death (and subsequent resurrection).\u00a0</p><p>So I tend to see the PTWP and AA as actually being ultimate adversaries.\u00a0</p><p>What I\u2019m doubting at the moment is whether or not the show will bother differentiating between these two. I do think that by confirming Dark D*ny and the Dance of Dragons 2.0, they will essentially pay off this prophecy but I\u2019m not sure they\u2019ll signal the distinction.\u00a0</p><p>That\u2019s about it on the show-included prophecies, I think.</p><p><b>Prophecies not mentioned in the show</b></p><p><b>The Last Hero</b></p><blockquote><p>\n\nLegends of the north state the last hero and his companions went in search of the children of the forest during the Long Night, thousands of years ago. The only survivor of the company after attacks from giants, wights, and Others, the last hero eventually reached the children and gained their assistance. The Night\u2019s Watch then formed and won the Battle for the Dawn. This ended the generation-long winter and sent the Others into retreat, possibly to the Land of Always Winter. The fate of the last hero is unknown\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>One could make an argument that this is not a prophecy but rather a story but because the Battle for the Dawn 2.0 is fast approaching, this story/prophecy will most likely be paid off in season 8.\u00a0</p><p>\n\nIf anyone is destined to be the hero to save the world from the Long Night that character is Bran Stark and his story is linked to the legend of the Last Hero, who is also identified as Bran the Builder. This connection is not fully established yet but I believe the characters of the Last Hero and Bran the Builder to be one and the same.\u00a0</p><p>Bran is the Three Eyed Raven, he\u2019s traveled to the Lands of Always Winter and reached the children of the forest. That\u2019s enough evidence for me to assume that his role in season 8 and the defeat of the WWs will pay off the Legend of the Last Hero. Incidentally, Bran the Builder is mentioned in relation to our Bran by Maester Luwin in season 1.\u00a0<br></p><p>We might also get a pay off for how the Wall and Winterfell were actually built although I do think part of this story will remain a mystery that will most likely be tackled in the Long Night prequel.\u00a0</p><p><b>D*ny\u2019s prophecies in the House of the Undying</b></p><blockquote><p>\u2026 mother of dragons, daughter of death \u2026 <br></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u2026 mother of dragons, slayer of lies \u2026 <br></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u2026 mother of dragons, bride of fire \u2026 </p></blockquote><p>\n\nEssentially, I believe all of these will be paid off by the Dark D*ny reveal. \n\n<br></p><blockquote><p>\n\nthree fires must you light\u2026 one for life and one for death and one to love\u2026 three mounts must you ride\u2026 one to bed and one to dread and one to love\u2026 three treasons will you know\u2026 once for blood and once for gold and once for love\u2026\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>I think it was a huge mistake for the show not to include the 3 treasons prophecy in D*ny\u2019s storyline, particularly since they included Cersei\u2019s Younger More Beautiful Queen one. Because the three treasons prophecy works on D*ny\u2019s psyche much in the same way it does on Cersei\u2019s.\u00a0</p><p>They both become increasingly paranoid and obsessed with these ominous predictions and are actively on the look-out for potential candidates.\u00a0</p><p>However I think the pol!jon reveal will resolve the 3rd treason aspect of the prophecy as well as this:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\nA blue flower growing from a chink in a wall of ice, filling the air with sweetness.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A great stone beast takes wing from a smoking tower, breathing shadows.</p></blockquote><p>Between the parentage reveal and Political Jon, her lover turned nephew, Jon Snow, will turn from the flower that fills the air with sweetness into the great stone beast that will oppose her.</p><p>There\u2019s also a case to be made that the three treasons are actually treasons D*ny commits against other people, as <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m61FcucyaOKFkj0gFLKRgJA\">@thelawyerthatwaspromised</a> has detailed on her blog. And by going to war with Jon and potentially turning her back on the fight with the WWs, D*ny would essentially become a betrayer.\u00a0</p><p>So either way, I think we\u2019ll have a much clearer picture of these prophecies by the end of the show.\u00a0</p><p><b>The dragon must have three heads</b></p><p>This is the continuation of the Rhaegar vision D*ny sees in the House of the Undying.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Rhaegar:\u00a0\n\nHe has a song. He is the prince that was promised, and his is the song of ice and fire. <b>There must be one more. The dragon has three heads.\n\n</b></p></blockquote><p>We don\u2019t know much of anything about what this means or how Rhaegar thought it would link to the PTWP prophecy. I wouldn\u2019t have included it, to be honest, if it wasn\u2019t for the Crypts of Winterfell teaser and the staging of Jon/Arya/Sansa as a play on the original three heads of the dragon Aegon/Visenya/Rhaenys. In a previous <a href=\"https://fortunatelylori.tumblr.com/post/182374969101/hi-im-a-huge-jonsa-fan-and-im-against-a-targ\">post</a> I said this:\u00a0</p><p><i>\n\nThe \u201cDragon must have 3 heads\u201d is generally considered the reason why Rhaegar started his relationship with Lyanna and the main reason why Jon was even born. Details on this prophecy are foggy but the theory goes that at some point Rhaegar became convinced that his three children would be instrumental in saving the world and because Elia Martell was unable to bare another child after her two pregnancies, he went after teenage Lyanna Stark, thus looking to fulfill yet another prophecy: that of the Prince that was Promised whose song is the song of ice and fire. \n\n</i><br></p><p><i>In trying to fulfill it, Rhaegar named his children after the 3 original Targs that conquered Westeros: Elia gave him an Aegon and a Rhaenys so he went in search of his Visenya. Clearly he failed, because instead of a girl, he got a boy. </i></p><p><i>However, as GRRM points out through out his story, prophecies are tricky and the more you go out of your way to fulfill them, the more blunders you\u2019re bound to commit. That doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t some value to it but it will most likely come to pass in a way that you did not expect. </i></p><p><i>It makes you wonder just what the \u201c3 heads of the dragon\u201d might actually be about. Everyone tends to think that this prophecy is linked to the war with the WWs. However, by introducing Sansa into the mix, it changes things a bit \u2026\n\n<br></i></p><p><i>What if the \u201cDragon must have 3 heads\u201d prophecy isn\u2019t related to the War of the Dawn at all but rather to the Dance of Dragons 2.0? Because in that war, Sansa would truly be instrumental: by making Jon a Stark, because of her political expertise and her strategic connections all over Westeros. So instead of creating the ultimate Targ team to face off against the apocalypse, Rhaegar not only brought down his father\u2019s dynasty and his own in Robert\u2019s rebellion but also created the circumstances by which, years later, his son would face off against the last scion of House Targareyen and bring about the demise of all living dragons.\n\n</i><br></p><p>While this could simply remain something that will be inferred by the way season 8 plays out, I think there\u2019s a case to be made that we will actually get more insight here via flash-backs of Rhaegar/Lyanna.\u00a0</p><p>I think it\u2019s also possible that through these flashbacks we will find out more about the situation surrounding the abduction of Lyanna, more insight into the year they spent in the Tower of Joy and even perhaps the name that Rhaegar whispered as he lay dying on the Trident.\u00a0</p><p><b>The Lannister gold prophecy</b></p><blockquote><p>\n\nThe wealth of the westerlands was matched, in ancient times, with the hunger of the Freehold of Valyria for precious metals, yet there seems no evidence that the dragonlords ever made contact with the lords of the Rock, Casterly or Lannister. Septon Barth speculated on the matter, referring to a Valyrian text that has since been lost, suggesting that the Freehold\u2019s sorcerers foretold that the gold of Casterly Rock would destroy them.\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>This is a very obscure prophecy and I haven\u2019t seen many people discuss it. The few that I have seen talk about this link it to the Lannister\u2019s long lost Valyrian steel sword, Brightroar. The Valyrians, fearing this prophecy Septon Barth mentions, always refused to sell the Lannisters a sword but they managed to get their hands on one by other means:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\nBrightroar came into the possession of the Lannister kings in the century before the Doom of Valyria, and it is said that the weight of gold they paid for it would have been enough to raise an army.\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>So people speculate that it was the purchasing of this sword that lead up to the Doom of Valyria.\u00a0However, I don\u2019t really see this as a possibility because GRRM never really plays prophecies this straight.\u00a0</p><p>However, one thing we do know is going to happen in season 8 is that Cersei will be acquiring the Golden Company, whose banner is simple golden cloth. She will also be paying for it with what can be described as Lannister gold.\u00a0</p><p>Also since the show didn\u2019t include the Young Griff story line, it\u2019s not outside the realm of possibility that the GC is leaded by Jon Connington, one of Rhaegar\u2019s best buddies and also the guy who was in love with him.\u00a0</p><p>So if let\u2019s say the GC would decide to join Jon\u2019s forces against D*ny during the Dance of Dragons, a case can be made that Lannister Gold did in fact bring about the ultimate doom of Valyria, by killing off its last real member and putting an end to the dragons.\u00a0</p><p>Then there are a few prophecies that I believe have already been paid off.\u00a0</p><p><b>The mummer\u2019s dragon</b></p><blockquote><p>A cloth dragon sways on poles amidst a cheering crowd.</p></blockquote><p>By essentially removing the Young Griff from the story line completely, I think the show has revealed that this young man is not Aegon Targareyen but a pretender whose lie, and life, D*ny will slay in the books.\u00a0</p><p><b>The girl in grey prophecy</b></p><blockquote><p>\n\nI have seen your sister in my fires, fleeing from this marriage they have made for her. Coming here, to you. A girl in grey on a dying horse, I have seen it plain as day. It has not happened yet, but it will.\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>I think everyone in the Jonsa fandom can agree that the girl in grey is in effect Sansa Stark and she will flee her marriage to Harry Hardyng and join Jon at the wall.\u00a0</p><p>The show had Sansa fleeing her marriage to Ramsay and reaching the wall where she was reunited with a recently resurrected Jon. She was also wearing grey which is I think the show\u2019s way of linking back to this prophecy in the books.\u00a0</p><p><b>The Ghost of High Heart prophecies</b></p><p>In case anyone is not familiar with who the Ghost of High Heart is, she\u2019s\u00a0\n\na dwarfish, albino woman who was reputed to be a woods witch in the Riverlands.\u00a0\n\nArya\u00a0and the brotherhood without banners camp overnight at High Heart, to meet with the ghost to hear her tell the future, and to learn the whereabouts of Beric.\n\n</p><p>She accurately predicts a few things that have happened in both books and show. In addition, there are also these:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\nI dreamt of a man without a face, waiting on a bridge that swayed and swung\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>In the books, this is Euron hiring a Faceless Man (and potentially paying for his services with a dragon egg) to kill his brother, Balon Greyjoy, the King of the Iron Islands. In the show Euron does the deed himself, on a bridge that swayed and swung.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\nI dreamt of a maid at a feast with purple serpents in her hair, venom dripping from their fangs. And later I dreamt that maid again, slaying a savage giant in a castle built of snow.<br></p></blockquote><p>This is generally believed to be about Sansa because of the poisoned hairnet she wears in her hair that eventually kills Jofferey. I\u2019d argue that by ordering the death of Littlefinger in Winterfell (a castle in the North where there\u2019s a lot of snow), the show has paid off the later part of this prophecy.\u00a0</p><p>She also says this directly to Arya:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\nI see you. I see you, wolf child. Blood child. I thought it was the lord who smelled of death \u2026 You are cruel to come to my hill, cruel. I gorged on grief at Summerhall, I need none of yours. Begone from here, dark heart. Begone!<br></p></blockquote><p>This could be nothing but the woman noticing Arya\u2019s increasing violence and tendency towards killing but because she mentions Summerhall it\u2019s speculated that she is referring to a future and particularly bloody event Arya will participate in. Assuming that, I would say the show has already paid that off when Arya killed off all the Freys in an act of mass murder.\u00a0</p><p>This is a bit dubious, though, because of the fact that Lady Stoneheart has been cut from the show. It\u2019s likely that it will be LS that kills off the Freys in the books and the show simply gave that particular plot point to Arya.\u00a0</p><p>That doesn\u2019t eliminate the possibility that the Ghost of High Heart is potentially referring to a future Summerhall-like event Arya will be involved in and if that is the case I fully expect the show to include it.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>And finally we have what are essentially sayings that are mentioned frequently in the show but because of their implications they act like prophecy in the sense that they foreshadow future events but not in a clear cut way.\u00a0</p><p><b>The Long Night</b></p><blockquote><p>Melisandre: For the night is dark and full of terrors.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>This is pretty self-explanatory. We\u2019ve been told that when the WWs first came 8000 years ago, they brought a night and a winter that lasted a generation. So the WWs are back at it and are going to bring darkness and terror.\u00a0</p><p>We should start preparing ourselves for at least 3 episodes of almost exclusive night time scenes. This is also supported by the actors saying that they had about 40 days worth of night time shootings which is an incredibly long time for that sort of thing.\u00a0</p><p><b>When a Targeryen is born, the Gods flip a coin</b></p><p>This is obviously a saying that came about in reference to the Targeryens being or going mad more often than not.\u00a0</p><p>However, at this point in the story, we have only two Targeryens left so the duality of a coin flip becomes foreshadowing for Jon and D*ny as foils.\u00a0</p><p><b>I wish you good fortunes in the wars to come</b></p><p>This has only been uttered in show by adversaries, first in the Stannis/Mance conversation prior to Mance being burned alive and then in the Ned/Arthur Dane flashback. The third instance is in the Jon/D*ny good-bye scene. I don\u2019t know about anyone else but this indicated to me \u2026 Dance of Dragons 2.0.\u00a0</p><p><b>Sansa\u2019s red comet prediction</b></p><blockquote><p><i>The morning of King Joffrey\u2019s name day dawned bright and windy, with the long tail of the great comet visible through the high scuttling clouds. Sansa was watching it from her tower window when Ser Arys Oakheart arrived to escort her down to the tourney grounds. \u201cWhat do you think it means?\u201d she asked him.</i></p><p><i>\u201c<b>Glory to your betrothed</b>,\u201d Ser Arys answered at once. \u201cSee how it flames across the sky today on His Grace\u2019s name day, as if the gods themselves had raised a banner in his honor. The smallfolk have named it King Joffrey\u2019s Comet.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Doubtless that was what they told Joffrey; Sansa was not so sure. \u201c<b>I\u2019ve heard servants calling it the Dragon\u2019s Tail.</b>\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cKing Joffrey sits where <b>Aegon the Dragon</b> once sat, in the castle built by his son,\u201d Ser Arys said. \u201c<b>He is the dragon\u2019s heir</b> - and crimson is the color of House Lannister, another sign. This comet is sent to herald Joffrey\u2019s ascent to the throne, I have no doubt. It means that he will triumph over his enemies.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>Yeah, Jofferey wasn\u2019t and he didn\u2019t. If only there was a guy in this story who was the dragon\u2019s heir and whose birth name the show \n\n incidentally \n\nspoiled as being Aegon. Glory to that guy! And to his queen!\u00a0</p><p>Suffice it to say I think we will get the pay off from this scene in the form of Jonsa.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>Just a small addendum before I finish: A Song of Ice and Fire is littered with prophecies, prophetic dreams, cryptic messages that can be interpreted to signal future events, etc. I probably missed a lot of them. So if there\u2019s something you want to add here please do.\u00a0</p><p>Thanks for the ask, nonnie!</p>",

And a multi-layered one.\u00a0</p><p>Of course the show will have to pay-off the prophecies it included from the books. Then there are prophecies that were not mentioned in the show but by the nature of revealing the endgame and by being ahead of the books, the show will either pay them off or at least give heavy hints for what they might be in the books. And then there are foreshadowing elements that aren\u2019t really prophecies per se but serve a similar purpose in the narrative.\u00a0</p><p>So let\u2019s get started.

In the ancient books it\u2019s written that a warrior shall draw a burning sword from the fire and that sword shall be Lightbringer.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>This is very much in play, having been mentioned as recently as season 7 and I believe that by the end of season 8 we will have a definitive answer as to who and what Azor Ahai is.\u00a0</p><p>I\u2019ve talked about this before in this <a href=\"https://fortunatelylori.tumblr.com/post/182112197071/do-you-subscribe-to-the-theory-that-jamie-is-the\">post</a>. Here is an excerpt:\u00a0</p><p><i>I think it\u2019s far more likely that Azor Ahai is not a hero. He\u2019s a villain and the elemental opposite to the Night King. \u00a0R'hllor followers herald Azor Ahai\u2019s second coming with such encouraging words as: \u201c he will bring an eternal summer\u201d which sounds great if you worship fire but in reality an eternal summer is about as bad as an eternal winter. If the WWs unbalance the world by plunging it into night and winter, Azor Ahai is supposed not to bring balance back but to unbalance it in the opposite direction. </i></p><p><i>Considering the placement of Azor Ahai in complete opposition to the WW and the obsession with fire of the followers of R\u2019hllor, I\u2019d say that the best candidate for this position is one D*enerys Targareyen, which doesn\u2019t sound surprising since many people theorize the same. The twist is that AA was never meant to be a hero but rather an antagonist. <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3sVGPVR6Ra7mnliy4eLYPg\">@trinuviel</a> has <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/168087267884/azor-ahai-the-prince-that-was-promised-and-the\">a fantastic series</a> regarding this topic and I would encourage you to read it. She goes into a lot more detail than I am able to provide. </i></p><p>One aspect of this prophecy that is not brought up in the show is Nissa Nissa:\u00a0</p><p><i>To fight the darkness, Azor Ahai needed to forge a hero\u2019s sword. He labored for thirty days and thirty nights until it was done. However, when he went to temper it in water, the sword broke. He was not one to give up easily, so he started over.</i></p><p><i>The second time he took fifty days and fifty nights to make the sword, even better than the first. To temper it this time, he captured a lion and drove the sword into its heart, but once more the steel shattered.</i></p><p><i>The third time, with a heavy heart, for he knew beforehand what he must do to finish the blade, he worked for a hundred days and nights until it was finished. This time, he called for his wife, Nissa<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fawoiaf.westeros.org%2Findex.php%2FNissa_Nissa&amp;t=NjZhZTA1OTM1ZGI4MzliZTk2YzJkMDk5NTRjNjE2NGMyY2ZhMGE2MSxSdVpDcnl4ZA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Ayx6zQsV7n9nxh5cxFinRIg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ffortunatelylori.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F182112197071%2Fdo-you-subscribe-to-the-theory-that-jamie-is-the&amp;m=1\" title=\"Nissa Nissa\"> </a>Nissa, and asked her to bare her breast. He drove his sword into her living heart, her soul combining with the steel of the sword, creating Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes.</i></p><p>People have been speculating for years on who might be the Nissa Nissa in the story but because this isn\u2019t mentioned in the show, I\u2019m not really sure this will be paid off. However, considering Melisandre\u2019s obsession with blood magic and human sacrifice, I think there\u2019s a possibility that a candidate will arise. And in my opinion, that would probably be Mel herself. She foretold her own death in season 7 and because of the nature of her arc, the relation to fire, blood and magic I can see her as a willing human sacrifice for the glory of the prophesied hero.\u00a0</p><p>However, since I don\u2019t think she is interpreting the prophecy of Azor Ahai correctly and that AA is probably not the person that will end the Long Night, I don\u2019t think this human sacrifice in the form of Nissa Nissa 2.0 will have an effect or at least not the desired one.\u00a0</p><p>In the comments section of the post I linked above, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3sVGPVR6Ra7mnliy4eLYPg\">@trinuviel</a> brought forth the idea that the story of Nissa Nissa and Lightbringer is a metaphorical set of instructions on how to forge Valyrian steel. And I have to say that\u2019s a very intriguing idea and one that sounds very plausible to me for several reasons:\u00a0</p><p>1. Valyrian steel swords are already magical swords and we know they are effective against the WWs. What could a burning sword do that these other swords can\u2019t?</p><p>2. The Valyrians were known to practice blood magic and it\u2019s theorized that\u2019s where the source of most of their power came from, including their bond with dragons.\u00a0</p><p>3. GRRM has purposefully pointed to the mystery surrounding the forging of Valyrian steel in story several times. There must be a pretty big reason why he hasn\u2019t revealed how these swords are forged.\u00a0</p><p><b>The Younger More Beautiful Queen</b></p><blockquote><p>Maggy the Frog: Oh, yes! You\u2019ll be queen \u2026 For a time. Then comes another. Younger. More beautiful. To cast you down and take all you hold dear.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>I believe the last time Cersei mentioned her encounter with Maggy the Frog was after Myrcella was killed. So this will be paid off in season 8.</p><p>I\u2019ve made the argument in the past that Sansa is the younger, more beautiful queen that will cast Cersei down and take all that she holds dear:\u00a0</p><p><i>Sansa has been intimately involved in all of Cersei\u2019s tragedies even though she is not directly responsible. She was the one that carried the poison that killed Jofferey, the war with her brother is the reason why Myrcella was sent to Dorne, Jofferey\u2019s death leads to Tommen becoming king and eventually killing himself. And, by the end of this series, Sansa might end up as queen of the Seven Kingdoms effectively replacing Cersei. </i></p><p><i>It isn\u2019t that Sansa is directly responsible for what happens to Cersei but that she ends up taking everything from her in a way that no one could have predicted unless you look back at the events.\u00a0</i></p><p>There is an aspect of this prophecy that isn\u2019t mentioned but I think will be paid off as well:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\nAnd when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you.\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>I honestly have no idea why they chose not to include this in the show since it\u2019s part of the same conversation as the younger, more beautiful queen. They might bring it up in season 8 through another flash-back and I think that they should. Either way, I\u2019m pretty sure we will find out who the valonqar is.\u00a0</p><p>I\u2019ve made an argument for Jaime because I think it will be a fitting end to their story and because of what Cersei told Ned about her and Jaime back in season 1:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Cersei: Jaime and I are more than brother and sister. We shared a womb. We came into this world together. We belong together.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>And by that logic \u2026 they will die together. Or at least one will be the end to the other.\u00a0</p><p><b>The Prince that was Promised</b></p><blockquote><p>Melisandre: You should kneel before your brother. He\u2019s the lord\u2019s chosen. Born amidst salt and smoke.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>This is a dicey one because it\u2019s only brought up by Mel as an interchangeable title for Azor Ahai.\u00a0</p><p>In the books, however, the PTWP is also brought up in relation to Rhaegar and his prophecy fulfilling quest. When D*ny visits the House of the Undying, she has a vision of her brother holding his infant son, Aegon, by Elia Martell and saying this:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Rhaegar: <a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aegon_Targaryen_(son_of_Rhaegar)\" title=\"Aegon Targaryen (son of Rhaegar)\">Aegon</a>. What better name for a king?<br></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Elia: Will you make a song for him?<br></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Rhaegar:<b>\u00a0</b>He has a song. He is the prince that was promised, and his is the song of ice and fire.</p></blockquote><p>From what we know at this time, Rhaegar never brings up the Azor Ahai prophecy and we don\u2019t know that much about the PTWP. But I tend to think these two aren\u2019t related.\u00a0</p><p>I believe the PTWP is Jon. His is the only story that is linked to both fire and ice. He is the literal product of the song of ice and fire (the son of a Targareyen and a Stark) and his story is connected to both ice and fire through out. He fights against Ice in the form of the White Walkers and he encounters both the false Azor Ahai (Stannis) and now D*ny, who is the person associated the most with fire in the series. If the Dance of Dragons 2.0 and dark D*ny theories become canon, his song of ice and fire would be his titular role in both these great wars that are about to visit Westeros. He also has\u00a0\u201csalt and smoke\u201d imagery associated with his death (and subsequent resurrection).\u00a0</p><p>So I tend to see the PTWP and AA as actually being ultimate adversaries.\u00a0</p><p>What I\u2019m doubting at the moment is whether or not the show will bother differentiating between these two. I do think that by confirming Dark D*ny and the Dance of Dragons 2.0, they will essentially pay off this prophecy but I\u2019m not sure they\u2019ll signal the distinction.\u00a0</p><p>That\u2019s about it on the show-included prophecies, I think.</p><p><b>Prophecies not mentioned in the show</b></p><p><b>The Last Hero</b></p><blockquote><p>\n\nLegends of the north state the last hero and his companions went in search of the children of the forest during the Long Night, thousands of years ago. The only survivor of the company after attacks from giants, wights, and Others, the last hero eventually reached the children and gained their assistance. The Night\u2019s Watch then formed and won the Battle for the Dawn. This ended the generation-long winter and sent the Others into retreat, possibly to the Land of Always Winter. The fate of the last hero is unknown\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>One could make an argument that this is not a prophecy but rather a story but because the Battle for the Dawn 2.0 is fast approaching, this story/prophecy will most likely be paid off in season 8.\u00a0</p><p>\n\nIf anyone is destined to be the hero to save the world from the Long Night that character is Bran Stark and his story is linked to the legend of the Last Hero, who is also identified as Bran the Builder. This connection is not fully established yet but I believe the characters of the Last Hero and Bran the Builder to be one and the same.\u00a0</p><p>Bran is the Three Eyed Raven, he\u2019s traveled to the Lands of Always Winter and reached the children of the forest. That\u2019s enough evidence for me to assume that his role in season 8 and the defeat of the WWs will pay off the Legend of the Last Hero. Incidentally, Bran the Builder is mentioned in relation to our Bran by Maester Luwin in season 1.\u00a0<br></p><p>We might also get a pay off for how the Wall and Winterfell were actually built although I do think part of this story will remain a mystery that will most likely be tackled in the Long Night prequel.\u00a0</p><p><b>D*ny\u2019s prophecies in the House of the Undying</b></p><blockquote><p>\u2026 mother of dragons, daughter of death \u2026 <br></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u2026 mother of dragons, slayer of lies \u2026 <br></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u2026 mother of dragons, bride of fire \u2026 </p></blockquote><p>\n\nEssentially, I believe all of these will be paid off by the Dark D*ny reveal. \n\n<br></p><blockquote><p>\n\nthree fires must you light\u2026 one for life and one for death and one to love\u2026 three mounts must you ride\u2026 one to bed and one to dread and one to love\u2026 three treasons will you know\u2026 once for blood and once for gold and once for love\u2026\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>I think it was a huge mistake for the show not to include the 3 treasons prophecy in D*ny\u2019s storyline, particularly since they included Cersei\u2019s Younger More Beautiful Queen one. Because the three treasons prophecy works on D*ny\u2019s psyche much in the same way it does on Cersei\u2019s.\u00a0</p><p>They both become increasingly paranoid and obsessed with these ominous predictions and are actively on the look-out for potential candidates.\u00a0</p><p>However I think the pol!jon reveal will resolve the 3rd treason aspect of the prophecy as well as this:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\nA blue flower growing from a chink in a wall of ice, filling the air with sweetness.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A great stone beast takes wing from a smoking tower, breathing shadows.</p></blockquote><p>Between the parentage reveal and Political Jon, her lover turned nephew, Jon Snow, will turn from the flower that fills the air with sweetness into the great stone beast that will oppose her.</p><p>There\u2019s also a case to be made that the three treasons are actually treasons D*ny commits against other people, as <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m61FcucyaOKFkj0gFLKRgJA\">@thelawyerthatwaspromised</a> has detailed on her blog. And by going to war with Jon and potentially turning her back on the fight with the WWs, D*ny would essentially become a betrayer.\u00a0</p><p>So either way, I think we\u2019ll have a much clearer picture of these prophecies by the end of the show.\u00a0</p><p><b>The dragon must have three heads</b></p><p>This is the continuation of the Rhaegar vision D*ny sees in the House of the Undying.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Rhaegar:\u00a0\n\nHe has a song. He is the prince that was promised, and his is the song of ice and fire. <b>There must be one more. The dragon has three heads.\n\n</b></p></blockquote><p>We don\u2019t know much of anything about what this means or how Rhaegar thought it would link to the PTWP prophecy. I wouldn\u2019t have included it, to be honest, if it wasn\u2019t for the Crypts of Winterfell teaser and the staging of Jon/Arya/Sansa as a play on the original three heads of the dragon Aegon/Visenya/Rhaenys. In a previous <a href=\"https://fortunatelylori.tumblr.com/post/182374969101/hi-im-a-huge-jonsa-fan-and-im-against-a-targ\">post</a> I said this:\u00a0</p><p><i>\n\nThe \u201cDragon must have 3 heads\u201d is generally considered the reason why Rhaegar started his relationship with Lyanna and the main reason why Jon was even born. Details on this prophecy are foggy but the theory goes that at some point Rhaegar became convinced that his three children would be instrumental in saving the world and because Elia Martell was unable to bare another child after her two pregnancies, he went after teenage Lyanna Stark, thus looking to fulfill yet another prophecy: that of the Prince that was Promised whose song is the song of ice and fire. \n\n</i><br></p><p><i>In trying to fulfill it, Rhaegar named his children after the 3 original Targs that conquered Westeros: Elia gave him an Aegon and a Rhaenys so he went in search of his Visenya. Clearly he failed, because instead of a girl, he got a boy. </i></p><p><i>However, as GRRM points out through out his story, prophecies are tricky and the more you go out of your way to fulfill them, the more blunders you\u2019re bound to commit. That doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t some value to it but it will most likely come to pass in a way that you did not expect. </i></p><p><i>It makes you wonder just what the \u201c3 heads of the dragon\u201d might actually be about. Everyone tends to think that this prophecy is linked to the war with the WWs. However, by introducing Sansa into the mix, it changes things a bit \u2026\n\n<br></i></p><p><i>What if the \u201cDragon must have 3 heads\u201d prophecy isn\u2019t related to the War of the Dawn at all but rather to the Dance of Dragons 2.0? Because in that war, Sansa would truly be instrumental: by making Jon a Stark, because of her political expertise and her strategic connections all over Westeros. So instead of creating the ultimate Targ team to face off against the apocalypse, Rhaegar not only brought down his father\u2019s dynasty and his own in Robert\u2019s rebellion but also created the circumstances by which, years later, his son would face off against the last scion of House Targareyen and bring about the demise of all living dragons.\n\n</i><br></p><p>While this could simply remain something that will be inferred by the way season 8 plays out, I think there\u2019s a case to be made that we will actually get more insight here via flash-backs of Rhaegar/Lyanna.\u00a0</p><p>I think it\u2019s also possible that through these flashbacks we will find out more about the situation surrounding the abduction of Lyanna, more insight into the year they spent in the Tower of Joy and even perhaps the name that Rhaegar whispered as he lay dying on the Trident.\u00a0</p><p><b>The Lannister gold prophecy</b></p><blockquote><p>\n\nThe wealth of the westerlands was matched, in ancient times, with the hunger of the Freehold of Valyria for precious metals, yet there seems no evidence that the dragonlords ever made contact with the lords of the Rock, Casterly or Lannister. Septon Barth speculated on the matter, referring to a Valyrian text that has since been lost, suggesting that the Freehold\u2019s sorcerers foretold that the gold of Casterly Rock would destroy them.\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>This is a very obscure prophecy and I haven\u2019t seen many people discuss it. The few that I have seen talk about this link it to the Lannister\u2019s long lost Valyrian steel sword, Brightroar. The Valyrians, fearing this prophecy Septon Barth mentions, always refused to sell the Lannisters a sword but they managed to get their hands on one by other means:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\nBrightroar came into the possession of the Lannister kings in the century before the Doom of Valyria, and it is said that the weight of gold they paid for it would have been enough to raise an army.\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>So people speculate that it was the purchasing of this sword that lead up to the Doom of Valyria.\u00a0However, I don\u2019t really see this as a possibility because GRRM never really plays prophecies this straight.\u00a0</p><p>However, one thing we do know is going to happen in season 8 is that Cersei will be acquiring the Golden Company, whose banner is simple golden cloth. She will also be paying for it with what can be described as Lannister gold.\u00a0</p><p>Also since the show didn\u2019t include the Young Griff story line, it\u2019s not outside the realm of possibility that the GC is leaded by Jon Connington, one of Rhaegar\u2019s best buddies and also the guy who was in love with him.\u00a0</p><p>So if let\u2019s say the GC would decide to join Jon\u2019s forces against D*ny during the Dance of Dragons, a case can be made that Lannister Gold did in fact bring about the ultimate doom of Valyria, by killing off its last real member and putting an end to the dragons.\u00a0</p><p>Then there are a few prophecies that I believe have already been paid off.\u00a0</p><p><b>The mummer\u2019s dragon</b></p><blockquote><p>A cloth dragon sways on poles amidst a cheering crowd.</p></blockquote><p>By essentially removing the Young Griff from the story line completely, I think the show has revealed that this young man is not Aegon Targareyen but a pretender whose lie, and life, D*ny will slay in the books.\u00a0</p><p><b>The girl in grey prophecy</b></p><blockquote><p>\n\nI have seen your sister in my fires, fleeing from this marriage they have made for her. Coming here, to you. A girl in grey on a dying horse, I have seen it plain as day. It has not happened yet, but it will.\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>I think everyone in the Jonsa fandom can agree that the girl in grey is in effect Sansa Stark and she will flee her marriage to Harry Hardyng and join Jon at the wall.\u00a0</p><p>The show had Sansa fleeing her marriage to Ramsay and reaching the wall where she was reunited with a recently resurrected Jon. She was also wearing grey which is I think the show\u2019s way of linking back to this prophecy in the books.\u00a0</p><p><b>The Ghost of High Heart prophecies</b></p><p>In case anyone is not familiar with who the Ghost of High Heart is, she\u2019s\u00a0\n\na dwarfish, albino woman who was reputed to be a woods witch in the Riverlands.\u00a0\n\nArya\u00a0and the brotherhood without banners camp overnight at High Heart, to meet with the ghost to hear her tell the future, and to learn the whereabouts of Beric.\n\n</p><p>She accurately predicts a few things that have happened in both books and show. In addition, there are also these:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\nI dreamt of a man without a face, waiting on a bridge that swayed and swung\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>In the books, this is Euron hiring a Faceless Man (and potentially paying for his services with a dragon egg) to kill his brother, Balon Greyjoy, the King of the Iron Islands. In the show Euron does the deed himself, on a bridge that swayed and swung.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\nI dreamt of a maid at a feast with purple serpents in her hair, venom dripping from their fangs. And later I dreamt that maid again, slaying a savage giant in a castle built of snow.<br></p></blockquote><p>This is generally believed to be about Sansa because of the poisoned hairnet she wears in her hair that eventually kills Jofferey. I\u2019d argue that by ordering the death of Littlefinger in Winterfell (a castle in the North where there\u2019s a lot of snow), the show has paid off the later part of this prophecy.\u00a0</p><p>She also says this directly to Arya:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\nI see you. I see you, wolf child. Blood child. I thought it was the lord who smelled of death \u2026 You are cruel to come to my hill, cruel. I gorged on grief at Summerhall, I need none of yours. Begone from here, dark heart. Begone!<br></p></blockquote><p>This could be nothing but the woman noticing Arya\u2019s increasing violence and tendency towards killing but because she mentions Summerhall it\u2019s speculated that she is referring to a future and particularly bloody event Arya will participate in. Assuming that, I would say the show has already paid that off when Arya killed off all the Freys in an act of mass murder.\u00a0</p><p>This is a bit dubious, though, because of the fact that Lady Stoneheart has been cut from the show. It\u2019s likely that it will be LS that kills off the Freys in the books and the show simply gave that particular plot point to Arya.\u00a0</p><p>That doesn\u2019t eliminate the possibility that the Ghost of High Heart is potentially referring to a future Summerhall-like event Arya will be involved in and if that is the case I fully expect the show to include it.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>And finally we have what are essentially sayings that are mentioned frequently in the show but because of their implications they act like prophecy in the sense that they foreshadow future events but not in a clear cut way.\u00a0</p><p><b>The Long Night</b></p><blockquote><p>Melisandre: For the night is dark and full of terrors.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>This is pretty self-explanatory. We\u2019ve been told that when the WWs first came 8000 years ago, they brought a night and a winter that lasted a generation. So the WWs are back at it and are going to bring darkness and terror.\u00a0</p><p>We should start preparing ourselves for at least 3 episodes of almost exclusive night time scenes. This is also supported by the actors saying that they had about 40 days worth of night time shootings which is an incredibly long time for that sort of thing.\u00a0</p><p><b>When a Targeryen is born, the Gods flip a coin</b></p><p>This is obviously a saying that came about in reference to the Targeryens being or going mad more often than not.\u00a0</p><p>However, at this point in the story, we have only two Targeryens left so the duality of a coin flip becomes foreshadowing for Jon and D*ny as foils.\u00a0</p><p><b>I wish you good fortunes in the wars to come</b></p><p>This has only been uttered in show by adversaries, first in the Stannis/Mance conversation prior to Mance being burned alive and then in the Ned/Arthur Dane flashback. The third instance is in the Jon/D*ny good-bye scene. I don\u2019t know about anyone else but this indicated to me \u2026 Dance of Dragons 2.0.\u00a0</p><p><b>Sansa\u2019s red comet prediction</b></p><blockquote><p><i>The morning of King Joffrey\u2019s name day dawned bright and windy, with the long tail of the great comet visible through the high scuttling clouds. Sansa was watching it from her tower window when Ser Arys Oakheart arrived to escort her down to the tourney grounds. \u201cWhat do you think it means?\u201d she asked him.</i></p><p><i>\u201c<b>Glory to your betrothed</b>,\u201d Ser Arys answered at once. \u201cSee how it flames across the sky today on His Grace\u2019s name day, as if the gods themselves had raised a banner in his honor. The smallfolk have named it King Joffrey\u2019s Comet.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Doubtless that was what they told Joffrey; Sansa was not so sure. \u201c<b>I\u2019ve heard servants calling it the Dragon\u2019s Tail.</b>\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cKing Joffrey sits where <b>Aegon the Dragon</b> once sat, in the castle built by his son,\u201d Ser Arys said. \u201c<b>He is the dragon\u2019s heir</b> - and crimson is the color of House Lannister, another sign. This comet is sent to herald Joffrey\u2019s ascent to the throne, I have no doubt. It means that he will triumph over his enemies.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>Yeah, Jofferey wasn\u2019t and he didn\u2019t. If only there was a guy in this story who was the dragon\u2019s heir and whose birth name the show \n\n incidentally \n\nspoiled as being Aegon. Glory to that guy! And to his queen!\u00a0</p><p>Suffice it to say I think we will get the pay off from this scene in the form of Jonsa.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>Just a small addendum before I finish: A Song of Ice and Fire is littered with prophecies, prophetic dreams, cryptic messages that can be interpreted to signal future events, etc. I probably missed a lot of them. So if there\u2019s something you want to add here please do.\u00a0</p><p>Thanks for the ask, nonnie!</p>",
                "content": "<p>Hey, nonnie!</p><p>Hmmm &hellip; very interesting question. And a multi-layered one.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course the show will have to pay-off the prophecies it included from the books. Then there are prophecies that were not mentioned in the show but by the nature of revealing the endgame and by being ahead of the books, the show will either pay them off or at least give heavy hints for what they might be in the books. And then there are foreshadowing elements that aren&rsquo;t really prophecies per se but serve a similar purpose in the narrative.&nbsp;</p><p>So let&rsquo;s get started. Warning: this will get long.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Prophecies mentioned in the show</b></p><p><b>Azor Ahai</b></p><blockquote><p>Melisandre: After the long summer, the darkness will fall heavy on the world.

Here is an excerpt:&nbsp;</p><p><i>I think it&rsquo;s far more likely that Azor Ahai is not a hero. He&rsquo;s a villain and the elemental opposite to the Night King. &nbsp;R'hllor followers herald Azor Ahai&rsquo;s second coming with such encouraging words as: &ldquo; he will bring an eternal summer&rdquo; which sounds great if you worship fire but in reality an eternal summer is about as bad as an eternal winter. If the WWs unbalance the world by plunging it into night and winter, Azor Ahai is supposed not to bring balance back but to unbalance it in the opposite direction. </i></p><p><i>Considering the placement of Azor Ahai in complete opposition to the WW and the obsession with fire of the followers of R&rsquo;hllor, I&rsquo;d say that the best candidate for this position is one D*enerys Targareyen, which doesn&rsquo;t sound surprising since many people theorize the same. The twist is that AA was never meant to be a hero but rather an antagonist. <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3sVGPVR6Ra7mnliy4eLYPg\">@trinuviel</a> has <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/168087267884/azor-ahai-the-prince-that-was-promised-and-the\">a fantastic series</a> regarding this topic and I would encourage you to read it. She goes into a lot more detail than I am able to provide. </i></p><p>One aspect of this prophecy that is not brought up in the show is Nissa Nissa:&nbsp;</p><p><i>To fight the darkness, Azor Ahai needed to forge a hero&rsquo;s sword. He labored for thirty days and thirty nights until it was done. However, when he went to temper it in water, the sword broke. He was not one to give up easily, so he started over.</i></p><p><i>The second time he took fifty days and fifty nights to make the sword, even better than the first. To temper it this time, he captured a lion and drove the sword into its heart, but once more the steel shattered.</i></p><p><i>The third time, with a heavy heart, for he knew beforehand what he must do to finish the blade, he worked for a hundred days and nights until it was finished. This time, he called for his wife, Nissa<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fawoiaf.westeros.org%2Findex.php%2FNissa_Nissa&amp;t=NjZhZTA1OTM1ZGI4MzliZTk2YzJkMDk5NTRjNjE2NGMyY2ZhMGE2MSxSdVpDcnl4ZA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Ayx6zQsV7n9nxh5cxFinRIg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ffortunatelylori.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F182112197071%2Fdo-you-subscribe-to-the-theory-that-jamie-is-the&amp;m=1\" title=\"Nissa Nissa\"> </a>Nissa, and asked her to bare her breast. He drove his sword into her living heart, her soul combining with the steel of the sword, creating Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes.</i></p><p>People have been speculating for years on who might be the Nissa Nissa in the story but because this isn&rsquo;t mentioned in the show, I&rsquo;m not really sure this will be paid off. However, considering Melisandre&rsquo;s obsession with blood magic and human sacrifice, I think there&rsquo;s a possibility that a candidate will arise. And in my opinion, that would probably be Mel herself. She foretold her own death in season 7 and because of the nature of her arc, the relation to fire, blood and magic I can see her as a willing human sacrifice for the glory of the prophesied hero.&nbsp;</p><p>However, since I don&rsquo;t think she is interpreting the prophecy of Azor Ahai correctly and that AA is probably not the person that will end the Long Night, I don&rsquo;t think this human sacrifice in the form of Nissa Nissa 2.0 will have an effect or at least not the desired one.&nbsp;</p><p>In the comments section of the post I linked above, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3sVGPVR6Ra7mnliy4eLYPg\">@trinuviel</a> brought forth the idea that the story of Nissa Nissa and Lightbringer is a metaphorical set of instructions on how to forge Valyrian steel. And I have to say that&rsquo;s a very intriguing idea and one that sounds very plausible to me for several reasons:&nbsp;</p><p>1. Valyrian steel swords are already magical swords and we know they are effective against the WWs. What could a burning sword do that these other swords can&rsquo;t?</p><p>2. The Valyrians were known to practice blood magic and it&rsquo;s theorized that&rsquo;s where the source of most of their power came from, including their bond with dragons.&nbsp;</p><p>3. GRRM has purposefully pointed to the mystery surrounding the forging of Valyrian steel in story several times. There must be a pretty big reason why he hasn&rsquo;t revealed how these swords are forged.&nbsp;</p><p><b>The Younger More Beautiful Queen</b></p><blockquote><p>Maggy the Frog: Oh, yes! You&rsquo;ll be queen &hellip; For a time. Then comes another. Younger. More beautiful. To cast you down and take all you hold dear.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>I believe the last time Cersei mentioned her encounter with Maggy the Frog was after Myrcella was killed. So this will be paid off in season 8.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve made the argument in the past that Sansa is the younger, more beautiful queen that will cast Cersei down and take all that she holds dear:&nbsp;</p><p><i>Sansa has been intimately involved in all of Cersei&rsquo;s tragedies even though she is not directly responsible. She was the one that carried the poison that killed Jofferey, the war with her brother is the reason why Myrcella was sent to Dorne, Jofferey&rsquo;s death leads to Tommen becoming king and eventually killing himself. And, by the end of this series, Sansa might end up as queen of the Seven Kingdoms effectively replacing Cersei. </i></p><p><i>It isn&rsquo;t that Sansa is directly responsible for what happens to Cersei but that she ends up taking everything from her in a way that no one could have predicted unless you look back at the events.&nbsp;</i></p><p>There is an aspect of this prophecy that isn&rsquo;t mentioned but I think will be paid off as well:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>\n\nAnd when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you.\n\n<br /></p></blockquote><p>I honestly have no idea why they chose not to include this in the show since it&rsquo;s part of the same conversation as the younger, more beautiful queen. They might bring it up in season 8 through another flash-back and I think that they should. Either way, I&rsquo;m pretty sure we will find out who the valonqar is.&nbsp;</p><p>I&rsquo;ve made an argument for Jaime because I think it will be a fitting end to their story and because of what Cersei told Ned about her and Jaime back in season 1:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Cersei: Jaime and I are more than brother and sister. We shared a womb. We came into this world together. We belong together.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>And by that logic &hellip; they will die together. Or at least one will be the end to the other.&nbsp;</p><p><b>The Prince that was Promised</b></p><blockquote><p>Melisandre: You should kneel before your brother. He&rsquo;s the lord&rsquo;s chosen. Born amidst salt and smoke.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>This is a dicey one because it&rsquo;s only brought up by Mel as an interchangeable title for Azor Ahai.&nbsp;</p><p>In the books, however, the PTWP is also brought up in relation to Rhaegar and his prophecy fulfilling quest. When D*ny visits the House of the Undying, she has a vision of her brother holding his infant son, Aegon, by Elia Martell and saying this:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Rhaegar: <a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aegon_Targaryen_(son_of_Rhaegar)\" title=\"Aegon Targaryen (son of Rhaegar)\">Aegon</a>. What better name for a king?<br /></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Elia: Will you make a song for him?<br /></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Rhaegar:<b>&nbsp;</b>He has a song. He is the prince that was promised, and his is the song of ice and fire.</p></blockquote><p>From what we know at this time, Rhaegar never brings up the Azor Ahai prophecy and we don&rsquo;t know that much about the PTWP. But I tend to think these two aren&rsquo;t related.&nbsp;</p><p>I believe the PTWP is Jon. His is the only story that is linked to both fire and ice. He is the literal product of the song of ice and fire (the son of a Targareyen and a Stark) and his story is connected to both ice and fire through out. He fights against Ice in the form of the White Walkers and he encounters both the false Azor Ahai (Stannis) and now D*ny, who is the person associated the most with fire in the series. If the Dance of Dragons 2.0 and dark D*ny theories become canon, his song of ice and fire would be his titular role in both these great wars that are about to visit Westeros. He also has&nbsp;&ldquo;salt and smoke&rdquo; imagery associated with his death (and subsequent resurrection).&nbsp;</p><p>So I tend to see the PTWP and AA as actually being ultimate adversaries.&nbsp;</p><p>What I&rsquo;m doubting at the moment is whether or not the show will bother differentiating between these two. I do think that by confirming Dark D*ny and the Dance of Dragons 2.0, they will essentially pay off this prophecy but I&rsquo;m not sure they&rsquo;ll signal the distinction.&nbsp;</p><p>That&rsquo;s about it on the show-included prophecies, I think.</p><p><b>Prophecies not mentioned in the show</b></p><p><b>The Last Hero</b></p><blockquote><p>\n\nLegends of the north state the last hero and his companions went in search of the children of the forest during the Long Night, thousands of years ago. The only survivor of the company after attacks from giants, wights, and Others, the last hero eventually reached the children and gained their assistance. The Night&rsquo;s Watch then formed and won the Battle for the Dawn. This ended the generation-long winter and sent the Others into retreat, possibly to the Land of Always Winter. The fate of the last hero is unknown\n\n<br /></p></blockquote><p>One could make an argument that this is not a prophecy but rather a story but because the Battle for the Dawn 2.0 is fast approaching, this story/prophecy will most likely be paid off in season 8.&nbsp;</p><p>\n\nIf anyone is destined to be the hero to save the world from the Long Night that character is Bran Stark and his story is linked to the legend of the Last Hero, who is also identified as Bran the Builder. This connection is not fully established yet but I believe the characters of the Last Hero and Bran the Builder to be one and the same.&nbsp;</p><p>Bran is the Three Eyed Raven, he&rsquo;s traveled to the Lands of Always Winter and reached the children of the forest. That&rsquo;s enough evidence for me to assume that his role in season 8 and the defeat of the WWs will pay off the Legend of the Last Hero. Incidentally, Bran the Builder is mentioned in relation to our Bran by Maester Luwin in season 1.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>We might also get a pay off for how the Wall and Winterfell were actually built although I do think part of this story will remain a mystery that will most likely be tackled in the Long Night prequel.&nbsp;</p><p><b>D*ny&rsquo;s prophecies in the House of the Undying</b></p><blockquote><p>&hellip; mother of dragons, daughter of death &hellip; <br /></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&hellip; mother of dragons, slayer of lies &hellip; <br /></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&hellip; mother of dragons, bride of fire &hellip; </p></blockquote><p>\n\nEssentially, I believe all of these will be paid off by the Dark D*ny reveal. \n\n<br /></p><blockquote><p>\n\nthree fires must you light&hellip; one for life and one for death and one to love&hellip; three mounts must you ride&hellip; one to bed and one to dread and one to love&hellip; three treasons will you know&hellip; once for blood and once for gold and once for love&hellip;&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>I think it was a huge mistake for the show not to include the 3 treasons prophecy in D*ny&rsquo;s storyline, particularly since they included Cersei&rsquo;s Younger More Beautiful Queen one. Because the three treasons prophecy works on D*ny&rsquo;s psyche much in the same way it does on Cersei&rsquo;s.&nbsp;</p><p>They both become increasingly paranoid and obsessed with these ominous predictions and are actively on the look-out for potential candidates.&nbsp;</p><p>However I think the pol!jon reveal will resolve the 3rd treason aspect of the prophecy as well as this:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>\n\nA blue flower growing from a chink in a wall of ice, filling the air with sweetness.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A great stone beast takes wing from a smoking tower, breathing shadows.</p></blockquote><p>Between the parentage reveal and Political Jon, her lover turned nephew, Jon Snow, will turn from the flower that fills the air with sweetness into the great stone beast that will oppose her.</p><p>There&rsquo;s also a case to be made that the three treasons are actually treasons D*ny commits against other people, as <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m61FcucyaOKFkj0gFLKRgJA\">@thelawyerthatwaspromised</a> has detailed on her blog. And by going to war with Jon and potentially turning her back on the fight with the WWs, D*ny would essentially become a betrayer.&nbsp;</p><p>So either way, I think we&rsquo;ll have a much clearer picture of these prophecies by the end of the show.&nbsp;</p><p><b>The dragon must have three heads</b></p><p>This is the continuation of the Rhaegar vision D*ny sees in the House of the Undying.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Rhaegar:&nbsp;\n\nHe has a song. He is the prince that was promised, and his is the song of ice and fire. <b>There must be one more. The dragon has three heads.\n\n</b></p></blockquote><p>We don&rsquo;t know much of anything about what this means or how Rhaegar thought it would link to the PTWP prophecy. I wouldn&rsquo;t have included it, to be honest, if it wasn&rsquo;t for the Crypts of Winterfell teaser and the staging of Jon/Arya/Sansa as a play on the original three heads of the dragon Aegon/Visenya/Rhaenys. In a previous <a href=\"https://fortunatelylori.tumblr.com/post/182374969101/hi-im-a-huge-jonsa-fan-and-im-against-a-targ\">post</a> I said this:&nbsp;</p><p><i>\n\nThe &ldquo;Dragon must have 3 heads&rdquo; is generally considered the reason why Rhaegar started his relationship with Lyanna and the main reason why Jon was even born. Details on this prophecy are foggy but the theory goes that at some point Rhaegar became convinced that his three children would be instrumental in saving the world and because Elia Martell was unable to bare another child after her two pregnancies, he went after teenage Lyanna Stark, thus looking to fulfill yet another prophecy: that of the Prince that was Promised whose song is the song of ice and fire. \n\n</i><br /></p><p><i>In trying to fulfill it, Rhaegar named his children after the 3 original Targs that conquered Westeros: Elia gave him an Aegon and a Rhaenys so he went in search of his Visenya. Clearly he failed, because instead of a girl, he got a boy. </i></p><p><i>However, as GRRM points out through out his story, prophecies are tricky and the more you go out of your way to fulfill them, the more blunders you&rsquo;re bound to commit. That doesn&rsquo;t mean there isn&rsquo;t some value to it but it will most likely come to pass in a way that you did not expect. </i></p><p><i>It makes you wonder just what the &ldquo;3 heads of the dragon&rdquo; might actually be about. Everyone tends to think that this prophecy is linked to the war with the WWs. However, by introducing Sansa into the mix, it changes things a bit &hellip;\n\n<br /></i></p><p><i>What if the &ldquo;Dragon must have 3 heads&rdquo; prophecy isn&rsquo;t related to the War of the Dawn at all but rather to the Dance of Dragons 2.0? Because in that war, Sansa would truly be instrumental: by making Jon a Stark, because of her political expertise and her strategic connections all over Westeros. So instead of creating the ultimate Targ team to face off against the apocalypse, Rhaegar not only brought down his father&rsquo;s dynasty and his own in Robert&rsquo;s rebellion but also created the circumstances by which, years later, his son would face off against the last scion of House Targareyen and bring about the demise of all living dragons.\n\n</i><br /></p><p>While this could simply remain something that will be inferred by the way season 8 plays out, I think there&rsquo;s a case to be made that we will actually get more insight here via flash-backs of Rhaegar/Lyanna.&nbsp;</p><p>I think it&rsquo;s also possible that through these flashbacks we will find out more about the situation surrounding the abduction of Lyanna, more insight into the year they spent in the Tower of Joy and even perhaps the name that Rhaegar whispered as he lay dying on the Trident.&nbsp;</p><p><b>The Lannister gold prophecy</b></p><blockquote><p>\n\nThe wealth of the westerlands was matched, in ancient times, with the hunger of the Freehold of Valyria for precious metals, yet there seems no evidence that the dragonlords ever made contact with the lords of the Rock, Casterly or Lannister. Septon Barth speculated on the matter, referring to a Valyrian text that has since been lost, suggesting that the Freehold&rsquo;s sorcerers foretold that the gold of Casterly Rock would destroy them.\n\n<br /></p></blockquote><p>This is a very obscure prophecy and I haven&rsquo;t seen many people discuss it. The few that I have seen talk about this link it to the Lannister&rsquo;s long lost Valyrian steel sword, Brightroar. The Valyrians, fearing this prophecy Septon Barth mentions, always refused to sell the Lannisters a sword but they managed to get their hands on one by other means:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>\n\nBrightroar came into the possession of the Lannister kings in the century before the Doom of Valyria, and it is said that the weight of gold they paid for it would have been enough to raise an army.\n\n<br /></p></blockquote><p>So people speculate that it was the purchasing of this sword that lead up to the Doom of Valyria.&nbsp;However, I don&rsquo;t really see this as a possibility because GRRM never really plays prophecies this straight.&nbsp;</p><p>However, one thing we do know is going to happen in season 8 is that Cersei will be acquiring the Golden Company, whose banner is simple golden cloth. She will also be paying for it with what can be described as Lannister gold.&nbsp;</p><p>Also since the show didn&rsquo;t include the Young Griff story line, it&rsquo;s not outside the realm of possibility that the GC is leaded by Jon Connington, one of Rhaegar&rsquo;s best buddies and also the guy who was in love with him.&nbsp;</p><p>So if let&rsquo;s say the GC would decide to join Jon&rsquo;s forces against D*ny during the Dance of Dragons, a case can be made that Lannister Gold did in fact bring about the ultimate doom of Valyria, by killing off its last real member and putting an end to the dragons.&nbsp;</p><p>Then there are a few prophecies that I believe have already been paid off.&nbsp;</p><p><b>The mummer&rsquo;s dragon</b></p><blockquote><p>A cloth dragon sways on poles amidst a cheering crowd.</p></blockquote><p>By essentially removing the Young Griff from the story line completely, I think the show has revealed that this young man is not Aegon Targareyen but a pretender whose lie, and life, D*ny will slay in the books.&nbsp;</p><p><b>The girl in grey prophecy</b></p><blockquote><p>\n\nI have seen your sister in my fires, fleeing from this marriage they have made for her. Coming here, to you. A girl in grey on a dying horse, I have seen it plain as day. It has not happened yet, but it will.\n\n<br /></p></blockquote><p>I think everyone in the Jonsa fandom can agree that the girl in grey is in effect Sansa Stark and she will flee her marriage to Harry Hardyng and join Jon at the wall.&nbsp;</p><p>The show had Sansa fleeing her marriage to Ramsay and reaching the wall where she was reunited with a recently resurrected Jon. She was also wearing grey which is I think the show&rsquo;s way of linking back to this prophecy in the books.&nbsp;</p><p><b>The Ghost of High Heart prophecies</b></p><p>In case anyone is not familiar with who the Ghost of High Heart is, she&rsquo;s&nbsp;\n\na dwarfish, albino woman who was reputed to be a woods witch in the Riverlands.&nbsp;\n\nArya&nbsp;and the brotherhood without banners camp overnight at High Heart, to meet with the ghost to hear her tell the future, and to learn the whereabouts of Beric.\n\n</p><p>She accurately predicts a few things that have happened in both books and show. In addition, there are also these:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>\n\nI dreamt of a man without a face, waiting on a bridge that swayed and swung\n\n<br /></p></blockquote><p>In the books, this is Euron hiring a Faceless Man (and potentially paying for his services with a dragon egg) to kill his brother, Balon Greyjoy, the King of the Iron Islands. In the show Euron does the deed himself, on a bridge that swayed and swung.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>\n\nI dreamt of a maid at a feast with purple serpents in her hair, venom dripping from their fangs. And later I dreamt that maid again, slaying a savage giant in a castle built of snow.<br /></p></blockquote><p>This is generally believed to be about Sansa because of the poisoned hairnet she wears in her hair that eventually kills Jofferey. I&rsquo;d argue that by ordering the death of Littlefinger in Winterfell (a castle in the North where there&rsquo;s a lot of snow), the show has paid off the later part of this prophecy.&nbsp;</p><p>She also says this directly to Arya:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>\n\nI see you. I see you, wolf child. Blood child. I thought it was the lord who smelled of death &hellip; You are cruel to come to my hill, cruel. I gorged on grief at Summerhall, I need none of yours. Begone from here, dark heart. Begone!<br /></p></blockquote><p>This could be nothing but the woman noticing Arya&rsquo;s increasing violence and tendency towards killing but because she mentions Summerhall it&rsquo;s speculated that she is referring to a future and particularly bloody event Arya will participate in. Assuming that, I would say the show has already paid that off when Arya killed off all the Freys in an act of mass murder.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a bit dubious, though, because of the fact that Lady Stoneheart has been cut from the show. It&rsquo;s likely that it will be LS that kills off the Freys in the books and the show simply gave that particular plot point to Arya.&nbsp;</p><p>That doesn&rsquo;t eliminate the possibility that the Ghost of High Heart is potentially referring to a future Summerhall-like event Arya will be involved in and if that is the case I fully expect the show to include it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And finally we have what are essentially sayings that are mentioned frequently in the show but because of their implications they act like prophecy in the sense that they foreshadow future events but not in a clear cut way.&nbsp;</p><p><b>The Long Night</b></p><blockquote><p>Melisandre: For the night is dark and full of terrors.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>This is pretty self-explanatory. We&rsquo;ve been told that when the WWs first came 8000 years ago, they brought a night and a winter that lasted a generation. So the WWs are back at it and are going to bring darkness and terror.&nbsp;</p><p>We should start preparing ourselves for at least 3 episodes of almost exclusive night time scenes. This is also supported by the actors saying that they had about 40 days worth of night time shootings which is an incredibly long time for that sort of thing.&nbsp;</p><p><b>When a Targeryen is born, the Gods flip a coin</b></p><p>This is obviously a saying that came about in reference to the Targeryens being or going mad more often than not.&nbsp;</p><p>However, at this point in the story, we have only two Targeryens left so the duality of a coin flip becomes foreshadowing for Jon and D*ny as foils.&nbsp;</p><p><b>I wish you good fortunes in the wars to come</b></p><p>This has only been uttered in show by adversaries, first in the Stannis/Mance conversation prior to Mance being burned alive and then in the Ned/Arthur Dane flashback. The third instance is in the Jon/D*ny good-bye scene. I don&rsquo;t know about anyone else but this indicated to me &hellip; Dance of Dragons 2.0.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Sansa&rsquo;s red comet prediction</b></p><blockquote><p><i>The morning of King Joffrey&rsquo;s name day dawned bright and windy, with the long tail of the great comet visible through the high scuttling clouds. Sansa was watching it from her tower window when Ser Arys Oakheart arrived to escort her down to the tourney grounds. &ldquo;What do you think it means?&rdquo; she asked him.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;<b>Glory to your betrothed</b>,&rdquo; Ser Arys answered at once. &ldquo;See how it flames across the sky today on His Grace&rsquo;s name day, as if the gods themselves had raised a banner in his honor. The smallfolk have named it King Joffrey&rsquo;s Comet.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Doubtless that was what they told Joffrey; Sansa was not so sure. &ldquo;<b>I&rsquo;ve heard servants calling it the Dragon&rsquo;s Tail.</b>&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;King Joffrey sits where <b>Aegon the Dragon</b> once sat, in the castle built by his son,&rdquo; Ser Arys said. &ldquo;<b>He is the dragon&rsquo;s heir</b> - and crimson is the color of House Lannister, another sign. This comet is sent to herald Joffrey&rsquo;s ascent to the throne, I have no doubt. It means that he will triumph over his enemies.&rdquo;</i></p></blockquote><p>Yeah, Jofferey wasn&rsquo;t and he didn&rsquo;t. If only there was a guy in this story who was the dragon&rsquo;s heir and whose birth name the show \n\n incidentally \n\nspoiled as being Aegon. Glory to that guy! And to his queen!&nbsp;</p><p>Suffice it to say I think we will get the pay off from this scene in the form of Jonsa.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Just a small addendum before I finish: A Song of Ice and Fire is littered with prophecies, prophetic dreams, cryptic messages that can be interpreted to signal future events, etc. I probably missed a lot of them. So if there&rsquo;s something you want to add here please do.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks for the ask, nonnie!</p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p>Hey, nonnie!</p>\n<p>Hmmm &hellip; very interesting question. And a multi-layered one.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Of course the show will have to pay-off the prophecies it included from the books. Then there are prophecies that were not mentioned in the show but by the nature of revealing the endgame and by being ahead of the books, the show will either pay them off or at least give heavy hints for what they might be in the books. And then there are foreshadowing elements that aren&rsquo;t really prophecies per se but serve a similar purpose in the narrative.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So let&rsquo;s get started. Warning: this will get long.&nbsp;</p>\n</p>",

Oh, and talk about how good it is that Sansa escaped.

A crime of passion, like how she nearly pushed Joffrey off the bridge, that he could believe she\u2019d do, sure.
