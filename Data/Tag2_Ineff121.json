It isn\u2019t even five in the afternoon and I\u2019m dead sober.\u201d</p><p>Or, Ezra raises questions Crowley hasn\u2019t dared ask himself in nearly a decade.</p></blockquote><p>Chapter 2 of ?<br/>Ongoing<br/>1722 words<br/>Romance/Humor</p><!-- more --><p>Crowley didn\u2019t need his instructions to know that Lucy would probably be opposed to \u2018leaving Adam unattended in a locked bookshop\u2019, but it was that or no instructions at all.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">He all but groaned in frustration as he and Ezra used sticks and branches to fish the pages out of the duck pond from the side. There was no way Crowley would ruin his snakeskin boots for pages of which he knew the contents were unsalvageable. But Ezra insisted they not pollute the park more than it already was. He had a point, but that did nothing to brighten Crowley\u2019s mood.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cThat\u2019ss the lasssst one,\u201d he mumbled. His tongue was thick and uncomfortable in his mouth after he nearly bit off the tip, courtesy of a well-placed football to the cranium that put him back to square one with his speech impediment. \u201cCan we pleasse go back to Adam now, before something happensss we both regret?\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cYes,\u201d Ezra said as he plucked the final page from the stick in Crowley\u2019s hands. \u201cI\u2019ll put these in the recycling.\u201d He gave the grocery bag they had collected the pages in a good pat. \u201cBy the way, how\u2019s your head?\u201d He asked as they walked the short distance back to the shop.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cI haven\u2019t had any complaintss.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cI mean it, dear,\u201d the shorter man said, less than amused.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Crowley shook his head. \u2018Dear\u2019? Did Ezra just call him \u2018dear\u2019?</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cI\u2019m ssure I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he mumbled as he glanced through the window of the bookshop. Adam, who was still strapped into his stroller, had decided this would have been a good moment to take a quick nap.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Ezra peered through now opened front door of the shop. \u201cOh, would you look at that. Isn\u2019t he precious?\u201d he said as he held the door open for Crowley.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">He really is, the man thought, but Ezra didn\u2019t allow him the opportunity to actually voice his reply.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cLet\u2019s see if I have any books to replace those instructions of yours,\u201d he said as he ran off into the shop, to the self-help and parenting section.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">The bookshop was old. All creaky hardwood floorboards and sturdy oak bookshelves, contrasting creamy white walls that were lined with antique, dusty light fixtures. There were at least five flights of stairs behind the till that each led to a different section of books, as well as a modest apartment. Crowley knew self-help and parenting was on the second floor, so he unclasped the sleeping Adam from his seat, carefully cradled the boy against his chest, and went up the stairs.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cFind anything?\u201d he asked.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Ezra turned around, holding a stack of books. Crowley stopped counting at five, but there were at least thrice as many of varying page counts.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cWell, yes. Each of these books has some truths and genuinely good advice in it, but there\u2019s no way one person can read all of this for two weeks of babysitting. Even marking the right pages with memos would take me days.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cMaybe it\u2019ss time for the great \u2018Aziraphale\u2019 to write a book on child care then, isn\u2019t it? Compiling the good bits?\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Ezra pouted. \u201cYou know historical novels are more of my thing, Crowley. Besides, if I used that pen name, no one would take the book seriously.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cI was kidding,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cBut you do have experience with this kind of stuff, which is why I meant to call you in the first place. I was hoping you could jusst\u2026 help me out. You know?\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cHelp you out?\u201d Ezra repeated.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cI mean, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cWell, if you don\u2019t mind seeing a lot more of me these next two weeks, I don\u2019t mind helping you out. But I really can\u2019t leave the shop alone for that long.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cThat\u2019s okay. I\u2019m sure Adam would love being here,\u201d Crowley said as he carefully ran his fingers through the boy\u2019s hair.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Ezra smiled at him. There was something about it that was unlike any other time Ezra had smiled at him before. There was a fondness in his smile. Crowley was in no way equipped to deal with this.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cYou know, I never thought I\u2019d see you doting on another human being like that,\u201d Ezra said, his soft gaze now cast at Adam, who made a face in his sleep.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cYou should have seen me with my niece. Anathema was at least as cute as Adam when she was that age, and twice as demanding.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Ezra frowned, deep in thought.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cNow that you mention it, I do remember you coming in with a little girl every once in a while. I figured out she must have been a niece later. I could have sworn she was your daughter at first.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cEz, I\u2019m thirty-two. Isn\u2019t that a little young to have a seventeen year old daughter?\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Ezra raised his hands in self-defense. \u201cNot judging.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cOkay, enough about how good I would look as a dad. I\u2019m just glad you\u2019re willing to\u2026\u201d Crowley sniffed at the air. \u201cWhat\u2019s that smell?\u201d he asked only just before Adam woke and started wailing in his ear. \u201cJesus Christ!\u201d he shrieked as he barely managed not to drop the boy.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cOh, come here. He just needs a clean diaper,\u201d Ezra said as he took the crying baby from the man\u2019s arms and rocked the boy gently as he took him into the apartment.</p><p>Crowley, on the other hand, ran down to the diaper bag downstairs and carried the whole thing up. He was in no way equipped to deal with <i>that</i>, either.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">*</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">It was around four in the afternoon by the time Ezra was feeding Adam. The boy was happily sat in Crowley\u2019s lap, who held an arm around him while he read through the manuscript of Aziraphale\u2019s next novel in his other hand as Ezra fed the child.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u2018The Nice And Accurate Vengeance Of Agnes Nutter, Witch\u2019. Agnes Nutter. The name rung a vague bell with Crowley, but for the life of him, he couldn\u2019t put his finger on why.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cThat\u2019s good, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Ezra cooed as he wiped some mashed vegetable from Adam\u2019s cheek.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cEz, I know you know you\u2019re a good writer, but would you not patronize me like that?\u201d Crowley mumbled without looking up.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cI wasn\u2019t talking to you, dear. I was talking to Adam,\u201d he said as he offered Adam another spoonful. \u201cBut thank you. It\u2019s only the first draft though. It&rsquo;s nowhere near the quality it needs to be.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">&ldquo;You always were the better storyteller between us. I mean, I don&rsquo;t know how you do it. The dialogue, the visual descriptions\u2026 I can see it all in front of me. I can&rsquo;t believe people kept records of all this. Was there really a witch that wiped a complete village off the map?&rdquo;</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Ezra chuckled, he seemed amused by Crowley\u2019s curiosity. &ldquo;Well, yes and no. Records of the Witchfinder Army showed that a woman accused of witchcraft was to be burned at the stake at 2 PM that day in 1655, while other records showed there was an explosion around that time in approximately that area that was heard as far away as Halifax. The following day, the WA goes back to the village to investigate only to find that rubble was all that remained, which was also recorded. The rest is more of an\u2026 &lsquo;educated guess&rsquo;,&rdquo; he air quoted.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Crowley mocked a gasp. &ldquo;Aziraphale? Using educated guesses to write his absolutely not fictional novel rather than researching even more dusty old records? Are you hearing this scandalous scoop, Mr. Adam?&rdquo; He leaned down to look the boy in the eye. Adam giggled. When he looked back up at Ezra, the man didn&rsquo;t seem as amused.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">&ldquo;You know I\u2019m not comfortable calling my books non-fiction. Also, might I remind you that all eyewitnesses to this event have been blown to smithereens?&rdquo;</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I was just kidding,&rdquo; Crowley said. This time, he really was.

There was no way Crowley would ruin his snakeskin boots for pages of which he knew the contents were unsalvageable. But Ezra insisted they not pollute the park more than it already was. He had a point, but that did nothing to brighten Crowley\u2019s mood.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cThat\u2019ss the lasssst one,\u201d he mumbled. His tongue was thick and uncomfortable in his mouth after he nearly bit off the tip, courtesy of a well-placed football to the cranium that put him back to square one with his speech impediment. \u201cCan we pleasse go back to Adam now, before something happensss we both regret?\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cYes,\u201d Ezra said as he plucked the final page from the stick in Crowley\u2019s hands. \u201cI\u2019ll put these in the recycling.\u201d He gave the grocery bag they had collected the pages in a good pat. \u201cBy the way, how\u2019s your head?\u201d He asked as they walked the short distance back to the shop.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cI haven\u2019t had any complaintss.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cI mean it, dear,\u201d the shorter man said, less than amused.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Crowley shook his head. \u2018Dear\u2019? Did Ezra just call him \u2018dear\u2019?</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cI\u2019m ssure I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he mumbled as he glanced through the window of the bookshop. Adam, who was still strapped into his stroller, had decided this would have been a good moment to take a quick nap.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Ezra peered through now opened front door of the shop. \u201cOh, would you look at that. Isn\u2019t he precious?\u201d he said as he held the door open for Crowley.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">He really is, the man thought, but Ezra didn\u2019t allow him the opportunity to actually voice his reply.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cLet\u2019s see if I have any books to replace those instructions of yours,\u201d he said as he ran off into the shop, to the self-help and parenting section.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">The bookshop was old. All creaky hardwood floorboards and sturdy oak bookshelves, contrasting creamy white walls that were lined with antique, dusty light fixtures. There were at least five flights of stairs behind the till that each led to a different section of books, as well as a modest apartment. Crowley knew self-help and parenting was on the second floor, so he unclasped the sleeping Adam from his seat, carefully cradled the boy against his chest, and went up the stairs.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cFind anything?\u201d he asked.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Ezra turned around, holding a stack of books. Crowley stopped counting at five, but there were at least thrice as many of varying page counts.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cWell, yes. Each of these books has some truths and genuinely good advice in it, but there\u2019s no way one person can read all of this for two weeks of babysitting. Even marking the right pages with memos would take me days.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cMaybe it\u2019ss time for the great \u2018Aziraphale\u2019 to write a book on child care then, isn\u2019t it? Compiling the good bits?\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Ezra pouted. \u201cYou know historical novels are more of my thing, Crowley. Besides, if I used that pen name, no one would take the book seriously.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cI was kidding,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cBut you do have experience with this kind of stuff, which is why I meant to call you in the first place. I was hoping you could jusst\u2026 help me out. You know?\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cHelp you out?\u201d Ezra repeated.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cI mean, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cWell, if you don\u2019t mind seeing a lot more of me these next two weeks, I don\u2019t mind helping you out. But I really can\u2019t leave the shop alone for that long.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cThat\u2019s okay. I\u2019m sure Adam would love being here,\u201d Crowley said as he carefully ran his fingers through the boy\u2019s hair.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Ezra smiled at him. There was something about it that was unlike any other time Ezra had smiled at him before. There was a fondness in his smile. Crowley was in no way equipped to deal with this.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cYou know, I never thought I\u2019d see you doting on another human being like that,\u201d Ezra said, his soft gaze now cast at Adam, who made a face in his sleep.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cYou should have seen me with my niece. Anathema was at least as cute as Adam when she was that age, and twice as demanding.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Ezra frowned, deep in thought.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cNow that you mention it, I do remember you coming in with a little girl every once in a while. I figured out she must have been a niece later. I could have sworn she was your daughter at first.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cEz, I\u2019m thirty-two. Isn\u2019t that a little young to have a seventeen year old daughter?\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Ezra raised his hands in self-defense. \u201cNot judging.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cOkay, enough about how good I would look as a dad. I\u2019m just glad you\u2019re willing to\u2026\u201d Crowley sniffed at the air. \u201cWhat\u2019s that smell?\u201d he asked only just before Adam woke and started wailing in his ear. \u201cJesus Christ!\u201d he shrieked as he barely managed not to drop the boy.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cOh, come here. He just needs a clean diaper,\u201d Ezra said as he took the crying baby from the man\u2019s arms and rocked the boy gently as he took him into the apartment.</p><p>Crowley, on the other hand, ran down to the diaper bag downstairs and carried the whole thing up. He was in no way equipped to deal with <i>that</i>, either.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">*</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">It was around four in the afternoon by the time Ezra was feeding Adam. The boy was happily sat in Crowley\u2019s lap, who held an arm around him while he read through the manuscript of Aziraphale\u2019s next novel in his other hand as Ezra fed the child.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u2018The Nice And Accurate Vengeance Of Agnes Nutter, Witch\u2019. Agnes Nutter. The name rung a vague bell with Crowley, but for the life of him, he couldn\u2019t put his finger on why.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cThat\u2019s good, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Ezra cooed as he wiped some mashed vegetable from Adam\u2019s cheek.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cEz, I know you know you\u2019re a good writer, but would you not patronize me like that?\u201d Crowley mumbled without looking up.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cI wasn\u2019t talking to you, dear. I was talking to Adam,\u201d he said as he offered Adam another spoonful. \u201cBut thank you. It\u2019s only the first draft though. It\u2019s nowhere near the quality it needs to be.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cYou always were the better storyteller between us. I mean, I don\u2019t know how you do it. The dialogue, the visual descriptions\u2026 I can see it all in front of me. I can\u2019t believe people kept records of all this. Was there really a witch that wiped a complete village off the map?\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Ezra chuckled, he seemed amused by Crowley\u2019s curiosity. \u201cWell, yes and no. Records of the Witchfinder Army showed that a woman accused of witchcraft was to be burned at the stake at 2 PM that day in 1655, while other records showed there was an explosion around that time in approximately that area that was heard as far away as Halifax. The following day, the WA goes back to the village to investigate only to find that rubble was all that remained, which was also recorded. The rest is more of an\u2026 \u2018educated guess\u2019,\u201d he air quoted.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Crowley mocked a gasp. \u201cAziraphale? Using educated guesses to write his absolutely not fictional novel rather than researching even more dusty old records? Are you hearing this scandalous scoop, Mr. Adam?\u201d He leaned down to look the boy in the eye. Adam giggled. When he looked back up at Ezra, the man didn\u2019t seem as amused.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cYou know I\u2019m not comfortable calling my books non-fiction. Also, might I remind you that all eyewitnesses to this event have been blown to smithereens?\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was just kidding,\u201d Crowley said. This time, he really was. Sorry, at least. \u201cI\u2019ll make it up to you, I promise,\u201d he thought for a minute before speaking up. \u201cAnything you want done, I\u2019ll do for you,\u201d he spoke confidently. Oh no. Should have thought a little longer on that.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Ezra seemed to put a lot of thought into his answer; his brows knitted together tightly, a pout pulled at the man\u2019s features as he bit on his lip, but eventually the other man spoke up.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cWell, if you can really envision the story like that, it would only be a small effort to make a mock up for the cover, right?

He had a point, but that did nothing to brighten Crowley\u2019s mood.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cThat\u2019ss the lasssst one,\u201d he mumbled. His tongue was thick and uncomfortable in his mouth after he nearly bit off the tip, courtesy of a well-placed football to the cranium that put him back to square one with his speech impediment. \u201cCan we pleasse go back to Adam now, before something happensss we both regret?\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cYes,\u201d Ezra said as he plucked the final page from the stick in Crowley\u2019s hands. \u201cI\u2019ll put these in the recycling.\u201d He gave the grocery bag they had collected the pages in a good pat. \u201cBy the way, how\u2019s your head?\u201d He asked as they walked the short distance back to the shop.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cI haven\u2019t had any complaintss.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cI mean it, dear,\u201d the shorter man said, less than amused.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Crowley shook his head. \u2018Dear\u2019? Did Ezra just call him \u2018dear\u2019?</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cI\u2019m ssure I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he mumbled as he glanced through the window of the bookshop. Adam, who was still strapped into his stroller, had decided this would have been a good moment to take a quick nap.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Ezra peered through now opened front door of the shop. \u201cOh, would you look at that. Isn\u2019t he precious?\u201d he said as he held the door open for Crowley.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">He really is, the man thought, but Ezra didn\u2019t allow him the opportunity to actually voice his reply.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cLet\u2019s see if I have any books to replace those instructions of yours,\u201d he said as he ran off into the shop, to the self-help and parenting section.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">The bookshop was old. All creaky hardwood floorboards and sturdy oak bookshelves, contrasting creamy white walls that were lined with antique, dusty light fixtures. There were at least five flights of stairs behind the till that each led to a different section of books, as well as a modest apartment. Crowley knew self-help and parenting was on the second floor, so he unclasped the sleeping Adam from his seat, carefully cradled the boy against his chest, and went up the stairs.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cFind anything?\u201d he asked.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Ezra turned around, holding a stack of books. Crowley stopped counting at five, but there were at least thrice as many of varying page counts.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cWell, yes. Each of these books has some truths and genuinely good advice in it, but there\u2019s no way one person can read all of this for two weeks of babysitting. Even marking the right pages with memos would take me days.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cMaybe it\u2019ss time for the great \u2018Aziraphale\u2019 to write a book on child care then, isn\u2019t it? Compiling the good bits?\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Ezra pouted. \u201cYou know historical novels are more of my thing, Crowley. Besides, if I used that pen name, no one would take the book seriously.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cI was kidding,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cBut you do have experience with this kind of stuff, which is why I meant to call you in the first place. I was hoping you could jusst\u2026 help me out. You know?\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cHelp you out?\u201d Ezra repeated.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cI mean, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cWell, if you don\u2019t mind seeing a lot more of me these next two weeks, I don\u2019t mind helping you out. But I really can\u2019t leave the shop alone for that long.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cThat\u2019s okay. I\u2019m sure Adam would love being here,\u201d Crowley said as he carefully ran his fingers through the boy\u2019s hair.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Ezra smiled at him. There was something about it that was unlike any other time Ezra had smiled at him before. There was a fondness in his smile. Crowley was in no way equipped to deal with this.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cYou know, I never thought I\u2019d see you doting on another human being like that,\u201d Ezra said, his soft gaze now cast at Adam, who made a face in his sleep.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cYou should have seen me with my niece. Anathema was at least as cute as Adam when she was that age, and twice as demanding.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Ezra frowned, deep in thought.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cNow that you mention it, I do remember you coming in with a little girl every once in a while. I figured out she must have been a niece later. I could have sworn she was your daughter at first.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cEz, I\u2019m thirty-two. Isn\u2019t that a little young to have a seventeen year old daughter?\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Ezra raised his hands in self-defense. \u201cNot judging.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cOkay, enough about how good I would look as a dad. I\u2019m just glad you\u2019re willing to\u2026\u201d Crowley sniffed at the air. \u201cWhat\u2019s that smell?\u201d he asked only just before Adam woke and started wailing in his ear. \u201cJesus Christ!\u201d he shrieked as he barely managed not to drop the boy.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cOh, come here. He just needs a clean diaper,\u201d Ezra said as he took the crying baby from the man\u2019s arms and rocked the boy gently as he took him into the apartment.</p><p>Crowley, on the other hand, ran down to the diaper bag downstairs and carried the whole thing up. He was in no way equipped to deal with <i>that</i>, either.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">*</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">It was around four in the afternoon by the time Ezra was feeding Adam.

I was talking to Adam,\u201d he said as he offered Adam another spoonful. \u201cBut thank you. It\u2019s only the first draft though. It\u2019s nowhere near the quality it needs to be.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cYou always were the better storyteller between us. I mean, I don\u2019t know how you do it. The dialogue, the visual descriptions\u2026 I can see it all in front of me. I can\u2019t believe people kept records of all this. Was there really a witch that wiped a complete village off the map?\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Ezra chuckled, he seemed amused by Crowley\u2019s curiosity. \u201cWell, yes and no. Records of the Witchfinder Army showed that a woman accused of witchcraft was to be burned at the stake at 2 PM that day in 1655, while other records showed there was an explosion around that time in approximately that area that was heard as far away as Halifax. The following day, the WA goes back to the village to investigate only to find that rubble was all that remained, which was also recorded. The rest is more of an\u2026 \u2018educated guess\u2019,\u201d he air quoted.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Crowley mocked a gasp. \u201cAziraphale? Using educated guesses to write his absolutely not fictional novel rather than researching even more dusty old records? Are you hearing this scandalous scoop, Mr. Adam?\u201d He leaned down to look the boy in the eye. Adam giggled.

I was just kidding,\u201d Crowley said. This time, he really was. Sorry, at least. \u201cI\u2019ll make it up to you, I promise,\u201d he thought for a minute before speaking up. \u201cAnything you want done, I\u2019ll do for you,\u201d he spoke confidently. Oh no. Should have thought a little longer on that.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Ezra seemed to put a lot of thought into his answer; his brows knitted together tightly, a pout pulled at the man\u2019s features as he bit on his lip, but eventually the other man spoke up.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cWell, if you can really envision the story like that, it would only be a small effort to make a mock up for the cover, right?

Winter had come to an end, and spring was finally starting to set in. Young leaves and blooms were starting to grow in the trees and shrubs in the park across from Crowley\u2019s Mayfair apartment. It was so warm, in fact, that Anthony J &ldquo;usually-so-cold-he-should-probably-get-himself-checked-out&rdquo; Crowley ventured to work without his coat and with a pair of sunglasses perched on his nose, ever the optimist.<br/></p><p>On his way to work, the marketing department at the global headquarters of a European multinational, he stopped by a coffee shop, greeted the barista, and ordered a latte for himself and for his boss before continuing on his way. </p><p>His boss, Lucy, had been a classmate of his in primary school. He had some fond memories of her. But after primary school, their friendship faded. Where Crowley failed classes left and right and was set back several years, Lucy flourished in school and exceeded every expectation. Where Crowley decided to go into the arts, Lucy studied marketing and management. And where Crowley lived alone with barely a social life to speak of, Lucy had a fianc\u00e9, a son and a seemingly endless stream of friends on top of her job. </p><p>How she did it, he had no idea. But he somehow ended up being her assistant.</p><p>\u201cMr. Crowley, so glad you decided to join us.\u201d Lucy flashed a devilish smile as she snatched one of the paper cups out of the carton the very second he came out of the elevator. Her caramel brown hair was done up in a neat bun, as per usual, and her black pantsuit looked stunning on her, as always.</p><p>\u201cGood morning to you too, Lucy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Ferguson,\u201d Lucy corrected. \u201cI know you mean well, but someone\u2019s gotta show these sharks who\u2019s boss. Besides, I don\u2019t go around calling you Anton, do I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am,\u201d Crowley said. He mocked a salute as he followed her into her office. </p><p>&lsquo;Anton&rsquo; was what Lucy had called him upon their first meeting one fateful day in the schoolyard, and it stuck to him ever since. He couldn\u2019t blame another six year old for refusing to even try and pronounce \u2018Anthony\u2019. Especially when the man himself spoke with a lisp back then. </p><p>\u201cAnything I can do for you?\u201d He asked before finally taking a sip of his coffee.</p><p>\u201cWell, there is one thing\u2026\u201d Lucy\u2014 ms. Ferguson said. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly work-related, but I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s anyone else in the world I would trust with the task.\u201d</p><p>This piqued Crowley\u2019s attention. A single brow raised over the rims of the sunglasses he had \u2018forgotten\u2019 to take off.</p><p>\u201cYou know how\u2026 particular I can be with Adam\u2019s care, right?\u201d</p><p>Oh, Crowley knew. The last year and nine months had been an Experience, so to speak. Every day, Lucy had regaled to Crowley the many things she read in books and on websites about parenting. Once the boy was finally there, she had laid down the law for everyone. Fianc\u00e9s, grandparents, friends and babysitters alike. She was strict about it, but Adam seemed to be happy and healthy. But that was Lucy: strict, diligent, and always yielding the best results.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Crowley tried simply, motioning for her to continue.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m about to offer you two weeks out of the office. All expenses covered. On the condition that you look after Adam while Belle and I are on our vacation.\u201d</p><p>As if they had become sentient with a sense for comedic timing, Crowley\u2019s sunglasses slid down his nose.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnton, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you had a babysitter!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought so too! But now she\u2019s off to Cambodia for half a year to rediscover herself after a particularly bad break up\u2026\u201d Lucy let herself fall into her office chair with an exasperated sigh. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019re really my only hope. Belle is so looking forward to this trip to Croatia, I don\u2019t want to have to tell her that we have to cancel.\u201d</p><p>Crowley thought it over for a second. Deep down, he knew he had already decided, but caring for his obscene amount of houseplants proved to be a challenge on its own. Was taking care of a human baby really a good idea?</p><p>Then again, this was Lucy. Surely she would provide clearer instructions to take care of Adam than the regular garden center would provide for a ficus. He pouted and bit the inside of his cheeks some more before finally speaking up.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll do it,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lifesaver!\u201d Lucy said as she clasped her hands together. \u201cI\u2019ll pack a bag with everything he needs and print you some instructions. Our plane leaves at three, so if you could come pick up Adam at my place at around nine in the morning, that would be ideal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Yeah, sure. I can do that,\u201d Crowley said as he tried not to imagine an instruction book the size of a George R. R. Martin novel, peppered with fine print, brightly coloured post-its and a footnote here and there. \u201cTomorrow at nine. Absolutely.\u201d He whipped out his phone to set his alarms accordingly with a quick note to \u2018PICK UP LUCY\u2019S BABY\u2019. Crowley was not used to having to be places at nine on a Saturday, but he liked to think he could do it with the right precautions.</p><p>\u201cAgain, I can\u2019t thank you enough for this.</p><p>\u201cHey, no, really, it\u2019s fine. You work really hard. You deserve a nice vacation.\u201d</p><p>Lucy smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s really sweet of you. So, the deeds of the day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! Right, deeds. There\u2019s some calls that came in after you left yesterday, I put a list of those on your desk and\u2026\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>It was Saturday, ten in the morning, and Crowley was sitting on a bench in the park across the street from his apartment. The sound of the children playing football behind him, using water bottles as improvised goalposts filled his ears. The pram containing Adam, who was covered in a reasonable amount of sunblock for the time of year, was parked securely next to him. He tried to relax and soak up some much needed sunshine, but instead he ground his teeth as he pondered for a while whether or not to also put his sunglasses on the toddler to shield his eyes. </p><p>Crowley noticed Lucy had packed the kid red and white striped pyjamas. He had briefly toyed with the idea of asking her whether or not he looked like the Goblin King to her, but quickly decided against it. He knew what Lucy was like when she was stressed, and joking about 80s movies in that situation would not have been the best idea.</p><p>He fidgeted with his fingers and ground his teeth some more. He didn&rsquo;t know the first thing about caring for a baby. He didn&rsquo;t know what the right temperature for a jar of mashed vegetables felt like. He didn&rsquo;t know how fast his patience might run out without a smoke every once in a while. He leaned his head backwards and let out an exasperated groan. Two weeks of not smoking. How had he ever agreed to this?</p><p>He gave Adam a quick glance to make sure he was entertained with his rattling teddy bear before getting out his phone, scroll through the letter A in his contacts and dial the expert.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Anathema, how are you doing?&rdquo; Crowley asked, putting on his best customer service voice. He practically heard the teen&rsquo;s mood drop.</p><p>&ldquo;Need me to help you hide another body, uncle Tony?&rdquo; Anathema asked, all business. &ldquo;Proverbially, of course.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not quite&hellip;&rdquo; He said, slowly phasing the artificial sweetener out of his tone. Anathema had the best bullshit radar in the family and it must have been blaring at full power. &ldquo;You still babysit, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you need a babysitter for?&rdquo; Anathema pushed.</p><p>&ldquo;Yesterday I promised my boss I would watch her baby while she&rsquo;s away for two weeks. And today I&rsquo;m realizing I haven&rsquo;t the slightest idea what I&rsquo;m doing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And now you want me to look after your boss&rsquo; baby so you can take all the credit when she comes home?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s within the realm of possibility, yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uncle Tony, I have classes to go to and finals to study for. Why don&rsquo;t you ask that friend of yours you had a crush on? The one with the bookshop. Whatshisface. It&rsquo;s on the tip of my tongue.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley winced when he came to the conclusion, &ldquo;Ezra? I haven&rsquo;t talked to him in months.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you best start talking to him again. He said that before he had his bookshop, he had a job at a daycare.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When did he tell you that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When I was seven and you took me to the park by his shop every weekend so you could admire him from afar. This one time you finally built up the courage to take me into his shop with the promise of a new book, which you never got me by the way, you two got talking and he just casually dropped it into the conversation. But then again, you might have been so nervous it went right over your head.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, that might have been it,&rdquo; Crowley admitted more to himself than to his niece. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give him a call. You&rsquo;re my hero, Anathema.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; the girl said. Crowley could hear the smug smirk on her face on the other end of the line. &ldquo;You can call me for some quick advice, but please know that I&rsquo;m going to be busy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Gotcha. I&rsquo;ll talk to you later then. Tell your mum I said hi.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Will do. See ya.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right. See ya,&rdquo; and he ended the call. He went back into his contacts and scrolled down to the letter E. However, he was so preoccupied with his phone that he didn\u2019t notice something, or rather someone, leaning over the backrest of the bench.</p><p>\u201cYou called?\u201d Ezra Fell, local bookshop keeper and historical non-fiction* author \u2018Aziraphale\u2019, asked with a satisfied smirk on his face.</p><p>(*This was a point of contention between Ezra and his literary agent. Where Ezra didn\u2019t feel comfortable calling his books historical \u201cnon-fiction\u201d. His novels were, after all, primarily based on vague records and nearly non-existent witness accounts. However, his agent insisted on the label, since, according to them, the very label itself would sell more copies.)</p><p>Crowley flinched, but didn\u2019t shriek. Not even a little bit. Not if you asked him, at least. \u201cWhat are you doing here?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust feeding the ducks some old oats when I heard a familiar voice say my name, so I decided to investigate,\u201d the man said as he walked around the bench to sit down next to Crowley. \u201cDid you know bread is actually really bad for ducks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Crowley said simply, shifting uncomfortably in his seat.</p><p>\u201cSo, what about the baby? Did I miss something big?\u201d Ezra asked as he tossed some oats to the ground. Ducks came rushing from the pond and Adam giggled at the sight of the waddling birds. &ldquo;I mean, I&rsquo;d assume you&rsquo;d let me know if you had a baby, somehow.&rdquo;</p><p>\u201cMy boss took her fianc\u00e9 on a vacation to Croatia, she\u2019s probably going to propose, so I\u2019m looking after their son until they come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when do you know anything about taking care of a baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. I\u2019m just generally very good at following her very particular instructions,\u201d Crowley said as he produced a stack of instructions from a bright blue diaper bag, roughly the size of The Fellowship Of The Ring. \u201cThat and she trusts me, I guess. I was actually hoping you could help me with these.\u201d</p><p>A small \u2018my goodness\u2019 escaped Ezra as he eyed the stack of loose pages. \u201cThat\u2019s all for him?\u201d He asked, pointing at Adam.</p><p>\u201cLook out, mister!\u201d A young voice called from behind them, but Crowley paid it no mind.</p><p>\u201cIt is, trust me. It\u2019s\u2014\u201d Crowley bit his tongue as a football hit him in the back of the head, knocking his shades off his face and the pages out of his hand. As luck would have it, a breeze picked up, carrying the pages away from them and into the duck pond.</p><p>Adam giggled and clapped his tiny hands.</p><p>\u201cOh dear\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck me\u2026\u201d</p><hr>",

Winter had come to an end, and spring was finally starting to set in. Young leaves and blooms were starting to grow in the trees and shrubs in the park across from Crowley\u2019s Mayfair apartment. It was so warm, in fact, that Anthony J \u201cusually-so-cold-he-should-probably-get-himself-checked-out\u201d Crowley ventured to work without his coat and with a pair of sunglasses perched on his nose, ever the optimist.<br></p><p>On his way to work, the marketing department at the global headquarters of a European multinational, he stopped by a coffee shop, greeted the barista, and ordered a latte for himself and for his boss before continuing on his way. </p><p>His boss, Lucy, had been a classmate of his in primary school. He had some fond memories of her. But after primary school, their friendship faded. Where Crowley failed classes left and right and was set back several years, Lucy flourished in school and exceeded every expectation. Where Crowley decided to go into the arts, Lucy studied marketing and management. And where Crowley lived alone with barely a social life to speak of, Lucy had a fianc\u00e9, a son and a seemingly endless stream of friends on top of her job. </p><p>How she did it, he had no idea. But he somehow ended up being her assistant.</p><p>\u201cMr. Crowley, so glad you decided to join us.\u201d Lucy flashed a devilish smile as she snatched one of the paper cups out of the carton the very second he came out of the elevator. Her caramel brown hair was done up in a neat bun, as per usual, and her black pantsuit looked stunning on her, as always.</p><p>\u201cGood morning to you too, Lucy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Ferguson,\u201d Lucy corrected. \u201cI know you mean well, but someone\u2019s gotta show these sharks who\u2019s boss. Besides, I don\u2019t go around calling you Anton, do I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am,\u201d Crowley said. He mocked a salute as he followed her into her office. </p><p>\u2018Anton\u2019 was what Lucy had called him upon their first meeting one fateful day in the schoolyard, and it stuck to him ever since. He couldn\u2019t blame another six year old for refusing to even try and pronounce \u2018Anthony\u2019. Especially when the man himself spoke with a lisp back then. </p><p>\u201cAnything I can do for you?\u201d He asked before finally taking a sip of his coffee.</p><p>\u201cWell, there is one thing\u2026\u201d Lucy\u2014 ms. Ferguson said. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly work-related, but I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s anyone else in the world I would trust with the task.\u201d</p><p>This piqued Crowley\u2019s attention. A single brow raised over the rims of the sunglasses he had \u2018forgotten\u2019 to take off.</p><p>\u201cYou know how\u2026 particular I can be with Adam\u2019s care, right?\u201d</p><p>Oh, Crowley knew. The last year and nine months had been an Experience, so to speak. Every day, Lucy had regaled to Crowley the many things she read in books and on websites about parenting. Once the boy was finally there, she had laid down the law for everyone. Fianc\u00e9s, grandparents, friends and babysitters alike. She was strict about it, but Adam seemed to be happy and healthy. But that was Lucy: strict, diligent, and always yielding the best results.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Crowley tried simply, motioning for her to continue.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m about to offer you two weeks out of the office. All expenses covered. On the condition that you look after Adam while Belle and I are on our vacation.\u201d</p><p>As if they had become sentient with a sense for comedic timing, Crowley\u2019s sunglasses slid down his nose.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnton, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you had a babysitter!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought so too! But now she\u2019s off to Cambodia for half a year to rediscover herself after a particularly bad break up\u2026\u201d Lucy let herself fall into her office chair with an exasperated sigh. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019re really my only hope. Belle is so looking forward to this trip to Croatia, I don\u2019t want to have to tell her that we have to cancel.\u201d</p><p>Crowley thought it over for a second. Deep down, he knew he had already decided, but caring for his obscene amount of houseplants proved to be a challenge on its own. Was taking care of a human baby really a good idea?</p><p>Then again, this was Lucy. Surely she would provide clearer instructions to take care of Adam than the regular garden center would provide for a ficus. He pouted and bit the inside of his cheeks some more before finally speaking up.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll do it,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lifesaver!\u201d Lucy said as she clasped her hands together. \u201cI\u2019ll pack a bag with everything he needs and print you some instructions. Our plane leaves at three, so if you could come pick up Adam at my place at around nine in the morning, that would be ideal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Yeah, sure. I can do that,\u201d Crowley said as he tried not to imagine an instruction book the size of a George R. R. Martin novel, peppered with fine print, brightly coloured post-its and a footnote here and there. \u201cTomorrow at nine. Absolutely.\u201d He whipped out his phone to set his alarms accordingly with a quick note to \u2018PICK UP LUCY\u2019S BABY\u2019. Crowley was not used to having to be places at nine on a Saturday, but he liked to think he could do it with the right precautions.</p><p>\u201cAgain, I can\u2019t thank you enough for this.</p><p>\u201cHey, no, really, it\u2019s fine. You work really hard. You deserve a nice vacation.\u201d</p><p>Lucy smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s really sweet of you. So, the deeds of the day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! Right, deeds. There\u2019s some calls that came in after you left yesterday, I put a list of those on your desk and\u2026\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>It was Saturday, ten in the morning, and Crowley was sitting on a bench in the park across the street from his apartment. The sound of the children playing football behind him, using water bottles as improvised goalposts filled his ears. The pram containing Adam, who was covered in a reasonable amount of sunblock for the time of year, was parked securely next to him. He tried to relax and soak up some much needed sunshine, but instead he ground his teeth as he pondered for a while whether or not to also put his sunglasses on the toddler to shield his eyes. </p><p>Crowley noticed Lucy had packed the kid red and white striped pyjamas.

How had he ever agreed to this?</p><p>He gave Adam a quick glance to make sure he was entertained with his rattling teddy bear before getting out his phone, scroll through the letter A in his contacts and dial the expert.</p><p>\u201cHey Anathema, how are you doing?\u201d Crowley asked, putting on his best customer service voice. He practically heard the teen\u2019s mood drop.</p><p>\u201cNeed me to help you hide another body, uncle Tony?\u201d Anathema asked, all business. \u201cProverbially, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite\u2026\u201d He said, slowly phasing the artificial sweetener out of his tone. Anathema had the best bullshit radar in the family and it must have been blaring at full power. \u201cYou still babysit, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need a babysitter for?\u201d Anathema pushed.</p><p>\u201cYesterday I promised my boss I would watch her baby while she\u2019s away for two weeks.

Winter had come to an end, and spring was finally starting to set in. Young leaves and blooms were starting to grow in the trees and shrubs in the park across from Crowley\u2019s Mayfair apartment. It was so warm, in fact, that Anthony J \u201cusually-so-cold-he-should-probably-get-himself-checked-out\u201d Crowley ventured to work without his coat and with a pair of sunglasses perched on his nose, ever the optimist.<br></p><p>On his way to work, the marketing department at the global headquarters of a European multinational, he stopped by a coffee shop, greeted the barista, and ordered a latte for himself and for his boss before continuing on his way. </p><p>His boss, Lucy, had been a classmate of his in primary school. He had some fond memories of her. But after primary school, their friendship faded. Where Crowley failed classes left and right and was set back several years, Lucy flourished in school and exceeded every expectation. Where Crowley decided to go into the arts, Lucy studied marketing and management. And where Crowley lived alone with barely a social life to speak of, Lucy had a fianc\u00e9, a son and a seemingly endless stream of friends on top of her job. </p><p>How she did it, he had no idea. But he somehow ended up being her assistant.</p><p>\u201cMr. Crowley, so glad you decided to join us.\u201d Lucy flashed a devilish smile as she snatched one of the paper cups out of the carton the very second he came out of the elevator. Her caramel brown hair was done up in a neat bun, as per usual, and her black pantsuit looked stunning on her, as always.</p><p>\u201cGood morning to you too, Lucy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Ferguson,\u201d Lucy corrected. \u201cI know you mean well, but someone\u2019s gotta show these sharks who\u2019s boss. Besides, I don\u2019t go around calling you Anton, do I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am,\u201d Crowley said. He mocked a salute as he followed her into her office. </p><p>\u2018Anton\u2019 was what Lucy had called him upon their first meeting one fateful day in the schoolyard, and it stuck to him ever since. He couldn\u2019t blame another six year old for refusing to even try and pronounce \u2018Anthony\u2019. Especially when the man himself spoke with a lisp back then. </p><p>\u201cAnything I can do for you?\u201d He asked before finally taking a sip of his coffee.</p><p>\u201cWell, there is one thing\u2026\u201d Lucy\u2014 ms. Ferguson said. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly work-related, but I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s anyone else in the world I would trust with the task.\u201d</p><p>This piqued Crowley\u2019s attention. A single brow raised over the rims of the sunglasses he had \u2018forgotten\u2019 to take off.</p><p>\u201cYou know how\u2026 particular I can be with Adam\u2019s care, right?\u201d</p><p>Oh, Crowley knew. The last year and nine months had been an Experience, so to speak. Every day, Lucy had regaled to Crowley the many things she read in books and on websites about parenting. Once the boy was finally there, she had laid down the law for everyone. Fianc\u00e9s, grandparents, friends and babysitters alike. She was strict about it, but Adam seemed to be happy and healthy. But that was Lucy: strict, diligent, and always yielding the best results.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Crowley tried simply, motioning for her to continue.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m about to offer you two weeks out of the office. All expenses covered. On the condition that you look after Adam while Belle and I are on our vacation.\u201d</p><p>As if they had become sentient with a sense for comedic timing, Crowley\u2019s sunglasses slid down his nose.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnton, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you had a babysitter!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought so too! But now she\u2019s off to Cambodia for half a year to rediscover herself after a particularly bad break up\u2026\u201d Lucy let herself fall into her office chair with an exasperated sigh. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019re really my only hope. Belle is so looking forward to this trip to Croatia, I don\u2019t want to have to tell her that we have to cancel.\u201d</p><p>Crowley thought it over for a second. Deep down, he knew he had already decided, but caring for his obscene amount of houseplants proved to be a challenge on its own. Was taking care of a human baby really a good idea?</p><p>Then again, this was Lucy. Surely she would provide clearer instructions to take care of Adam than the regular garden center would provide for a ficus. He pouted and bit the inside of his cheeks some more before finally speaking up.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll do it,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lifesaver!\u201d Lucy said as she clasped her hands together. \u201cI\u2019ll pack a bag with everything he needs and print you some instructions. Our plane leaves at three, so if you could come pick up Adam at my place at around nine in the morning, that would be ideal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Yeah, sure. I can do that,\u201d Crowley said as he tried not to imagine an instruction book the size of a George R. R. Martin novel, peppered with fine print, brightly coloured post-its and a footnote here and there. \u201cTomorrow at nine. Absolutely.\u201d He whipped out his phone to set his alarms accordingly with a quick note to \u2018PICK UP LUCY\u2019S BABY\u2019. Crowley was not used to having to be places at nine on a Saturday, but he liked to think he could do it with the right precautions.</p><p>\u201cAgain, I can\u2019t thank you enough for this.</p><p>\u201cHey, no, really, it\u2019s fine. You work really hard. You deserve a nice vacation.\u201d</p><p>Lucy smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s really sweet of you. So, the deeds of the day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! Right, deeds. There\u2019s some calls that came in after you left yesterday, I put a list of those on your desk and\u2026\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>It was Saturday, ten in the morning, and Crowley was sitting on a bench in the park across the street from his apartment. The sound of the children playing football behind him, using water bottles as improvised goalposts filled his ears. The pram containing Adam, who was covered in a reasonable amount of sunblock for the time of year, was parked securely next to him. He tried to relax and soak up some much needed sunshine, but instead he ground his teeth as he pondered for a while whether or not to also put his sunglasses on the toddler to shield his eyes. </p><p>Crowley noticed Lucy had packed the kid red and white striped pyjamas. He had briefly toyed with the idea of asking her whether or not he looked like the Goblin King to her, but quickly decided against it. He knew what Lucy was like when she was stressed, and joking about 80s movies in that situation would not have been the best idea.</p><p>He fidgeted with his fingers and ground his teeth some more. He didn\u2019t know the first thing about caring for a baby. He didn\u2019t know what the right temperature for a jar of mashed vegetables felt like. He didn\u2019t know how fast his patience might run out without a smoke every once in a while. He leaned his head backwards and let out an exasperated groan. Two weeks of not smoking. How had he ever agreed to this?</p><p>He gave Adam a quick glance to make sure he was entertained with his rattling teddy bear before getting out his phone, scroll through the letter A in his contacts and dial the expert.</p><p>\u201cHey Anathema, how are you doing?\u201d Crowley asked, putting on his best customer service voice. He practically heard the teen\u2019s mood drop.</p><p>\u201cNeed me to help you hide another body, uncle Tony?\u201d Anathema asked, all business. \u201cProverbially, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite\u2026\u201d He said, slowly phasing the artificial sweetener out of his tone. Anathema had the best bullshit radar in the family and it must have been blaring at full power. \u201cYou still babysit, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need a babysitter for?\u201d Anathema pushed.</p><p>\u201cYesterday I promised my boss I would watch her baby while she\u2019s away for two weeks. And today I\u2019m realizing I haven\u2019t the slightest idea what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now you want me to look after your boss\u2019 baby so you can take all the credit when she comes home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s within the realm of possibility, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncle Tony, I have classes to go to and finals to study for. Why don\u2019t you ask that friend of yours you had a crush on? The one with the bookshop. Whatshisface. It\u2019s on the tip of my tongue.\u201d</p><p>Crowley winced when he came to the conclusion, \u201cEzra? I haven\u2019t talked to him in months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you best start talking to him again. He said that before he had his bookshop, he had a job at a daycare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did he tell you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was seven and you took me to the park by his shop every weekend so you could admire him from afar. This one time you finally built up the courage to take me into his shop with the promise of a new book, which you never got me by the way, you two got talking and he just casually dropped it into the conversation. But then again, you might have been so nervous it went right over your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that might have been it,\u201d Crowley admitted more to himself than to his niece. \u201cI\u2019ll give him a call. You\u2019re my hero, Anathema.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d the girl said. Crowley could hear the smug smirk on her face on the other end of the line. \u201cYou can call me for some quick advice, but please know that I\u2019m going to be busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotcha. I\u2019ll talk to you later then. Tell your mum I said hi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do. See ya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. See ya,\u201d and he ended the call. He went back into his contacts and scrolled down to the letter E. However, he was so preoccupied with his phone that he didn\u2019t notice something, or rather someone, leaning over the backrest of the bench.</p><p>\u201cYou called?\u201d Ezra Fell, local bookshop keeper and historical non-fiction* author \u2018Aziraphale\u2019, asked with a satisfied smirk on his face.</p><p>(*This was a point of contention between Ezra and his literary agent. Where Ezra didn\u2019t feel comfortable calling his books historical \u201cnon-fiction\u201d. His novels were, after all, primarily based on vague records and nearly non-existent witness accounts. However, his agent insisted on the label, since, according to them, the very label itself would sell more copies.)</p><p>Crowley flinched, but didn\u2019t shriek. Not even a little bit. Not if you asked him, at least. \u201cWhat are you doing here?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust feeding the ducks some old oats when I heard a familiar voice say my name, so I decided to investigate,\u201d the man said as he walked around the bench to sit down next to Crowley. \u201cDid you know bread is actually really bad for ducks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Crowley said simply, shifting uncomfortably in his seat.</p><p>\u201cSo, what about the baby? Did I miss something big?\u201d Ezra asked as he tossed some oats to the ground. Ducks came rushing from the pond and Adam giggled at the sight of the waddling birds. \u201cI mean, I\u2019d assume you\u2019d let me know if you had a baby, somehow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy boss took her fianc\u00e9 on a vacation to Croatia, she\u2019s probably going to propose, so I\u2019m looking after their son until they come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when do you know anything about taking care of a baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. I\u2019m just generally very good at following her very particular instructions,\u201d Crowley said as he produced a stack of instructions from a bright blue diaper bag, roughly the size of The Fellowship Of The Ring. \u201cThat and she trusts me, I guess. I was actually hoping you could help me with these.\u201d</p><p>A small \u2018my goodness\u2019 escaped Ezra as he eyed the stack of loose pages. \u201cThat\u2019s all for him?\u201d He asked, pointing at Adam.</p><p>\u201cLook out, mister!\u201d A young voice called from behind them, but Crowley paid it no mind.</p><p>\u201cIt is, trust me. It\u2019s\u2014\u201d Crowley bit his tongue as a football hit him in the back of the head, knocking his shades off his face and the pages out of his hand. As luck would have it, a breeze picked up, carrying the pages away from them and into the duck pond.</p><p>Adam giggled and clapped his tiny hands.</p><p>\u201cOh dear\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck me\u2026\u201d</p><hr></p>",

Not if you asked him, at least. &ldquo;What are you doing here?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just feeding the ducks some old oats when I heard a familiar voice say my name, so I decided to investigate,&rdquo; the man said as he walked around the bench to sit down next to Crowley. &ldquo;Did you know bread is actually really bad for ducks?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Crowley said simply, shifting uncomfortably in his seat.</p><p>&ldquo;So, what about the baby? Did I miss something big?&rdquo; Ezra asked as he tossed some oats to the ground. Ducks came rushing from the pond and Adam giggled at the sight of the waddling birds. &ldquo;I mean, I&rsquo;d assume you&rsquo;d let me know if you had a baby, somehow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My boss took her fianc&eacute; on a vacation to Croatia, she&rsquo;s probably going to propose, so I&rsquo;m looking after their son until they come home.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Since when do you know anything about taking care of a baby?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m just generally very good at following her very particular instructions,&rdquo; Crowley said as he produced a stack of instructions from a bright blue diaper bag, roughly the size of The Fellowship Of The Ring. &ldquo;That and she trusts me, I guess. I was actually hoping you could help me with these.&rdquo;</p><p>A small &lsquo;my goodness&rsquo; escaped Ezra as he eyed the stack of loose pages. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all for him?&rdquo; He asked, pointing at Adam.</p><p>&ldquo;Look out, mister!&rdquo; A young voice called from behind them, but Crowley paid it no mind.</p><p>&ldquo;It is, trust me. It&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo; Crowley bit his tongue as a football hit him in the back of the head, knocking his shades off his face and the pages out of his hand. As luck would have it, a breeze picked up, carrying the pages away from them and into the duck pond.</p><p>Adam giggled and clapped his tiny hands.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh dear&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck me&hellip;&rdquo;</p><hr /></p>",
