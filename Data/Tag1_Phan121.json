I\u2019m 21 years old, a trans dude, and gay af (and single!! hello boys c:). I love makeup, art, horror, fashion, music, gaming, and old stuff (especially abandoned buildings *-*). I\u2019m a (very new) furry, too. My hobbies include snuggling my loud cat son Jack, falling back into the fnaf fandom hardcore once every year, accidentally playing Sims 4 for six hours, and bingeing entire seasons of RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race until my fear of losing my Animal Crossing villagers causes me to run to my 3DS and curse the eternal debt I\u2019ve accrued via satan who is the devil, Tom Nook.</p><p>Just so you know - I\u2019ve been diagnosed with major depression, general anxiety, &amp; OCD and I sometimes talk about those things on my blog as a way to cope and share my personal mental health journey/experiences, as I\u2019m now in therapy &amp; working with my therapist to heal. If reading stuff like that doesn\u2019t sound like your cup of tea or if, like me, you get panicky reading about that kind of stuff, I always tag those posts with whatever mental illness I\u2019m talking about, so feel free to block those tags! And if you\u2019d like me to add any tags, I absolutely will! Just let me know. ^-^</p>",

What I got from her commentary was that her impression was that the fact that they weren\u2019t uploading because they were on tour was what was causing their channels to not do as well as they could be doing statistically. I agree that nothing she said was really constructive, but, not being familiar with her, I couldn\u2019t tell if that was because she was holding back or that wasn\u2019t part of the series. To be honest, like I said originally (or at least meant to say), I found the comments to be the most interesting. </p><p>I am really glad you sent this ask though because when you mentioned Lilly Singh, I went and looked up the video in question and I had seen that video of Lilly going on about how much bigger than YouTube she was before, but never had any context. I cannot believe it was in response to a video on this channel. Why on earth did she think responding to that video was a good idea? To be completely honest, it was one of the nicer commentaries on Lilly Singh I have seen. I\u2019ve seen Jenna Marbles be more critical of her! That struck me as very childish and self-defeating, especially since I have never watched Lilly or Angelika, but had seen that footage in other videos and ended up with a pretty negative opinion of Lilly.</p><p>Anyway, back to Dan and Phil. I did notice that she was \u201chearting\u201d almost all of the comments. I thought that was something she must do to acknowledge everyone commenting on her videos, but again, I don\u2019t know. I read a lot of the comments and I did see several of them mention queerbaiting and I have said on this blog before, I don\u2019t think Dan and Phil do that. If I\u2019m being honest, there was a time when I did, and it did make me lose some respect for Dan, but that was before I understood the concept and why it can\u2019t be applied to real people and their interpersonal relationships. I think the fact that I was misinformed at one point is one of the reasons that it makes me so angry when people use the accusation of \u201cqueerbaiting\u201d as a threat to try to control Dan and Phil and try to enforce their headcanon, because it literally has the potential to harm their reputations. So on that topic, I definitely agree with you that accusations like that are big things that you should think about before you put out into the universe. I definitely thought there were a lot of comments that brought up really good or interesting points though as well. </p>",

What I got from her commentary was that her impression was that the fact that they weren\u2019t uploading because they were on tour was what was causing their channels to not do as well as they could be doing statistically. I agree that nothing she said was really constructive, but, not being familiar with her, I couldn\u2019t tell if that was because she was holding back or that wasn\u2019t part of the series. To be honest, like I said originally (or at least meant to say), I found the comments to be the most interesting. </p><p>I am really glad you sent this ask though because when you mentioned Lilly Singh, I went and looked up the video in question and I had seen that video of Lilly going on about how much bigger than YouTube she was before, but never had any context. I cannot believe it was in response to a video on this channel. Why on earth did she think responding to that video was a good idea? To be completely honest, it was one of the nicer commentaries on Lilly Singh I have seen. I\u2019ve seen Jenna Marbles be more critical of her! That struck me as very childish and self-defeating, especially since I have never watched Lilly or Angelika, but had seen that footage in other videos and ended up with a pretty negative opinion of Lilly.</p><p>Anyway, back to Dan and Phil. I did notice that she was \u201chearting\u201d almost all of the comments. I thought that was something she must do to acknowledge everyone commenting on her videos, but again, I don\u2019t know. I read a lot of the comments and I did see several of them mention queerbaiting and I have said on this blog before, I don\u2019t think Dan and Phil do that. If I\u2019m being honest, there was a time when I did, and it did make me lose some respect for Dan, but that was before I understood the concept and why it can\u2019t be applied to real people and their interpersonal relationships. I think the fact that I was misinformed at one point is one of the reasons that it makes me so angry when people use the accusation of \u201cqueerbaiting\u201d as a threat to try to control Dan and Phil and try to enforce their headcanon, because it literally has the potential to harm their reputations. So on that topic, I definitely agree with you that accusations like that are big things that you should think about before you put out into the universe. I definitely thought there were a lot of comments that brought up really good or interesting points though as well. </p>",
