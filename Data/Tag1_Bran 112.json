I guess people won\u2019t be happy about his plans&hellip;. Also on <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/8470255/chapters/42635774\">AO3</a>.</p><p>Sansa\nwondered if the war council was too big. Too many different voices could lead\nto lengthy discussions, discussions they had no time for. She had ordered hot tea\nto be prepared for Bran who was still pale as a sheet, although the sharing of\nvisions with Daenerys had been hours ago. Worry for Bran who shared so little\nof his worries gnawed at her heart.</p><!-- more --><p>Sansa surpressed\nthe anger at Daenerys that filled her. Bran had offered her visions and she had\ntaken them but had refused to learn what Bran cared about. Anger would not lead\nher anywhere though. </p><p>She had\narranged several tables in a circle, so that there would be no question of who\nled this council. She could not afford to get into a fight about status with\nDaenerys and she could not afford to bend too much to Jon\u2019s aunt. She felt like\nshe was trying to walk on a frozen lake with thin ice. Walk too slow and she\nwould break in, walk too fast and she would slip. She was glad, Ghost was at\nher feet. She did feel safer with the wolf at her side. Ghost pressed to her\nside, his warmth a constant reminder that he would protect her, that Jon would\nprotect her. Surely Ghost would know, if Jon was in danger. Sansa was tempted\nto touch her belly, but instead she pressed her thumb on the fabric of her\nsleeves, the place where she had stitched small snowflakes into the seam. It\ncalmed her. <i>I survived Littlefinger, I am\ngoing to survive Daenerys. </i>The lords came one after the other and the hall\nfilled.</p><p>Daenerys joined\nthem after she had briefly conferred with her Hand, and the tables in a circle worked\nas Sansa had intended. The dragon queen did not fight about the seating. Her\nface held a small smile that made Sansa uncomfortable and it frightened her far\nmore than the viscious remarks Daenerys had pointed at her yesterday. Tyrion looked\nhung over, but as soon as he had taken a seat he reached for his goblet. Arya\npointedly rose, when Daenerys had taken a seat and sat as far away from\nDaenerys as possible. She dragged Gendry with her. </p><p>Daenerys raised\nan eyebrow at Arya, smiling sweetly. </p><p>\u201cWho is\nthis young man?\u201d, she asked. \u201cSurely only Lords are allowed to sit in council?\u201d</p><p>Sansa shot\nArya a warning look, and thankfully Arya did not answer, although she blushed\nheavily, if in anger or embarrassment, Sansa could not have said. </p><p>\u201cGendry knows\nall about Valyrian steel,\u201d she claimed quickly. \u201cHis experience is sorely\nneeded.\u201d <i>He is a blacksmith. He must at\nleast know some things about Valyrian steel.</i> She wished Arya would have had\nthe sense not to bring him, where Daenerys could see him. To Sansa the\nsimilarity was obvious, and she had noticed that Jaime had narrowed his eyes at\nGendry, but not many people knew that Gendry was the late King Robert\u2019s son. <i>I must remember to tell everyone who knows\nto keep silent about this.</i></p><p>Bran held\nhis cup in both hands. Even covered in fur, he looked as if he was cold. And\ntired. </p><p>\u201cJon will\narrive soon, but we best start. He knows much of what I\u2019m going to say.\u201d His\nvoice sounded flat.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you\nopen the council?\u201d, Daenerys asked. </p><p>Sansa was\nabout to choose the right words to reprimand her, but Bran was faster.</p><p>\u201cIf anyone\nis here who knows more about magic than I do, I\u2019d gladly resign.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys\neyes glittered, but she held her mouth.</p><p>\u201cMake no\nmistake, the White Walkers come, and this will be our last stand. Here at\nWinterfell the fate of the world is decided.\u201d </p><p>Bran drew a\ndeep breath. \u201cI must start with what we know about our enemy. Many of you are\nfamiliar with the tales of the Long Night, but not all, and the old tales might\ngive us a clue.\u201d</p><p>Sansa felt fatigue\novercome her, when Bran told them the stories she had known since childhood.\nOld Nan had made the stories much more interesting. To hear them in Bran\u2019s\nalmost emotionless voice robbed them of their colour and vividness. Still, it\nwould not be good to fall asleep. That would really be inappropriate. She\nwondered if she should ask Maester Wolkan for something against her tiredness. It\nprobably had to do with the pregnancy.</p><p>Bran had\njust finished the story of how the children of the forest had helped the last\nhero, when Brienne entered with Jon. Sansa was wide awake in a second and stood\nimmediately. Jon closed in in quick strides and took her in his arms. Her heart\nhammered. <i>He will be so happy about the\nbaby.</i></p><p><i>We\u2019re about to be besieged and I\u2019m just happy,\nhe is here. We\u2019re on the eve of destruction, but my heart is full of joy. </i>She separated herself from his arms.\nIt would not do to show too much affection. She hoped that Daenerys had not\nseen more, than a dutiful husband greeting his wife. She could feel the blood\nrush to her face, when she saw Jon\u2019s eyes glitter and his smile that warmed her\nheart. </p><p>The other\nlords had rosen as well, Jaime Lannister had been the first. Sansa saw that he\nhad managed to block Daenerys\u2019 from seeing them. <i>Gods bless him.</i></p><p>Jon nodded\nfriendly to the Lords, and made a small gesture with his hand, and they sat\nagain. He spotted Daenerys, who had remained seated.</p><p>He gave the\nslightest indication of a bow.</p><p>\u201cAunt,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cI am glad you came to join the fight for the living.\u201d <i>I doubt she came for that, but it such a\nnice way to put that.</i></p><p>Daenerys\nstudied him for a long uncomfortable moment.</p><p>\u201cI know my\nduty to my people\u201d, she answered.</p><p>Jon took a\nseat beside Sansa. He bent down and briefly petted Ghost. When his head was\nunder the table, he rolled his eyes, so Sansa could see. She pressed her thumb\non her sleeve to keep from sniggering. When he bent back, his hand touched hers\nand he pressed it, all too shortly.</p><p>\u201cPlease\ncontinue, Bran, there is little time for exchanging pleasentries. The enemy\ncloses in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe\nchildren of the forest had a reason to help the First men the last time.\u201d Bran\npicked up his reasoning, seemingly unimpressed by the tension in the room.</p><p>Sansa\nthought she could hear that his voice was not flat like before, but somewhat\npressed.</p><p>\u201cWhen I\nwent back in time to see, I saw that the children of the Forest made the White\nWalkers.\u201d</p><p>Bran\u2019s\nstatement led to a collective outbreak of astonished questions. Sansa herself\nbarely caught herself from jumping up again.</p><p>Bran raised\na hand. \u201cThe King has it right. There is little time. Just listen, questions\ncan be asked later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe\nChildren wanted to drive off the First Men who had come with their axes and had\ncut into the forests to build their houses. They made the White Walkers as a\nweapon against the humans, but to do that, they had given them life or some\nsort of life, by misusing their water magic. The White Walkers are ice, born of\nice magic, an abomination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey do\nnot have life of their own, they syphon their life away from the children. That\nis why the children at last were so desperate that they helped us humans to\ndefeat the White Walkers. They made a pact with us humans, here at the very weirwood\nof Winterfell, where Winter fell after the Long Night. They armed the humans\nwith dragon glass, the wall was built, and the ice magic was contained, but it\nstayed on. It was in the world. The scales of the world were out of balance.\u201d </p><p>He waved to\nMaester Wolkan who put a tiny scale on the table, just in front of Bran. Bran\npulled one of the scale pans, and the other went up.</p><p>\u201cThis caused\nthe creation of fire magic, or probably more accurately the increase of fire\nmagic. The existence of the White Walkers made it possible that the Valyrians\nused fire magic.\u201d </p><p>Bran let\nthe scales swing, and they swung wildly. </p><p>\u201cThe scales\ncame to rest once more, when Valyria fell, but about fourty to fifty years ago,\nthe scales were tipped again. I\u2019ve talked with Tormund,\u2026\u201d Bran nodded briefly at\nthe wildling who sat at the table. \u201c\u2026. and he agrees that the White Walkers\ncame back around that time. Their strength has gained momentum ever since.\u201d</p><p>He tipped\nat the scales again. Sansa shuddered. She wondered what had instigated the\nWhite Walkers awakening. She looked at her brother who responded with an\nintense gaze, that seemed to say \u2018Don\u2019t ask\u2019. </p><p><i>Fifty years. That must have been the reign of\nAegon the Unlikely. Summerhall? Aegon wanted to wake dragons? And he woke ice\ninstead?</i> Sansa was\npuzzled. <i>Why does Bran keep silent about\nthis?</i> A fist of fear clutched her heart. Her eyes met Arya\u2019s, and on her\nface she saw the same puzzlement. </p><p>\u201cWhat does\nthat mean for us?\u201d Jon asked. </p><p>\u201cIt means\nthat the children want us to reduce the might of the White Walkers, so that\ntheir life force flows back into the river of life that sustains them. Our\nrecent victory has given them back more power, I can feel what they want, when\nI touch the weirwood. They want us to use fire and dragons to defeat them and\nbring the children back and enter a new pact with them.\u201d</p><p><b><i>They</i></b><i> want us\u2026. What do you want Bran?</i></p><p>Bran took\nhis time and looked them all in the eyes. \u201cIt means we have to fight the White\nWalkers and to defeat them, we have to use the dragons and the wildfire and\neverything we have. I will have to call the Kings of Winter again. Then the children\nwill come back. It means, we have to lure the White Walkers into a fiery trap,\nright here where the last hero took his stand the last time. It means, we have\nto give up Winterfell.\u201d</p>",

Worry for Bran who shared so little\nof his worries gnawed at her heart.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Sansa surpressed\nthe anger at Daenerys that filled her. Bran had offered her visions and she had\ntaken them but had refused to learn what Bran cared about. Anger would not lead\nher anywhere though. </p><p>She had\narranged several tables in a circle, so that there would be no question of who\nled this council. She could not afford to get into a fight about status with\nDaenerys and she could not afford to bend too much to Jon\u2019s aunt. She felt like\nshe was trying to walk on a frozen lake with thin ice. Walk too slow and she\nwould break in, walk too fast and she would slip. She was glad, Ghost was at\nher feet. She did feel safer with the wolf at her side. Ghost pressed to her\nside, his warmth a constant reminder that he would protect her, that Jon would\nprotect her. Surely Ghost would know, if Jon was in danger. Sansa was tempted\nto touch her belly, but instead she pressed her thumb on the fabric of her\nsleeves, the place where she had stitched small snowflakes into the seam. It\ncalmed her. <i>I survived Littlefinger, I am\ngoing to survive Daenerys. </i>The lords came one after the other and the hall\nfilled.</p><p>Daenerys joined\nthem after she had briefly conferred with her Hand, and the tables in a circle worked\nas Sansa had intended. The dragon queen did not fight about the seating. Her\nface held a small smile that made Sansa uncomfortable and it frightened her far\nmore than the viscious remarks Daenerys had pointed at her yesterday. Tyrion looked\nhung over, but as soon as he had taken a seat he reached for his goblet. Arya\npointedly rose, when Daenerys had taken a seat and sat as far away from\nDaenerys as possible. She dragged Gendry with her. </p><p>Daenerys raised\nan eyebrow at Arya, smiling sweetly. </p><p>\u201cWho is\nthis young man?\u201d, she asked. \u201cSurely only Lords are allowed to sit in council?\u201d</p><p>Sansa shot\nArya a warning look, and thankfully Arya did not answer, although she blushed\nheavily, if in anger or embarrassment, Sansa could not have said. </p><p>\u201cGendry knows\nall about Valyrian steel,\u201d she claimed quickly. \u201cHis experience is sorely\nneeded.\u201d <i>He is a blacksmith. He must at\nleast know some things about Valyrian steel.</i> She wished Arya would have had\nthe sense not to bring him, where Daenerys could see him. To Sansa the\nsimilarity was obvious, and she had noticed that Jaime had narrowed his eyes at\nGendry, but not many people knew that Gendry was the late King Robert\u2019s son. <i>I must remember to tell everyone who knows\nto keep silent about this.</i></p><p>Bran held\nhis cup in both hands. Even covered in fur, he looked as if he was cold. And\ntired. </p><p>\u201cJon will\narrive soon, but we best start. He knows much of what I\u2019m going to say.\u201d His\nvoice sounded flat.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you\nopen the council?\u201d, Daenerys asked. </p><p>Sansa was\nabout to choose the right words to reprimand her, but Bran was faster.</p><p>\u201cIf anyone\nis here who knows more about magic than I do, I\u2019d gladly resign.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys\neyes glittered, but she held her mouth.</p><p>\u201cMake no\nmistake, the White Walkers come, and this will be our last stand. Here at\nWinterfell the fate of the world is decided.\u201d </p><p>Bran drew a\ndeep breath. \u201cI must start with what we know about our enemy. Many of you are\nfamiliar with the tales of the Long Night, but not all, and the old tales might\ngive us a clue.\u201d</p><p>Sansa felt fatigue\novercome her, when Bran told them the stories she had known since childhood.\nOld Nan had made the stories much more interesting. To hear them in Bran\u2019s\nalmost emotionless voice robbed them of their colour and vividness. Still, it\nwould not be good to fall asleep. That would really be inappropriate. She\nwondered if she should ask Maester Wolkan for something against her tiredness. It\nprobably had to do with the pregnancy.</p><p>Bran had\njust finished the story of how the children of the forest had helped the last\nhero, when Brienne entered with Jon. Sansa was wide awake in a second and stood\nimmediately. Jon closed in in quick strides and took her in his arms. Her heart\nhammered. <i>He will be so happy about the\nbaby.</i></p><p><i>We\u2019re about to be besieged and I\u2019m just happy,\nhe is here. We\u2019re on the eve of destruction, but my heart is full of joy. </i>She separated herself from his arms.\nIt would not do to show too much affection. She hoped that Daenerys had not\nseen more, than a dutiful husband greeting his wife. She could feel the blood\nrush to her face, when she saw Jon\u2019s eyes glitter and his smile that warmed her\nheart. </p><p>The other\nlords had rosen as well, Jaime Lannister had been the first. Sansa saw that he\nhad managed to block Daenerys\u2019 from seeing them. <i>Gods bless him.</i></p><p>Jon nodded\nfriendly to the Lords, and made a small gesture with his hand, and they sat\nagain. He spotted Daenerys, who had remained seated.</p><p>He gave the\nslightest indication of a bow.</p><p>\u201cAunt,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cI am glad you came to join the fight for the living.\u201d <i>I doubt she came for that, but it such a\nnice way to put that.</i></p><p>Daenerys\nstudied him for a long uncomfortable moment.</p><p>\u201cI know my\nduty to my people\u201d, she answered.</p><p>Jon took a\nseat beside Sansa. He bent down and briefly petted Ghost. When his head was\nunder the table, he rolled his eyes, so Sansa could see. She pressed her thumb\non her sleeve to keep from sniggering. When he bent back, his hand touched hers\nand he pressed it, all too shortly.</p><p>\u201cPlease\ncontinue, Bran, there is little time for exchanging pleasentries. The enemy\ncloses in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe\nchildren of the forest had a reason to help the First men the last time.\u201d Bran\npicked up his reasoning, seemingly unimpressed by the tension in the room.</p><p>Sansa\nthought she could hear that his voice was not flat like before, but somewhat\npressed.</p><p>\u201cWhen I\nwent back in time to see, I saw that the children of the Forest made the White\nWalkers.\u201d</p><p>Bran\u2019s\nstatement led to a collective outbreak of astonished questions. Sansa herself\nbarely caught herself from jumping up again.</p><p>Bran raised\na hand. \u201cThe King has it right. There is little time. Just listen, questions\ncan be asked later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe\nChildren wanted to drive off the First Men who had come with their axes and had\ncut into the forests to build their houses. They made the White Walkers as a\nweapon against the humans, but to do that, they had given them life or some\nsort of life, by misusing their water magic. The White Walkers are ice, born of\nice magic, an abomination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey do\nnot have life of their own, they syphon their life away from the children. That\nis why the children at last were so desperate that they helped us humans to\ndefeat the White Walkers. They made a pact with us humans, here at the very weirwood\nof Winterfell, where Winter fell after the Long Night. They armed the humans\nwith dragon glass, the wall was built, and the ice magic was contained, but it\nstayed on. It was in the world. The scales of the world were out of balance.\u201d </p><p>He waved to\nMaester Wolkan who put a tiny scale on the table, just in front of Bran. Bran\npulled one of the scale pans, and the other went up.</p><p>\u201cThis caused\nthe creation of fire magic, or probably more accurately the increase of fire\nmagic. The existence of the White Walkers made it possible that the Valyrians\nused fire magic.\u201d </p><p>Bran let\nthe scales swing, and they swung wildly. </p><p>\u201cThe scales\ncame to rest once more, when Valyria fell, but about fourty to fifty years ago,\nthe scales were tipped again. I\u2019ve talked with Tormund,\u2026\u201d Bran nodded briefly at\nthe wildling who sat at the table. \u201c\u2026. and he agrees that the White Walkers\ncame back around that time. Their strength has gained momentum ever since.\u201d</p><p>He tipped\nat the scales again. Sansa shuddered. She wondered what had instigated the\nWhite Walkers awakening. She looked at her brother who responded with an\nintense gaze, that seemed to say \u2018Don\u2019t ask\u2019. </p><p><i>Fifty years. That must have been the reign of\nAegon the Unlikely. Summerhall? Aegon wanted to wake dragons? And he woke ice\ninstead?</i> Sansa was\npuzzled. <i>Why does Bran keep silent about\nthis?</i> A fist of fear clutched her heart. Her eyes met Arya\u2019s, and on her\nface she saw the same puzzlement. </p><p>\u201cWhat does\nthat mean for us?\u201d Jon asked. </p><p>\u201cIt means\nthat the children want us to reduce the might of the White Walkers, so that\ntheir life force flows back into the river of life that sustains them. Our\nrecent victory has given them back more power, I can feel what they want, when\nI touch the weirwood. They want us to use fire and dragons to defeat them and\nbring the children back and enter a new pact with them.\u201d</p><p><b><i>They</i></b><i> want us\u2026. What do you want Bran?</i></p><p>Bran took\nhis time and looked them all in the eyes. \u201cIt means we have to fight the White\nWalkers and to defeat them, we have to use the dragons and the wildfire and\neverything we have. I will have to call the Kings of Winter again. Then the children\nwill come back. It means, we have to lure the White Walkers into a fiery trap,\nright here where the last hero took his stand the last time. It means, we have\nto give up Winterfell.\u201d</p>",

We were given very little that wasn\u2019t set up the previous season and as many have already discussed, the trailer seems to focus on the first three episodes and the battle with the White Walkers. I know some people dismiss the importance of GOT trailers, but on the whole, they do tend to tell a cohesive story in relation to each season\u2019s narrative arc. Therefore, you can tell just as much by what is omitted from the trailer as to what is included, especially when the expected is missing.</p><p>So what was missing from the trailer that the audience expected to see, especially in light of S7?</p><h2><i>1. <b>Daenerys and her dragons missing from the White Walker battle.</b></i></h2><p>At the end of S7, Daenerys, her dragons and her army were heading North to \u201csave\u201d it from the approaching Army of the Dead. Jon (and the majority of the GA) is convinced that the dragons are key to defeating the Night King (while the dragons have the potential to be effective in thinning out the wights, the White Walkers are immune to fire). So like <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/myHfbeJjjc8bFgVOAD6sAmg\">@jonsalways</a> asked, where is Daenerys? I expected a token shot of her riding Drogon, a dragon breathing fire and destroying wights - something that demonstrated her self-appointed role as saviour of the North. Instead, we have have Daenerys arriving at Winterfell, approaching Jon in the crypts, visiting her dragons and being very pretty and apprehensive in Winterfell. Which is an odd decision, because Daenerys role in defeating the Army of the Dead is taken as canon by some viewers, so a shot of her atop Drogon is not only expected, but it gives absolutely nothing away.

Bran has spent seven seasons preparing for this moment, and while many are placing their bets of Daenerys being the key to defeating the Night King, my money is on Bran.

Bran in the first 30 seconds and Tyrion in the last 30 seconds. Considering their narrative importance, their omission from the battle with the White Walkers is pretty conspicuous. Bran has spent seven seasons preparing for this moment, and while many are placing their bets of Daenerys being the key to defeating the Night King, my money is on Bran. Therefore it makes sense to play down Bran&rsquo;s importance, only to blindside the audience with how Bran is integral in defeating the Night King.</p><p>Tyrion&rsquo;s absence from the battle is expected. He is Hand of the Queen and not expected to take up arms. But Tyrion is also absent (at least from the brief shots from the trailer) from where he is expected to be - either with Davos pacing the battlements or in the crypts with Varys. So why wasn&rsquo;t he shown? Is he no longer in Winterfell?</p><h2><i>3. <b>Where is Sansa?</b></i></h2><p>Sansa&rsquo;s absence from the battle is also expected, and while it could indicate absolutely nothing, I was surprised that Sansa wasn&rsquo;t shown waiting out the battle in the crypts with Varys (similar to her waiting out the siege of Kings Landing with Cersei in S2). Instead, they chose two shots of Sansa looking concerned - both of which followed (coincidentally I&rsquo;m sure) a Jon and Daenerys scene.</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"1\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><h2><i>4. <b>Oh Theon, where art thou?</b></i></h2><p>S7 ended with Theon on his way to rescue Yara from Euron&rsquo;s clutches. Therefore I think it&rsquo;s unlikely that he will play a part in the fight against the Army of the Dead and his absence isn&rsquo;t that odd. I tend to think that he&rsquo;ll play a bigger part in the second half of the season, so the question isn&rsquo;t why wasn&rsquo;t he featured, but what will role be after he succeeds/fails in rescuing Yara?</p></p>",
