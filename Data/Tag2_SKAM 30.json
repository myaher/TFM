It\u2019s why she said they could be friends, if he was okay with it.</i></p><p>\u2601\ufe0f <i>Second, there was definitely a mutual understanding between Sofiane and Imane that they both liked each other and were aware of their feelings. So it can\u2019t be said that Imane didn\u2019t know Sofiane liked her, and it can\u2019t be said that Sofiane didn\u2019t know that she liked him as well. However, she rejected Sofiane because she knew that their relationship wouldn\u2019t work because their values would clash a lot, and Imane wasn\u2019t okay with that at that moment, we don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll change in the future, but in <b>those</b> moments she wasn\u2019t okay with that, hence the rejections. She didn\u2019t reject him because she didn\u2019t have feelings for him, but because of her conflict between her religion and the fact that he isn\u2019t religious. Sofiane knows that\u2019s why, but for him to still reduce that to Imane being over the top or for him to not understand or care about understanding the importance behind her decision just shows that maybe their relationship wouldn\u2019t be that great anyway. </i></p><p><i>\u2601\ufe0f The scene where Imane snapped at Sofiane was because he had started dating her best friend without talking to her about it, and was pretending that everything was fine and that Imane had no reason to be so short with him, because why wouldn\u2019t she just be a joy around him after seeing him and Manon. His reaction to her attitude was a bit immature, and kind of deserved her snapping.

First, Imane rejected Sofiane because she was torn about liking a boy that just happened not to be muslim. She didn\u2019t reject him because she\u2019s this evil character that didn\u2019t care about Sofianes feelings. Imane isn\u2019t heartless. She never rejected him in a cold or rude manner. Imane doesn\u2019t owe anything to Sofiane at the end of the day. Not a date. Not a relationship. Not a friendship. But she <b>still</b> offered. It\u2019s why she said they could be friends, if he was okay with it.</i></p><p>\u2601\ufe0f <i>Second, there was definitely a mutual understanding between Sofiane and Imane that they both liked each other and were aware of their feelings. So it can\u2019t be said that Imane didn\u2019t know Sofiane liked her, and it can\u2019t be said that Sofiane didn\u2019t know that she liked him as well. However, she rejected Sofiane because she knew that their relationship wouldn\u2019t work because their values would clash a lot, and Imane wasn\u2019t okay with that at that moment, we don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll change in the future, but in <b>those</b> moments she wasn\u2019t okay with that, hence the rejections. She didn\u2019t reject him because she didn\u2019t have feelings for him, but because of her conflict between her religion and the fact that he isn\u2019t religious. Sofiane knows that\u2019s why, but for him to still reduce that to Imane being over the top or for him to not understand or care about understanding the importance behind her decision just shows that maybe their relationship wouldn\u2019t be that great anyway. </i></p><p><i>\u2601\ufe0f The scene where Imane snapped at Sofiane was because he had started dating her best friend without talking to her about it, and was pretending that everything was fine and that Imane had no reason to be so short with him, because why wouldn\u2019t she just be a joy around him after seeing him and Manon. His reaction to her attitude was a bit immature, and kind of deserved her snapping. But also it wasn\u2019t even that terrible, so let\u2019s not blow things out of proportion. </i></p><p>\u2601\ufe0f <i>Sofiane was aware Imane liked him, it\u2019s just that she was torn about being with him because of her religion. That doesn\u2019t make her, or his, feelings go away. But it was shady of Sofiane to go and date her best friend, <b>knowing</b> Manon was Imane\u2019s friend, and knowing how awkward it was going to be for the three of them. Especially since he knew there were feelings still there, it\u2019s just that Imane was having trouble acting on them. </i></p><p><i>\u2601\ufe0f The right thing to have done would\u2019ve been to have talked to Imane about him dating Manon, because of the way things were between them (Sofiane and Imane). So he fucked up because of that. And also about kissing her where he and Imane had their date. <b>But</b> no ones mad at him for actually moving on. Just uneasy because he chose Imane\u2019s best friend and didn\u2019t even talk to her about it. And then acted like everything was cool and that the reason why Imane was being so short with him was this great mystery he couldn\u2019t figure out.</i></p><p><i>\u2601\ufe0f Regarding her getting him into a fight, Imane didn\u2019t have a hand in that. She was across the road. The only one at fault for the fight is Charles. He was being invasive, and intimidating, towards Manon and he actually pushed Sofiane. So Charles came in already behaving aggressively. It\u2019s not surprising Sofiane punched him. But that choice was Sofiane\u2019s. No one asked him to do that, that was a decision he made. Imane didn\u2019t cause him to get into a fight. </i></p><p><i>\u2601\ufe0f These are the things that Imane has done wrong: Imane didn\u2019t have to block him and remove him from her life so harshly. But she made a rash decision because she was hurt and conflicted. Shit happens. Imane shouldn\u2019t have emailed Charles, or meddled with Sofianes and Manons relationship period because at the end of the day she rejected Sofiane and even though the person he moved on with wasn\u2019t the best one, that\u2019s still his relationship, and none of her business. Imane fucked up. But Sofiane has fucked up too. They\u2019re teenagers. You don\u2019t think teenagers do the wrong thing sometimes? It happened. And it\u2019ll probably happen again \ud83d\ude02 Because they\u2019re teenagers! </i></p><p>\u2601\ufe0f <i>Imane made the wrong call sometimes, for sure, but so has Sofiane. And what we\u2019re not gonna do is excuse one wrong over the other. Especially when Imane has actually <b>apologized</b> for her wrongdoings. Sofiane hasn\u2019t really brought up the fact that he chose to date Imane\u2019s best friend, specifically, so soon after they technically kind of broke up. He should\u2019ve talked to Imane about it. He knew Imane had feelings for him still. They\u2019re not terrible people, they\u2019re just teenagers, and they\u2019ve both fucked up. But it\u2019s of no use to excuse certain things just because another person fucked up.</i></p><p><i>\u2601\ufe0f Lastly, If a non muslim person who is religious won\u2019t date someone from another religion apart from their own, that\u2019s just their prerogative. That\u2019s not racist. It\u2019s what Imane is doing, and she\u2019s not being racist towards Sofiane. There are certain ordinances Imane has to do and follow, and same goes for other muslim girls. Not marrying a non muslim guy is one of them. Imane is torn because she loves Sofiane but he\u2019s not Muslim and it would\u2019ve hurt to keep him around while she still has feelings for him so she pushed him away. She went about it the wrong way, <b>we know that</b>, but she\u2019s not being racist by doing this.

Blinded by love and lust you can say. Even in the beginning, when Lucas first saw Eliott, he was starstrucked. His long frame that towered over him. Being already small would usually make Lucas feel annoyed and self conscious about his height but with Eliott? He felt so <i>tiny</i>, and it honestly turned him on a bit. Among other things. After their first kiss in the rain, he was reduced to nothing but an addict starving for more. Those lips that were so sweet against his own. And the lip bitting?? He was gone. The tongue that paved their way in and made him taste heaven. He would always find himself being distracted while looking at them, just waiting for his next kiss. His hair also was something Lucas couldn&rsquo;t resist pulling in heated moments. And his <i>HANDS</i>? God, Lucas swore he never knew someone&rsquo;s hands could be so soothing and so strong. Everytime they would hold Lucas up against the wall or brace his own hands above his head as they kissed and fucked was beyond comprehension. There&rsquo;s was honestly nothing that didn&rsquo;t turn Lucas on about Eliott. Being a horny teenager was only half the blame when your boyfriend looks like a Greek God.</p><p>Eliott on the other hand, play it more subtle. Or so others think.
