        "body": "<p>15 YEARS AGO</p><p>Jungkook sat next to Jimin on an old tree stump, watching\nhim weave a crown out of little blue flowers. The blond smiled as he presented\nit to him, trying to place it on Jungkook\u2019s head. The black-haired boy dodged\nit, and Jimin followed him, toppling them both over and they tussled on the\nground until he pinned Jimin down and put the crown on him instead. They were\nboth giggling, until Jungkook gave him a chaste kiss. The smile Jimin gave him\nwas blindingly brilliant, the last smile he ever saw on the other\u2019s face. </p><p>He felt the hard hands pulling them apart, yanking him up by\nthe hair and the back of his shirt. The rough hands tied him up as he tried to\nget back to Jimin. He could hear a loud smack, and someone yelling, he looked\nover to see Jimin cowering, tears flowing from his eyes, as the blood stained\nhis lips, and a large bruise formed on his cheek. Jungkook felt the unfamiliar\naggression rise in his body, his canines punched down into his mouth, the growl\nthat reverberated from his chest was inhuman, a dark threat. But he was still\ntoo young, too weak to overpower the adult men holding him back.</p><p>He could see the bright red of his eyes glow reflecting off\nthe trees and grass. As if in response, the bright glow of white flared from the\nother side of the clearing, reaching out to him. Their eyes met, red glow\nmeeting white, Alpha and Omega. The pack members seemed to find this amusing,\ntheir laughter and cat calls rang through the forest.</p><p>\u201cLooks like we got a little Alpha!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGonna get a good price for him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAww\u2026 Are you in love little baby?\u201d</p><p>After they were dragged back to the camp, Jungkook was\nhanded off to some rough looking men with a wheeled cart that seemed to be\nfashioned a cage. He recognized that these men were Slavers. The most abominable\nof all people, they trafficked their unwilling victims into all sorts of\nunsavory places to be used as whores, slaves, or gladiators. They hauled him up\ninto the cage and locked him inside. A tall dark-haired man, obviously the pack\nAlpha, spoke with the men and some gold exchanged hands before the Slavers\nmounted up and started to take him away.</p><p>He could see in the distance Jimin being dragged into the\nmiddle of a crowd, his shirt ripped off and his hands tied to a whipping post. Jungkook\nstruggled with every ounce of strength in his little body, trying to escape to\nno avail. The same dark man who had taken the money from the Slavers took up a\nwhip and Jungkook watched in horror as the corded leather met the pale skin of\nJimin\u2019s back, leaving a deep, bloody welt. The scream of pain that Jimin\nreleased absolutely tore Jungkook\u2019s heart out. </p><p>Completely helpless, Jungkook howled and screamed. \u201cWait for\nme! I will come for you! I promise, I will find you\u2026 I love you.\u201d</p><p>He watched the whip make five more strikes before the cart\nturned a corner and he lost sight of Jimin.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>5 YEARS LATER</p><p>Jungkook awoke with a hoarse whimper. His body jerking\nviolently as he surfaced from the nightmare, causing the thick links in the\nchain attached to his ankle to clink in the dark silence of his cell. It had\nbeen nearly 5 years since he had been sold by the Slavers to the owner of the\nfighting pits in the capitol city. He had been unable to escape; his captors\nhad always been careful to make sure to keep him chained at all times. In this\nplace, he was as good as merchandise, and they planned on protecting their\ninvestment.</p><p>At thirteen he was now old enough to enter the arena, and he\nknew they would come for him soon. He was not afraid, he had worked hard to\nbecome strong over the last few years. The masters of the fighting pits, always\nkept them well fed, they wanted the fighters to be strong. Strong fighters made\nfor interesting fights, which in turn led to more money from the betting pools\nand audience. That however did not stop them from abusing the slaves, beating\nthem for any minor offense.</p><p>He would take the opportunity to get stronger, to learn to\nfight. If he was going to find and rescue Jimin, he would probably need those\nskills. His body was no longer his own, and not because he was legally owned as\na slave; no, his body belonged to his mate, his other half, and he was driven\nby the need to protect, to shelter, to defend.

The blond smiled as he presented\nit to him, trying to place it on Jungkook\u2019s head. The black-haired boy dodged\nit, and Jimin followed him, toppling them both over and they tussled on the\nground until he pinned Jimin down and put the crown on him instead. They were\nboth giggling, until Jungkook gave him a chaste kiss. The smile Jimin gave him\nwas blindingly brilliant, the last smile he ever saw on the other\u2019s face. </p><p>He felt the hard hands pulling them apart, yanking him up by\nthe hair and the back of his shirt. The rough hands tied him up as he tried to\nget back to Jimin. He could hear a loud smack, and someone yelling, he looked\nover to see Jimin cowering, tears flowing from his eyes, as the blood stained\nhis lips, and a large bruise formed on his cheek. Jungkook felt the unfamiliar\naggression rise in his body, his canines punched down into his mouth, the growl\nthat reverberated from his chest was inhuman, a dark threat. But he was still\ntoo young, too weak to overpower the adult men holding him back.</p><p>He could see the bright red of his eyes glow reflecting off\nthe trees and grass. As if in response, the bright glow of white flared from the\nother side of the clearing, reaching out to him. Their eyes met, red glow\nmeeting white, Alpha and Omega. The pack members seemed to find this amusing,\ntheir laughter and cat calls rang through the forest.</p><p>\u201cLooks like we got a little Alpha!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGonna get a good price for him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAww\u2026 Are you in love little baby?\u201d</p><p>After they were dragged back to the camp, Jungkook was\nhanded off to some rough looking men with a wheeled cart that seemed to be\nfashioned a cage. He recognized that these men were Slavers. The most abominable\nof all people, they trafficked their unwilling victims into all sorts of\nunsavory places to be used as whores, slaves, or gladiators. They hauled him up\ninto the cage and locked him inside. A tall dark-haired man, obviously the pack\nAlpha, spoke with the men and some gold exchanged hands before the Slavers\nmounted up and started to take him away.</p><p>He could see in the distance Jimin being dragged into the\nmiddle of a crowd, his shirt ripped off and his hands tied to a whipping post. Jungkook\nstruggled with every ounce of strength in his little body, trying to escape to\nno avail. The same dark man who had taken the money from the Slavers took up a\nwhip and Jungkook watched in horror as the corded leather met the pale skin of\nJimin\u2019s back, leaving a deep, bloody welt. The scream of pain that Jimin\nreleased absolutely tore Jungkook\u2019s heart out. </p><p>Completely helpless, Jungkook howled and screamed. \u201cWait for\nme! I will come for you! I promise, I will find you\u2026 I love you.\u201d</p><p>He watched the whip make five more strikes before the cart\nturned a corner and he lost sight of Jimin.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>5 YEARS LATER</p><p>Jungkook awoke with a hoarse whimper.

He had been unable to escape; his captors\nhad always been careful to make sure to keep him chained at all times. In this\nplace, he was as good as merchandise, and they planned on protecting their\ninvestment.</p><p>At thirteen he was now old enough to enter the arena, and he\nknew they would come for him soon. He was not afraid, he had worked hard to\nbecome strong over the last few years. The masters of the fighting pits, always\nkept them well fed, they wanted the fighters to be strong.

He calmed his breath and\nmeticulously picked the red-brown flakes from his hands. He felt so cold\ninside, but he knew that he was only doing what he had to in order to survive.</p><p>As he lay alone in his cell, metal cuff chafing his ankle,\nhe felt the same old ache settle in his chest. He longed for his mate, his\nother half, and as he fell into a restless sleep he felt a single tear slip\nfrom the side of his eye and slide over his skin.</p>",
