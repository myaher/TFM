Especially with a fan base that throws tantrums so easily. </i></p><p><br /></p><p>So you&rsquo;ve said a lot of points there so I&rsquo;m gonna split up my reply to respond to the different things you&rsquo;ve touched on. I hope I don&rsquo;t come across as patronising or condescending because that isn&rsquo;t my intention but also try and have an open mind. </p><p>On coming out, the reason people would get mad is because of the way that they have been acting recently. To which in Phils words are subtle but obvious enough for us to understand that they most definitely aren&rsquo;t straight, and second to that, that they do have a romantic relationship. If it turned out that they were not, then people would absolutely have the right to be angry, as essentially they are queerbaiting/ leading us on in the fact that they are together, which most of us are incredibly invested in. </p><p>I also don&rsquo;t quite understand what you mean by possessive? In the sense that they like to hold onto content? I mean once it&rsquo;s out there, it&rsquo;s out of the hands of the creator to be at the internets mercy and that&rsquo;s just the nature of the internet. If you mean something different feel free to send me another ask.  </p><p>&lsquo;Hiatus bs&rsquo;= people being upset that the primary source of content from them isn&rsquo;t going to be reliable anymore? I feel like that&rsquo;s justified and most people are currently just joking about it/ understand that they needed to take the time out for themselves. </p><p>Okay here&rsquo;s the thing. Recently dan and Phil HAVE distanced themselves from the rest of the YouTube community. They&rsquo;re pretty much their own stand alone duo. I think the last time they really collabed with anyone is Anthony in July 2017. The people they do collab with are genuinely their friends and other influencers that see/ hear things I would hope have enough respect for the privacy that they&rsquo;ve managed to accomplish to not &lsquo;out&rsquo; them in that way. </p><p>To be honest back when they were more integrated in the ~youtube crowd~ there have been moments when people have said something that&rsquo;s been a bit ?? For example <a href=\"https://youtu.be/mVNKy9uwVtw\" target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/mVNKy9uwVtw</a> at 3:43 when Jack said that. </p><p data-npf=\"{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DmVNKy9uwVtw&amp;t=NWI0ODBhODlkZDA2OWRiMzExNWI5ZDIxZjljZDlmMTg0NTlhYjNhNixhNGM5NDUyZmY4NjRhOWZiN2NhNDQwODMzZDlkYjY0MzhkMDQ2M2I0&quot;,&quot;display_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVNKy9uwVtw&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Parties and Panels | Florida 3&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;I'm practically a 'film maker'.

Considering how private they are as people I doubt they would be extremely PDA in any other situation particularly if they know there could be other people vlogging/ able to spread gossip in any way, why would they risk it. I do think it&rsquo;s the case particularly for Dan and Phil who are still only really out as queer for those actively looking for it, so by outing &lsquo;phan&rsquo; it&rsquo;s more than just a relationship they&rsquo;re talking about. That point is kind of moot at this point in 2018 but I&rsquo;ll still include it because it&rsquo;s important. </p><p>You seem to be subjectively taking &lsquo;Phan proof shit&rsquo; as something to be taken against dan and Phil even though it seems it&rsquo;s the &lsquo;phans&rsquo; that you have a problem with. I&rsquo;m sorry that you&rsquo;ve had bad experiences with people in this fandom but that, especially in 2018, is just not the majority case. It might just be the people that you&rsquo;ve seen but most of the people on tumblr at least are pretty chill. But also usually the least popular opinions are the loudest ones BECAUSE they cause the controversy. If that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ve heard then I hope you know that not everyone is like that and it&rsquo;s only a minority. </p><p>&lsquo;A fanbase that throws tantrums so easily&rsquo; hm this phrasing sounds very condescending and I don&rsquo;t like that. I might even agree if you said that there&rsquo;s many things that we can get mad over but I suppose a lot of people just have high expectations from them just because of who they are. Honestly I don&rsquo;t think we really should bc they&rsquo;re human beings at the end of the day who make mistakes, but if they do something wrong then we call them out on it; I wouldn&rsquo;t say that&rsquo;s throwing a tantrum. If there&rsquo;s a specific example that you&rsquo;re thinking about then please enlighten me bc honestly I&rsquo;m not sure what you mean other than that. </p>",

Phil hadn\u2019t even wanted this job. He only took it because he had to, because his YouTube channel hadn\u2019t grown enough for him to afford living expenses on that alone, and days like this reminded him of how much he\u2019d rather be sat in front of his camera. None of his coworkers that he genuinely liked were working and, since he was stationed at the register (or a backup for bar, if necessary, which is <i>definitely wasn\u2019t)</i>, Phil had absolutely nothing to do. Nobody had been up to the register for twenty minutes, the store was as clean as it could be midday, and all of their equipment was clean. Never in his life did Phil think he\u2019d be wishing for something to clean, but he was a bit desperate for something to do other than stare at the door for what felt like an eternity.</p><p>It couldn\u2019t have been eternity, though, because eventually the door opened and a vaguely familiar looking boy with brown hair and brown eyes stepped through. Phil put on his customer service smile and the peppiest voice he could. \u201cHi! Welcome to Starbucks. My name\u2019s Phil. Can I get you anything?\u201d</p><p>Those brown eyes got wide suddenly, and he looked like a deer caught in headlights. It was endearing, really, and Phil\u2019s heart squeezed with sympathy at the concept of the mini-panic attack he assumed the customer was having over something as simple as ordering a coffee. \u201cO-oh.\u201d He said quietly, eyes trained directly on Phil\u2019s face in a way that was almost enough to make him uncomfortable. \u201cYou\u2019re- oh. Okay.\u201d</p><p>Phil was a little confused, but gave a soft, kind smile. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m Phil.\u201d He repeated, unsure if he just hadn\u2019t been heard before. \u201cCan I get you anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Right. Just a caramel macchiato.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright. What size?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrande.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill that be all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d A hand came up to nervously fix brown fringe. \u201cI mean, um, yes. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I get your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy what?\u201d There was surprise in the boy\u2019s voice, as if that was genuinely the last thing he\u2019d expected to hear.</p><p>\u201cYour name?\u201d Phil said, raising an eyebrow. \u201cFor the order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! Right, yeah, the order.\u201d Phil nearly laughed when the stranger\u2019s voice broke and he paused to clear his throat. \u201cMy name is Dan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright, then, Dan.\u201d Phil smiled again, quickly ringing Dan up and giving him the change. \u201cIt\u2019ll be ready in a few minutes. You can wait anywhere you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>Dan nodded. He walked away with red cheeks, seeming to try to hide in the hood of his grey, horned jacket. Phil couldn\u2019t help giggle.</p><p>\u201cLooks like someone thinks you\u2019re cute.\u201d</p><p>Phil jumped at the voice so close to his ear, only relaxing when he turned around to see his friend PJ. \u201cChrist Peej, you scared me.\u201d He huffed softly and glared at PJ as he went about putting his apron on. \u201cHe did not. I think he was just nervous.\u201d</p><p>PJ gave Phil a look that Phil didn\u2019t quite understand. \u201cPhil, you\u2019re literally the blindest person I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d PJ quit speaking as Dan came backup to the counter, hastily grabbing his drink before practically bolting out the door. \u201cSee? That is <i>not </i>just nervous. That\u2019s\u2026 dare I say lust?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually shut up.\u201d Phil rolled his eyes again. \u201cI have work to do. Go away.\u201d</p><p>PJ looked around the store, which only had one person in it, and gave Phil another look. \u201cWhatever you say, mate.\u201d </p>\n<br/><p>A few weeks later, Phil was working bar when he saw a familiar grey hoodie with little horns on it, and a few minutes later, Phil was holding a sticker for a grande caramel macchiato with the name \u2018Dan\u2019 on it.</p><p>So, like anybody would, Phil slapped the sticker onto a venti cup.</p><p>\u201cCaramel macchiato for Dan.\u201d</p><p>Moments later, Dan popped into view in front of the counter and Phil held the out the drink.</p><p>Dan\u2019s face twisted in confusion, glancing between Phil and the cup for a moment. \u201cI ordered-\u201d</p><p>Phil shushed him quietly, pushing the cup into his hand and winking. \u201cI won\u2019t tell if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Before Phil turned around, he saw Dan\u2019s cheeks turn the same pretty shade of red they did the first time they met, and he spent the rest of his shift with a grin that he refused to explain to his coworkers. <br/><br/><br/></p><p>The next time Dan came into the store while Phil was working, Phil was at the register again. \u201cDan!\u201d He said happily after the man in front of Dan moved away. \u201cAnother caramel macchiato or are you feeling like you wanna shake it up?\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s lips curled up into a soft smile. \u201cI dunno. If I were to shake it up, what would you suggest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m personally actually partial to caramel macchiatos, but white mochas are pretty good too, if you\u2019ve got a sweet tooth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d Dan asked, a twinkle in his eye that Phil was afraid to question.</p><p>\u201cHave a sweet tooth? Definitely. I\u2019m one of those weirdos who can eat a whole bag of marshmallows on its own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuly noted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019ll it be, then?\u201d Phil asked, because there was a line behind Dan and he couldn\u2019t keep talking even though part of him really wanted to.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stick with my caramel macchiato for now.\u201d <br/><br/><br/></p><p>It was dead again, and Phil wa working bar. He\u2019d cleaned twice in the past two hours between the few drinks he\u2019d had to make, just because he had nothing else to do, and he was on the verge of doing it again when the door opened and Dan walked in. He ordered another grande caramel macchiato, Phil made it in a venti cup again, and when Phil handed it to Dan, he gave a secretive wink.</p><p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t have to do that, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s cheeks tinted a nice shade of pink and Phil\u2019s heart felt warm. Dan had been coming into the store a lot more recently. Phil joked about it being because he knew that Phil would give him a venti instead of a grande, but the way Dan smiled when he said the joke made Phil almost certain that that wasn\u2019t true. If Dan was coming for the coffee, he\u2019d be smiling at his cup like that, not at Phil. At least, that\u2019s what PJ had told him.</p><p>\u201cWhat time do you get off?\u201d</p><p>The question fell off of Dan\u2019s tongue so quickly that Phil had trouble understanding it at first. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in, like, a weird way, I just\u2026\u201d Dan bit his lip, glancing around nervously. There were only a few people in the store, and Dan seemed determined to make sure that none of them were staring before he continued. \u201cFigured I should buy you a coffee. You know, to repay you for all the free upgrades you\u2019ve given me.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cI actually get free coffee at the end of my shifts. It\u2019s a perk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I might have to start working here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not even the best part. We get Spotify premium for free, too.\u201d Phil grinned, tongue poking out between his teeth as he glanced at the clock. \u201cI get off in thirty minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring you another macchiato, addict.\u201d <br/><br/><br/></p><p>A little over thirty minutes later, Phil was walking toward Dan\u2019s table with two macchiatos in his hands. \u201cHere.\u201d He set one down by Dan and then sat in the seat across from him.</p><p>It was weird, being with Dan like this. It felt somehow more intimate now that there wasn\u2019t a bar between them - now that it wasn\u2019t part of Phil\u2019s job, but part of his free time. Part of his life instead of just his work.</p><p>\u201cOh, you were serious.\u201d Dan let out a nervous laugh and wrapped his hands around the cup as if it was some sort of security blanket. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>It was quiet for a few moments, verging on awkward.</p><p>\u201cI have a confession.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Phil\u2019s hands were clammy suddenly, his heart racing. What sort of confession could Dan have to tell someone he saw a couple times a week at most, someone he\u2019d only talked to for a maximum of twenty minutes at a time?</p><p>\u201cI watch your YouTube videos.\u201d Dan\u2019s face was rapidly turning red.</p><p>\u2018Oh, God, I thought you were about to tell me you murdered someone or something.\u201d Phil\u2019s entire body relaxed and he let out a shaky breath. \u201cJesus. That\u2019s so much better than what I was thinking. You could\u2019ve opened with that. I feel like that\u2019s not a good enough reason to use the word \u2018confession\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes it is!\u2019 Dan squeaked, huffing. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow? You just found my videos, right? That\u2019s not weird. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re a stalker or something.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s face just got redder.</p><p>\u201cOh my god. Are you a stalker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I mean, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Dan huffed again and hid his face in his hands, sinking back into his chair. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching your videos for, like, four years. I knew you lived in Manchester, I just- I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d run into you. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d work at the first bloody Starbucks I went to after coming here for uni.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been watching me for that long?\u201d Phil\u2019s voice was full of shock, and that was the only thing he could focus in on, honestly. Four years? That was almost as long as he\u2019d been making videos, probably longer than he\u2019d really considered YouTube a career.</p><p>\u201cWell- yeah. I just felt like I had to tell you. I was - I mean, I <i>am </i>- such a big fan of you. It felt weird talking to you without you knowing that. Like I was lying to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 sweet.\u201d Phil smiled softly, moving his foot forward to bump Dan\u2019s leg. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anybody liked me that much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. You\u2019re just so creative and cool and it\u2019s like-\u201d Dan seemed to have to force himself to shut up, head shaking a little. \u201cSorry. Yeah. I do, though, really. You\u2019re the person who inspired me to start my channel, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. You replied to me on twitter two years ago. I replied to something you tweeted basically saying that I wished I could be a YouTuber like you and you told me to just do it, so\u2026 I did. I\u2019m glad I did, too. I love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, you have a channel too? What is it?\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s nose scrunched up a little. \u201cUm.. it\u2019s danisnotonfire. Cringey, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s cool.\u201d Phil smiled brightly, leaning into the table with excited eyes. \u201cWe should totally do some collab videos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Dan\u2019s entire body perked up. \u201cYou\u2019d do that with me?\u201d <br/></p><p>\u201cOf course!

I don\u2019t think a cute twink is the worst branding I could have.\u201d</p><p>Dan choked on his coffee. \u201cRight.

Phil hadn\u2019t even wanted this job. He only took it because he had to, because his YouTube channel hadn\u2019t grown enough for him to afford living expenses on that alone, and days like this reminded him of how much he\u2019d rather be sat in front of his camera. None of his coworkers that he genuinely liked were working and, since he was stationed at the register (or a backup for bar, if necessary, which is <i>definitely wasn\u2019t)</i>, Phil had absolutely nothing to do. Nobody had been up to the register for twenty minutes, the store was as clean as it could be midday, and all of their equipment was clean. Never in his life did Phil think he\u2019d be wishing for something to clean, but he was a bit desperate for something to do other than stare at the door for what felt like an eternity.</p><p>It couldn\u2019t have been eternity, though, because eventually the door opened and a vaguely familiar looking boy with brown hair and brown eyes stepped through. Phil put on his customer service smile and the peppiest voice he could. \u201cHi! Welcome to Starbucks. My name\u2019s Phil. Can I get you anything?\u201d</p><p>Those brown eyes got wide suddenly, and he looked like a deer caught in headlights. It was endearing, really, and Phil\u2019s heart squeezed with sympathy at the concept of the mini-panic attack he assumed the customer was having over something as simple as ordering a coffee. \u201cO-oh.\u201d He said quietly, eyes trained directly on Phil\u2019s face in a way that was almost enough to make him uncomfortable. \u201cYou\u2019re- oh. Okay.\u201d</p><p>Phil was a little confused, but gave a soft, kind smile. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m Phil.\u201d He repeated, unsure if he just hadn\u2019t been heard before. \u201cCan I get you anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Right. Just a caramel macchiato.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright. What size?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrande.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill that be all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d A hand came up to nervously fix brown fringe. \u201cI mean, um, yes. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I get your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy what?\u201d There was surprise in the boy\u2019s voice, as if that was genuinely the last thing he\u2019d expected to hear.</p><p>\u201cYour name?\u201d Phil said, raising an eyebrow. \u201cFor the order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! Right, yeah, the order.\u201d Phil nearly laughed when the stranger\u2019s voice broke and he paused to clear his throat. \u201cMy name is Dan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright, then, Dan.\u201d Phil smiled again, quickly ringing Dan up and giving him the change. \u201cIt\u2019ll be ready in a few minutes. You can wait anywhere you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>Dan nodded. He walked away with red cheeks, seeming to try to hide in the hood of his grey, horned jacket. Phil couldn\u2019t help giggle.</p><p>\u201cLooks like someone thinks you\u2019re cute.\u201d</p><p>Phil jumped at the voice so close to his ear, only relaxing when he turned around to see his friend PJ. \u201cChrist Peej, you scared me.\u201d He huffed softly and glared at PJ as he went about putting his apron on. \u201cHe did not. I think he was just nervous.\u201d</p><p>PJ gave Phil a look that Phil didn\u2019t quite understand. \u201cPhil, you\u2019re literally the blindest person I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d PJ quit speaking as Dan came backup to the counter, hastily grabbing his drink before practically bolting out the door. \u201cSee? That is <i>not </i>just nervous. That\u2019s\u2026 dare I say lust?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually shut up.\u201d Phil rolled his eyes again. \u201cI have work to do. Go away.\u201d</p><p>PJ looked around the store, which only had one person in it, and gave Phil another look. \u201cWhatever you say, mate.\u201d </p>\n<br><p>A few weeks later, Phil was working bar when he saw a familiar grey hoodie with little horns on it, and a few minutes later, Phil was holding a sticker for a grande caramel macchiato with the name \u2018Dan\u2019 on it.</p><p>So, like anybody would, Phil slapped the sticker onto a venti cup.</p><p>\u201cCaramel macchiato for Dan.\u201d</p><p>Moments later, Dan popped into view in front of the counter and Phil held the out the drink.</p><p>Dan\u2019s face twisted in confusion, glancing between Phil and the cup for a moment. \u201cI ordered-\u201d</p><p>Phil shushed him quietly, pushing the cup into his hand and winking. \u201cI won\u2019t tell if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Before Phil turned around, he saw Dan\u2019s cheeks turn the same pretty shade of red they did the first time they met, and he spent the rest of his shift with a grin that he refused to explain to his coworkers. <br><br><br></p><p>The next time Dan came into the store while Phil was working, Phil was at the register again. \u201cDan!\u201d He said happily after the man in front of Dan moved away. \u201cAnother caramel macchiato or are you feeling like you wanna shake it up?\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s lips curled up into a soft smile. \u201cI dunno. If I were to shake it up, what would you suggest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m personally actually partial to caramel macchiatos, but white mochas are pretty good too, if you\u2019ve got a sweet tooth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d Dan asked, a twinkle in his eye that Phil was afraid to question.</p><p>\u201cHave a sweet tooth? Definitely. I\u2019m one of those weirdos who can eat a whole bag of marshmallows on its own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuly noted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019ll it be, then?\u201d Phil asked, because there was a line behind Dan and he couldn\u2019t keep talking even though part of him really wanted to.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stick with my caramel macchiato for now.\u201d <br><br><br></p><p>It was dead again, and Phil wa working bar. He\u2019d cleaned twice in the past two hours between the few drinks he\u2019d had to make, just because he had nothing else to do, and he was on the verge of doing it again when the door opened and Dan walked in. He ordered another grande caramel macchiato, Phil made it in a venti cup again, and when Phil handed it to Dan, he gave a secretive wink.</p><p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t have to do that, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s cheeks tinted a nice shade of pink and Phil\u2019s heart felt warm. Dan had been coming into the store a lot more recently. Phil joked about it being because he knew that Phil would give him a venti instead of a grande, but the way Dan smiled when he said the joke made Phil almost certain that that wasn\u2019t true. If Dan was coming for the coffee, he\u2019d be smiling at his cup like that, not at Phil. At least, that\u2019s what PJ had told him.</p><p>\u201cWhat time do you get off?\u201d</p><p>The question fell off of Dan\u2019s tongue so quickly that Phil had trouble understanding it at first. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in, like, a weird way, I just\u2026\u201d Dan bit his lip, glancing around nervously. There were only a few people in the store, and Dan seemed determined to make sure that none of them were staring before he continued. \u201cFigured I should buy you a coffee. You know, to repay you for all the free upgrades you\u2019ve given me.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cI actually get free coffee at the end of my shifts. It\u2019s a perk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I might have to start working here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not even the best part. We get Spotify premium for free, too.\u201d Phil grinned, tongue poking out between his teeth as he glanced at the clock. \u201cI get off in thirty minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring you another macchiato, addict.\u201d <br><br><br></p><p>A little over thirty minutes later, Phil was walking toward Dan\u2019s table with two macchiatos in his hands. \u201cHere.\u201d He set one down by Dan and then sat in the seat across from him.</p><p>It was weird, being with Dan like this. It felt somehow more intimate now that there wasn\u2019t a bar between them - now that it wasn\u2019t part of Phil\u2019s job, but part of his free time. Part of his life instead of just his work.</p><p>\u201cOh, you were serious.\u201d Dan let out a nervous laugh and wrapped his hands around the cup as if it was some sort of security blanket. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>It was quiet for a few moments, verging on awkward.</p><p>\u201cI have a confession.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Phil\u2019s hands were clammy suddenly, his heart racing. What sort of confession could Dan have to tell someone he saw a couple times a week at most, someone he\u2019d only talked to for a maximum of twenty minutes at a time?</p><p>\u201cI watch your YouTube videos.\u201d Dan\u2019s face was rapidly turning red.</p><p>\u2018Oh, God, I thought you were about to tell me you murdered someone or something.\u201d Phil\u2019s entire body relaxed and he let out a shaky breath. \u201cJesus. That\u2019s so much better than what I was thinking. You could\u2019ve opened with that. I feel like that\u2019s not a good enough reason to use the word \u2018confession\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes it is!\u2019 Dan squeaked, huffing. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow? You just found my videos, right? That\u2019s not weird. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re a stalker or something.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s face just got redder.</p><p>\u201cOh my god. Are you a stalker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I mean, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Dan huffed again and hid his face in his hands, sinking back into his chair. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching your videos for, like, four years. I knew you lived in Manchester, I just- I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d run into you. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d work at the first bloody Starbucks I went to after coming here for uni.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been watching me for that long?\u201d Phil\u2019s voice was full of shock, and that was the only thing he could focus in on, honestly. Four years? That was almost as long as he\u2019d been making videos, probably longer than he\u2019d really considered YouTube a career.</p><p>\u201cWell- yeah. I just felt like I had to tell you. I was - I mean, I <i>am </i>- such a big fan of you. It felt weird talking to you without you knowing that. Like I was lying to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 sweet.\u201d Phil smiled softly, moving his foot forward to bump Dan\u2019s leg. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anybody liked me that much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. You\u2019re just so creative and cool and it\u2019s like-\u201d Dan seemed to have to force himself to shut up, head shaking a little. \u201cSorry. Yeah. I do, though, really. You\u2019re the person who inspired me to start my channel, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. You replied to me on twitter two years ago. I replied to something you tweeted basically saying that I wished I could be a YouTuber like you and you told me to just do it, so\u2026 I did. I\u2019m glad I did, too. I love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, you have a channel too? What is it?\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s nose scrunched up a little. \u201cUm.. it\u2019s danisnotonfire. Cringey, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s cool.\u201d Phil smiled brightly, leaning into the table with excited eyes. \u201cWe should totally do some collab videos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Dan\u2019s entire body perked up. \u201cYou\u2019d do that with me?\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cOf course! I\u2019ve given you enough free coffee that I thought that was clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat- what would we even do?\u201d</p><p>Phil thought for a moment. \u201cWe could just do some simple q-and-a videos. Ask our followers to send stuff in and do one for each of our channels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI liked that.\u201d Dan smiled softly. \u201cWe have to have matching names of some sort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, definitely. What\u2019s yours gonna be?\u201d</p><p>Dan grinned. \u201cAmazing Dan.\u201d</p><p>Phil laughed. \u201cWow. Are you stealing my branding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could be that cool.\u201d Dan rolled his eyes, speaking again before Phil had the chance to interrupt. \u201cWhat\u2019s yours?\u2019</p><p>Phil thought for a moment, The answer was so obvious, but when it came to him, his face must have lit up because suddenly Dan was leaning forward like the answer was the most important thing in the world.</p><p>\u201cPhil is not on fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re stealing my brand now, too?\u201d Dan laughed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only fair.\u201c</p><p>\u201cI guess so. I can\u2019t complain, though. I get the sexy emo branding. You\u2019re stuck with edgy jokes and llamas. Also placentas and sometimes Delia Smith.\u201d</p><p>Phil laughed. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ve got to watch your videos.\u201d His tongue found its way between his teeth again, and he didn\u2019t miss the way Dan\u2019s eyes tracked it. \u201cI\u2019m not mad about it, either. I don\u2019t think a cute twink is the worst branding I could have.\u201d</p><p>Dan choked on his coffee. \u201cRight. Okay.\u201d His cheeks were red and his voice was high. \u201cI should, um\u2026 I should get going. I have school and stuff.\u201d</p><p>Phil smirked as Dan shuffled out of his seat.</p><p>\u201cAlright, I guess. I\u2019ll see you later, Danisnotonfire.\u201d</p><p>Dan rolled his eyes, but his smile was fond. \u201cShut up.

Phil hadn\u2019t even wanted this job. He only took it because he had to, because his YouTube channel hadn\u2019t grown enough for him to afford living expenses on that alone, and days like this reminded him of how much he\u2019d rather be sat in front of his camera. None of his coworkers that he genuinely liked were working and, since he was stationed at the register (or a backup for bar, if necessary, which is <i>definitely wasn\u2019t)</i>, Phil had absolutely nothing to do. Nobody had been up to the register for twenty minutes, the store was as clean as it could be midday, and all of their equipment was clean. Never in his life did Phil think he\u2019d be wishing for something to clean, but he was a bit desperate for something to do other than stare at the door for what felt like an eternity.</p><p>It couldn\u2019t have been eternity, though, because eventually the door opened and a vaguely familiar looking boy with brown hair and brown eyes stepped through. Phil put on his customer service smile and the peppiest voice he could. \u201cHi! Welcome to Starbucks. My name\u2019s Phil. Can I get you anything?\u201d</p><p>Those brown eyes got wide suddenly, and he looked like a deer caught in headlights. It was endearing, really, and Phil\u2019s heart squeezed with sympathy at the concept of the mini-panic attack he assumed the customer was having over something as simple as ordering a coffee. \u201cO-oh.\u201d He said quietly, eyes trained directly on Phil\u2019s face in a way that was almost enough to make him uncomfortable. \u201cYou\u2019re- oh. Okay.\u201d</p><p>Phil was a little confused, but gave a soft, kind smile. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m Phil.\u201d He repeated, unsure if he just hadn\u2019t been heard before. \u201cCan I get you anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Right. Just a caramel macchiato.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright. What size?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrande.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill that be all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d A hand came up to nervously fix brown fringe. \u201cI mean, um, yes. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I get your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy what?\u201d There was surprise in the boy\u2019s voice, as if that was genuinely the last thing he\u2019d expected to hear.</p><p>\u201cYour name?\u201d Phil said, raising an eyebrow. \u201cFor the order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! Right, yeah, the order.\u201d Phil nearly laughed when the stranger\u2019s voice broke and he paused to clear his throat. \u201cMy name is Dan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright, then, Dan.\u201d Phil smiled again, quickly ringing Dan up and giving him the change. \u201cIt\u2019ll be ready in a few minutes. You can wait anywhere you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>Dan nodded. He walked away with red cheeks, seeming to try to hide in the hood of his grey, horned jacket. Phil couldn\u2019t help giggle.</p><p>\u201cLooks like someone thinks you\u2019re cute.\u201d</p><p>Phil jumped at the voice so close to his ear, only relaxing when he turned around to see his friend PJ. \u201cChrist Peej, you scared me.\u201d He huffed softly and glared at PJ as he went about putting his apron on. \u201cHe did not. I think he was just nervous.\u201d</p><p>PJ gave Phil a look that Phil didn\u2019t quite understand. \u201cPhil, you\u2019re literally the blindest person I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d PJ quit speaking as Dan came backup to the counter, hastily grabbing his drink before practically bolting out the door. \u201cSee? That is <i>not </i>just nervous. That\u2019s\u2026 dare I say lust?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually shut up.\u201d Phil rolled his eyes again. \u201cI have work to do. Go away.\u201d</p><p>PJ looked around the store, which only had one person in it, and gave Phil another look. \u201cWhatever you say, mate.\u201d </p>\n<br><p>A few weeks later, Phil was working bar when he saw a familiar grey hoodie with little horns on it, and a few minutes later, Phil was holding a sticker for a grande caramel macchiato with the name \u2018Dan\u2019 on it.</p><p>So, like anybody would, Phil slapped the sticker onto a venti cup.</p><p>\u201cCaramel macchiato for Dan.\u201d</p><p>Moments later, Dan popped into view in front of the counter and Phil held the out the drink.</p><p>Dan\u2019s face twisted in confusion, glancing between Phil and the cup for a moment. \u201cI ordered-\u201d</p><p>Phil shushed him quietly, pushing the cup into his hand and winking. \u201cI won\u2019t tell if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Before Phil turned around, he saw Dan\u2019s cheeks turn the same pretty shade of red they did the first time they met, and he spent the rest of his shift with a grin that he refused to explain to his coworkers. <br><br><br></p><p>The next time Dan came into the store while Phil was working, Phil was at the register again. \u201cDan!\u201d He said happily after the man in front of Dan moved away. \u201cAnother caramel macchiato or are you feeling like you wanna shake it up?\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s lips curled up into a soft smile. \u201cI dunno. If I were to shake it up, what would you suggest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m personally actually partial to caramel macchiatos, but white mochas are pretty good too, if you\u2019ve got a sweet tooth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d Dan asked, a twinkle in his eye that Phil was afraid to question.</p><p>\u201cHave a sweet tooth? Definitely. I\u2019m one of those weirdos who can eat a whole bag of marshmallows on its own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuly noted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019ll it be, then?\u201d Phil asked, because there was a line behind Dan and he couldn\u2019t keep talking even though part of him really wanted to.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stick with my caramel macchiato for now.\u201d <br><br><br></p><p>It was dead again, and Phil wa working bar. He\u2019d cleaned twice in the past two hours between the few drinks he\u2019d had to make, just because he had nothing else to do, and he was on the verge of doing it again when the door opened and Dan walked in. He ordered another grande caramel macchiato, Phil made it in a venti cup again, and when Phil handed it to Dan, he gave a secretive wink.</p><p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t have to do that, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s cheeks tinted a nice shade of pink and Phil\u2019s heart felt warm. Dan had been coming into the store a lot more recently. Phil joked about it being because he knew that Phil would give him a venti instead of a grande, but the way Dan smiled when he said the joke made Phil almost certain that that wasn\u2019t true. If Dan was coming for the coffee, he\u2019d be smiling at his cup like that, not at Phil. At least, that\u2019s what PJ had told him.</p><p>\u201cWhat time do you get off?\u201d</p><p>The question fell off of Dan\u2019s tongue so quickly that Phil had trouble understanding it at first. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in, like, a weird way, I just\u2026\u201d Dan bit his lip, glancing around nervously. There were only a few people in the store, and Dan seemed determined to make sure that none of them were staring before he continued. \u201cFigured I should buy you a coffee. You know, to repay you for all the free upgrades you\u2019ve given me.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cI actually get free coffee at the end of my shifts. It\u2019s a perk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I might have to start working here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not even the best part. We get Spotify premium for free, too.\u201d Phil grinned, tongue poking out between his teeth as he glanced at the clock. \u201cI get off in thirty minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring you another macchiato, addict.\u201d <br><br><br></p><p>A little over thirty minutes later, Phil was walking toward Dan\u2019s table with two macchiatos in his hands. \u201cHere.\u201d He set one down by Dan and then sat in the seat across from him.</p><p>It was weird, being with Dan like this. It felt somehow more intimate now that there wasn\u2019t a bar between them - now that it wasn\u2019t part of Phil\u2019s job, but part of his free time. Part of his life instead of just his work.</p><p>\u201cOh, you were serious.\u201d Dan let out a nervous laugh and wrapped his hands around the cup as if it was some sort of security blanket. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>It was quiet for a few moments, verging on awkward.</p><p>\u201cI have a confession.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Phil\u2019s hands were clammy suddenly, his heart racing. What sort of confession could Dan have to tell someone he saw a couple times a week at most, someone he\u2019d only talked to for a maximum of twenty minutes at a time?</p><p>\u201cI watch your YouTube videos.\u201d Dan\u2019s face was rapidly turning red.</p><p>\u2018Oh, God, I thought you were about to tell me you murdered someone or something.\u201d Phil\u2019s entire body relaxed and he let out a shaky breath. \u201cJesus. That\u2019s so much better than what I was thinking. You could\u2019ve opened with that. I feel like that\u2019s not a good enough reason to use the word \u2018confession\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes it is!\u2019 Dan squeaked, huffing. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow? You just found my videos, right? That\u2019s not weird. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re a stalker or something.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s face just got redder.</p><p>\u201cOh my god. Are you a stalker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I mean, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Dan huffed again and hid his face in his hands, sinking back into his chair. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching your videos for, like, four years. I knew you lived in Manchester, I just- I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d run into you. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d work at the first bloody Starbucks I went to after coming here for uni.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been watching me for that long?\u201d Phil\u2019s voice was full of shock, and that was the only thing he could focus in on, honestly. Four years? That was almost as long as he\u2019d been making videos, probably longer than he\u2019d really considered YouTube a career.</p><p>\u201cWell- yeah. I just felt like I had to tell you. I was - I mean, I <i>am </i>- such a big fan of you. It felt weird talking to you without you knowing that. Like I was lying to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 sweet.\u201d Phil smiled softly, moving his foot forward to bump Dan\u2019s leg. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anybody liked me that much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. You\u2019re just so creative and cool and it\u2019s like-\u201d Dan seemed to have to force himself to shut up, head shaking a little. \u201cSorry. Yeah. I do, though, really. You\u2019re the person who inspired me to start my channel, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. You replied to me on twitter two years ago. I replied to something you tweeted basically saying that I wished I could be a YouTuber like you and you told me to just do it, so\u2026 I did. I\u2019m glad I did, too. I love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, you have a channel too? What is it?\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s nose scrunched up a little. \u201cUm.. it\u2019s danisnotonfire. Cringey, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s cool.\u201d Phil smiled brightly, leaning into the table with excited eyes. \u201cWe should totally do some collab videos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Dan\u2019s entire body perked up. \u201cYou\u2019d do that with me?\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cOf course! I\u2019ve given you enough free coffee that I thought that was clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat- what would we even do?\u201d</p><p>Phil thought for a moment. \u201cWe could just do some simple q-and-a videos. Ask our followers to send stuff in and do one for each of our channels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI liked that.\u201d Dan smiled softly. \u201cWe have to have matching names of some sort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, definitely. What\u2019s yours gonna be?\u201d</p><p>Dan grinned. \u201cAmazing Dan.\u201d</p><p>Phil laughed. \u201cWow. Are you stealing my branding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could be that cool.\u201d Dan rolled his eyes, speaking again before Phil had the chance to interrupt. \u201cWhat\u2019s yours?\u2019</p><p>Phil thought for a moment, The answer was so obvious, but when it came to him, his face must have lit up because suddenly Dan was leaning forward like the answer was the most important thing in the world.</p><p>\u201cPhil is not on fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re stealing my brand now, too?\u201d Dan laughed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only fair.\u201c</p><p>\u201cI guess so. I can\u2019t complain, though. I get the sexy emo branding. You\u2019re stuck with edgy jokes and llamas. Also placentas and sometimes Delia Smith.\u201d</p><p>Phil laughed. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ve got to watch your videos.\u201d His tongue found its way between his teeth again, and he didn\u2019t miss the way Dan\u2019s eyes tracked it. \u201cI\u2019m not mad about it, either. I don\u2019t think a cute twink is the worst branding I could have.\u201d</p><p>Dan choked on his coffee. \u201cRight. Okay.\u201d His cheeks were red and his voice was high. \u201cI should, um\u2026 I should get going. I have school and stuff.\u201d</p><p>Phil smirked as Dan shuffled out of his seat.</p><p>\u201cAlright, I guess. I\u2019ll see you later, Danisnotonfire.\u201d</p><p>Dan rolled his eyes, but his smile was fond. \u201cShut up. Bye, Phil.\u201d</p><p>Once Dan was out of sight, Phil pulled his phone out and opened up twitter, searching for the user <i>danisnotonfire </i>. He followed it immediately, then opened up a DM.</p><p><i><b>amazingphil: </b>awrf</i></p><p><i><b>amazingphil: </b>hi dan ^-^</i></p><p><i><b>amazingphil: </b>i knew you looked familiar. i\u2019ve seen this icon like a bajillion times xD</i></p><p>He locked his phone and stood up to gather his things. He was barely out the door when his phone pinged a few times. It was \u00a0twitter notifications.</p><p><i><b>danisnotonfire: </b>time to jump off a building</i></p><p><i><b>danisnotonfire: </b>i knew i should\u2019ve kept my fanboying to myself</i></p><p><i><b>danisnotonfire: </b>in my defense i thought you\u2019d only notice me if i tweeted you every five minutes</i></p><p><i><b>danisnotonfire: </b>how was i supposed to know you would notice me at fucking starbucks of all places xD</i></p><p><i>Phil laughed, waiting a momen</i>t to decide what to reply.</p><p><i><b>amazingphil: </b>honestly i\u2019m surprised it took me this long</i></p><p><i><b>amazingphil: </b>maybe i was destined to meet you and that\u2019s why the universe shoved you into my starbucks :3</i></p><p><i><b>amazingphil: </b>but honestly it was just a matter of time. I\u2019d notice someone as pretty as you anywhere.</i></p><p>Phil shoved his phone in his pocket, pretending the redness in his cheeks was from the cold as he started walking away from his Starbucks - well, it was <i>their </i>Starbucks now, really, wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>It was true, though. Something about Dan made Phil sure they were destined to meet, they were destined to make videos together, destined to be friends and maybe something more.</p><p>It had been a while since Phil felt this way. He loved making videos, but he hadn\u2019t felt hopeful about it in so long, but the idea of making videos with Dan had Phil itching to get in front of a camera right now with the pretty brown-haired boy who\u2019d accidentally found Phil right by his side. It was exhilarating in ways Phil couldn\u2019t really understand.</p><p>They\u2019d create something <i>amazing </i>together. Phil just knew it.</p>",

Go away.&rdquo;</p><p>PJ looked around the store, which only had one person in it, and gave Phil another look. &ldquo;Whatever you say, mate.&rdquo; </p>\n<br /><p>A few weeks later, Phil was working bar when he saw a familiar grey hoodie with little horns on it, and a few minutes later, Phil was holding a sticker for a grande caramel macchiato with the name &lsquo;Dan&rsquo; on it.</p><p>So, like anybody would, Phil slapped the sticker onto a venti cup.</p><p>&ldquo;Caramel macchiato for Dan.&rdquo;</p><p>Moments later, Dan popped into view in front of the counter and Phil held the out the drink.</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s face twisted in confusion, glancing between Phil and the cup for a moment. &ldquo;I ordered-&rdquo;</p><p>Phil shushed him quietly, pushing the cup into his hand and winking. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t tell if you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>Before Phil turned around, he saw Dan&rsquo;s cheeks turn the same pretty shade of red they did the first time they met, and he spent the rest of his shift with a grin that he refused to explain to his coworkers. <br /><br /><br /></p><p>The next time Dan came into the store while Phil was working, Phil was at the register again. &ldquo;Dan!&rdquo; He said happily after the man in front of Dan moved away. &ldquo;Another caramel macchiato or are you feeling like you wanna shake it up?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s lips curled up into a soft smile. &ldquo;I dunno. If I were to shake it up, what would you suggest?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m personally actually partial to caramel macchiatos, but white mochas are pretty good too, if you&rsquo;ve got a sweet tooth.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; Dan asked, a twinkle in his eye that Phil was afraid to question.</p><p>&ldquo;Have a sweet tooth? Definitely. I&rsquo;m one of those weirdos who can eat a whole bag of marshmallows on its own.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Duly noted.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll it be, then?&rdquo; Phil asked, because there was a line behind Dan and he couldn&rsquo;t keep talking even though part of him really wanted to.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stick with my caramel macchiato for now.&rdquo; <br /><br /><br /></p><p>It was dead again, and Phil wa working bar. He&rsquo;d cleaned twice in the past two hours between the few drinks he&rsquo;d had to make, just because he had nothing else to do, and he was on the verge of doing it again when the door opened and Dan walked in. He ordered another grande caramel macchiato, Phil made it in a venti cup again, and when Phil handed it to Dan, he gave a secretive wink.</p><p>&ldquo;You really don&rsquo;t have to do that, you know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s cheeks tinted a nice shade of pink and Phil&rsquo;s heart felt warm. Dan had been coming into the store a lot more recently. Phil joked about it being because he knew that Phil would give him a venti instead of a grande, but the way Dan smiled when he said the joke made Phil almost certain that that wasn&rsquo;t true. If Dan was coming for the coffee, he&rsquo;d be smiling at his cup like that, not at Phil. At least, that&rsquo;s what PJ had told him.</p><p>&ldquo;What time do you get off?&rdquo;</p><p>The question fell off of Dan&rsquo;s tongue so quickly that Phil had trouble understanding it at first. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not in, like, a weird way, I just&hellip;&rdquo; Dan bit his lip, glancing around nervously. There were only a few people in the store, and Dan seemed determined to make sure that none of them were staring before he continued. &ldquo;Figured I should buy you a coffee. You know, to repay you for all the free upgrades you&rsquo;ve given me.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s lips twitched. &ldquo;I actually get free coffee at the end of my shifts. It&rsquo;s a perk.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really? I might have to start working here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not even the best part. We get Spotify premium for free, too.&rdquo; Phil grinned, tongue poking out between his teeth as he glanced at the clock. &ldquo;I get off in thirty minutes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is that a yes?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring you another macchiato, addict.&rdquo; <br /><br /><br /></p><p>A little over thirty minutes later, Phil was walking toward Dan&rsquo;s table with two macchiatos in his hands. &ldquo;Here.&rdquo; He set one down by Dan and then sat in the seat across from him.</p><p>It was weird, being with Dan like this. It felt somehow more intimate now that there wasn&rsquo;t a bar between them - now that it wasn&rsquo;t part of Phil&rsquo;s job, but part of his free time. Part of his life instead of just his work.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you were serious.&rdquo; Dan let out a nervous laugh and wrapped his hands around the cup as if it was some sort of security blanket. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p><p>It was quiet for a few moments, verging on awkward.</p><p>&ldquo;I have a confession.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Phil&rsquo;s hands were clammy suddenly, his heart racing. What sort of confession could Dan have to tell someone he saw a couple times a week at most, someone he&rsquo;d only talked to for a maximum of twenty minutes at a time?</p><p>&ldquo;I watch your YouTube videos.&rdquo; Dan&rsquo;s face was rapidly turning red.</p><p>&lsquo;Oh, God, I thought you were about to tell me you murdered someone or something.&rdquo; Phil&rsquo;s entire body relaxed and he let out a shaky breath. &ldquo;Jesus. That&rsquo;s so much better than what I was thinking. You could&rsquo;ve opened with that. I feel like that&rsquo;s not a good enough reason to use the word &lsquo;confession&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes it is!&rsquo; Dan squeaked, huffing. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s embarrassing!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How? You just found my videos, right? That&rsquo;s not weird. It&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re a stalker or something.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s face just got redder.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god. Are you a stalker?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No! I mean, I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo; Dan huffed again and hid his face in his hands, sinking back into his chair. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been watching your videos for, like, four years. I knew you lived in Manchester, I just- I didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d run into you. I didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d work at the first bloody Starbucks I went to after coming here for uni.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been watching me for that long?&rdquo; Phil&rsquo;s voice was full of shock, and that was the only thing he could focus in on, honestly. Four years? That was almost as long as he&rsquo;d been making videos, probably longer than he&rsquo;d really considered YouTube a career.</p><p>&ldquo;Well- yeah. I just felt like I had to tell you. I was - I mean, I <i>am </i>- such a big fan of you. It felt weird talking to you without you knowing that. Like I was lying to you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip; sweet.&rdquo; Phil smiled softly, moving his foot forward to bump Dan&rsquo;s leg. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know anybody liked me that much.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course I do. You&rsquo;re just so creative and cool and it&rsquo;s like-&rdquo; Dan seemed to have to force himself to shut up, head shaking a little. &ldquo;Sorry. Yeah. I do, though, really. You&rsquo;re the person who inspired me to start my channel, actually.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. You replied to me on twitter two years ago. I replied to something you tweeted basically saying that I wished I could be a YouTuber like you and you told me to just do it, so&hellip; I did. I&rsquo;m glad I did, too. I love it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, you have a channel too? What is it?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s nose scrunched up a little. &ldquo;Um.. it&rsquo;s danisnotonfire. Cringey, I know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s cool.&rdquo; Phil smiled brightly, leaning into the table with excited eyes. &ldquo;We should totally do some collab videos.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Dan&rsquo;s entire body perked up. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d do that with me?&rdquo; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Of course! I&rsquo;ve given you enough free coffee that I thought that was clear.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What- what would we even do?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil thought for a moment. &ldquo;We could just do some simple q-and-a videos. Ask our followers to send stuff in and do one for each of our channels.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I liked that.&rdquo; Dan smiled softly. &ldquo;We have to have matching names of some sort.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, definitely. What&rsquo;s yours gonna be?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan grinned. &ldquo;Amazing Dan.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil laughed. &ldquo;Wow. Are you stealing my branding?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wish I could be that cool.&rdquo; Dan rolled his eyes, speaking again before Phil had the chance to interrupt. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s yours?&rsquo;</p><p>Phil thought for a moment, The answer was so obvious, but when it came to him, his face must have lit up because suddenly Dan was leaning forward like the answer was the most important thing in the world.</p><p>&ldquo;Phil is not on fire.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re stealing my brand now, too?&rdquo; Dan laughed.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only fair.&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I guess so. I can&rsquo;t complain, though. I get the sexy emo branding. You&rsquo;re stuck with edgy jokes and llamas. Also placentas and sometimes Delia Smith.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil laughed. &ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;ve got to watch your videos.&rdquo; His tongue found its way between his teeth again, and he didn&rsquo;t miss the way Dan&rsquo;s eyes tracked it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not mad about it, either. I don&rsquo;t think a cute twink is the worst branding I could have.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan choked on his coffee. &ldquo;Right. Okay.&rdquo; His cheeks were red and his voice was high. &ldquo;I should, um&hellip; I should get going. I have school and stuff.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil smirked as Dan shuffled out of his seat.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, I guess. I&rsquo;ll see you later, Danisnotonfire.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan rolled his eyes, but his smile was fond. &ldquo;Shut up. Bye, Phil.&rdquo;</p><p>Once Dan was out of sight, Phil pulled his phone out and opened up twitter, searching for the user <i>danisnotonfire </i>. He followed it immediately, then opened up a DM.</p><p><i><b>amazingphil: </b>awrf</i></p><p><i><b>amazingphil: </b>hi dan ^-^</i></p><p><i><b>amazingphil: </b>i knew you looked familiar. i&rsquo;ve seen this icon like a bajillion times xD</i></p><p>He locked his phone and stood up to gather his things. He was barely out the door when his phone pinged a few times. It was &nbsp;twitter notifications.</p><p><i><b>danisnotonfire: </b>time to jump off a building</i></p><p><i><b>danisnotonfire: </b>i knew i should&rsquo;ve kept my fanboying to myself</i></p><p><i><b>danisnotonfire: </b>in my defense i thought you&rsquo;d only notice me if i tweeted you every five minutes</i></p><p><i><b>danisnotonfire: </b>how was i supposed to know you would notice me at fucking starbucks of all places xD</i></p><p><i>Phil laughed, waiting a momen</i>t to decide what to reply.</p><p><i><b>amazingphil: </b>honestly i&rsquo;m surprised it took me this long</i></p><p><i><b>amazingphil: </b>maybe i was destined to meet you and that&rsquo;s why the universe shoved you into my starbucks :3</i></p><p><i><b>amazingphil: </b>but honestly it was just a matter of time. I&rsquo;d notice someone as pretty as you anywhere.</i></p><p>Phil shoved his phone in his pocket, pretending the redness in his cheeks was from the cold as he started walking away from his Starbucks - well, it was <i>their </i>Starbucks now, really, wasn&rsquo;t it?</p><p>It was true, though. Something about Dan made Phil sure they were destined to meet, they were destined to make videos together, destined to be friends and maybe something more.</p><p>It had been a while since Phil felt this way. He loved making videos, but he hadn&rsquo;t felt hopeful about it in so long, but the idea of making videos with Dan had Phil itching to get in front of a camera right now with the pretty brown-haired boy who&rsquo;d accidentally found Phil right by his side. It was exhilarating in ways Phil couldn&rsquo;t really understand.</p><p>They&rsquo;d create something <i>amazing </i>together. Phil just knew it.</p></p>",
