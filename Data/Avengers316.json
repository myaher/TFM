And boy, if there&rsquo;s one thing I wanna be is popular.</p><p>I like laughing. Jokes are fun. Jokes are real fun. My name is Alistair Cartwright, I&rsquo;m an aspiring webcomic writer. I don&rsquo;t got friends or nothing, partly &lsquo;cause I live in a vault. Like a large, giant vault that seemingly goes on forever. </p><p>I remember at one point that I didn&rsquo;t live in a vault, but then I was just standing around, minding my own business, being pretty darn lazy. I wasted my entire toddler years, just sitting around. I didn&rsquo;t even go to the bathroom, that&rsquo;s how lazy I was. The Master has told me these things, and says pretty soon I&rsquo;ll be able to clear all my minds of evil alien thoughts. But for now, I live in this giant vault that seems to be never ending, and full of constant twists and turns.</p><p>At one point I thought I had gotten free, but I had not. In fact, such the opposite. In fact, that entire part was just an elaborate section of the vault. I seen the Marvel movies. At least, I&rsquo;m pretty sure I did. I&rsquo;m gonna describe my favorite ones, like in a Top Five category sorta thing. There&rsquo;s gonna be a lot of them, five particularly. I shouldn&rsquo;t have been like &ldquo;There should be a lot of them.&rdquo; Boy, the Master would be mad. And you don&rsquo;t wanna make the Master mad. I had a brother at one point. </p><p>Okay. So first Marvel movie that I think is real fun, is that movie where the guy who looks a lot like a Master, Chris Hemsworth as the Master explained to me several times. I&rsquo;ve never met the Master. I just receive notes from him, often taped to my body when I&rsquo;m sleeping. I just wake up and I look down, and there&rsquo;s a new note. And one of the times, the note said &ldquo;I look a lot like Chris Hemsworth, aka Thor.&rdquo; And I&rsquo;m like, that&rsquo;s neat. That&rsquo;s real cool. I like Thor. Thor&rsquo;s a real fun character.</p><p>Master says in many other ways, he&rsquo;s a lot like Thor. The fact that he&rsquo;s God, and that he can eat numerous cans like a goat, who the Master claims was the first animal he created. He says oftentimes, he gets really angry that he tried to go for humans, because the goats were so perfect. He likes goats.</p><p>The mayor of the vault is a goat. And so is the vice mayor. It took many years for a non-goat to become anything in the political system here. I like the Thor movies. The next movies I like, you could say these are the number two movies I enjoy, are different ones. </p><p>You know how the Master, who claims he can control the weather and stuff, and I believe it, because here in the vault anytime it rains or gets lightnings, you can know the Master&rsquo;s angry. I receive the notes that I got when I woke up after a big scary rain/lightning storm were from the Master, and he said he was angry at me. I had expressed interest in leaving the vault at one point, and he said no. And then wildebeests killed my brother. Anyways.</p><p>I like the Avengers movie, with that Scarlet Witch lady. I know she can&rsquo;t control the weather, but in theory she could, and I like to imagine that she creates a whole flood that will come and wash away this whole thing, freeing us and bringing my brother back to life. He liked tomatoes. </p><p>Number three. You know what guy I like? I like that Tony Stark. Tony Stark&rsquo;s a pretty cool dude, 'cause Tony Stark is like, you ever seen the way a goat will just come up and grow legs and strangle you for a few minutes, and you&rsquo;re pretty sure you&rsquo;re gonna die, and in that moment you get real cocky about things, like &ldquo;Finally, I get to be free from this horrible nightmare that I have been punished for, all because my father accidentally once pushed over the Master when they were in grade school.&rdquo; And then no, I have to live unfortunately.</p><p>Well, Tony Stark exudes that stuff all the time, and I think that&rsquo;s cool that a person can do that without being nearly strangled to death by a goat.</p><p>Okay. Let&rsquo;s see. Number four. Okay. The Master has repeated several times that despite what the movies say, I guess one of the questions you all may be asking yourself is how do we get the movies? I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t know, I just wake up knowing them. I think the Master likes them. And we tend to see whatever the Master likes. Anyways.</p><p>I like Guardians of the Galaxy, I think the raccoon is super cute and funny, and that&rsquo;s my pick. And number five is Captain Corelli&rsquo;s Mandolin. I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s a Marvel movie, but I&rsquo;ve only ever seen four to five movies in my life, and the fifth one was Captain Corelli&rsquo;s Mandolin. The Master likes that movie. I don&rsquo;t know why. I don&rsquo;t even know what a mandolin is. </p><p>Now if you excuse me, I&rsquo;m gonna lie in a small little ball for the next several days in celebration of my birthday. Bye.</p>",

And boy, if there\u2019s one thing I wanna be is popular.</p><p>I like laughing. Jokes are fun. Jokes are real fun. My name is Alistair Cartwright, I\u2019m an aspiring webcomic writer. I don\u2019t got friends or nothing, partly \u2018cause I live in a vault. Like a large, giant vault that seemingly goes on forever. </p><p>I remember at one point that I didn\u2019t live in a vault, but then I was just standing around, minding my own business, being pretty darn lazy. I wasted my entire toddler years, just sitting around. I didn\u2019t even go to the bathroom, that\u2019s how lazy I was. The Master has told me these things, and says pretty soon I\u2019ll be able to clear all my minds of evil alien thoughts. But for now, I live in this giant vault that seems to be never ending, and full of constant twists and turns.</p><p>At one point I thought I had gotten free, but I had not. In fact, such the opposite. In fact, that entire part was just an elaborate section of the vault. I seen the Marvel movies. At least, I\u2019m pretty sure I did. I\u2019m gonna describe my favorite ones, like in a Top Five category sorta thing. There\u2019s gonna be a lot of them, five particularly. I shouldn\u2019t have been like \u201cThere should be a lot of them.\u201d Boy, the Master would be mad. And you don\u2019t wanna make the Master mad. I had a brother at one point. </p><p>Okay. So first Marvel movie that I think is real fun, is that movie where the guy who looks a lot like a Master, Chris Hemsworth as the Master explained to me several times. I\u2019ve never met the Master. I just receive notes from him, often taped to my body when I\u2019m sleeping. I just wake up and I look down, and there\u2019s a new note. And one of the times, the note said \u201cI look a lot like Chris Hemsworth, aka Thor.\u201d And I\u2019m like, that\u2019s neat. That\u2019s real cool. I like Thor. Thor\u2019s a real fun character.</p><p>Master says in many other ways, he\u2019s a lot like Thor. The fact that he\u2019s God, and that he can eat numerous cans like a goat, who the Master claims was the first animal he created. He says oftentimes, he gets really angry that he tried to go for humans, because the goats were so perfect. He likes goats.</p><p>The mayor of the vault is a goat. And so is the vice mayor. It took many years for a non-goat to become anything in the political system here. I like the Thor movies. The next movies I like, you could say these are the number two movies I enjoy, are different ones. </p><p>You know how the Master, who claims he can control the weather and stuff, and I believe it, because here in the vault anytime it rains or gets lightnings, you can know the Master\u2019s angry. I receive the notes that I got when I woke up after a big scary rain/lightning storm were from the Master, and he said he was angry at me. I had expressed interest in leaving the vault at one point, and he said no. And then wildebeests killed my brother. Anyways.</p><p>I like the Avengers movie, with that Scarlet Witch lady. I know she can\u2019t control the weather, but in theory she could, and I like to imagine that she creates a whole flood that will come and wash away this whole thing, freeing us and bringing my brother back to life. He liked tomatoes. </p><p>Number three. You know what guy I like? I like that Tony Stark. Tony Stark\u2019s a pretty cool dude, 'cause Tony Stark is like, you ever seen the way a goat will just come up and grow legs and strangle you for a few minutes, and you\u2019re pretty sure you\u2019re gonna die, and in that moment you get real cocky about things, like \u201cFinally, I get to be free from this horrible nightmare that I have been punished for, all because my father accidentally once pushed over the Master when they were in grade school.\u201d And then no, I have to live unfortunately.</p><p>Well, Tony Stark exudes that stuff all the time, and I think that\u2019s cool that a person can do that without being nearly strangled to death by a goat.</p><p>Okay. Let\u2019s see. Number four. Okay. The Master has repeated several times that despite what the movies say, I guess one of the questions you all may be asking yourself is how do we get the movies? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know, I just wake up knowing them. I think the Master likes them. And we tend to see whatever the Master likes. Anyways.</p><p>I like Guardians of the Galaxy, I think the raccoon is super cute and funny, and that\u2019s my pick. And number five is Captain Corelli\u2019s Mandolin. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a Marvel movie, but I\u2019ve only ever seen four to five movies in my life, and the fifth one was Captain Corelli\u2019s Mandolin. The Master likes that movie. I don\u2019t know why. I don\u2019t even know what a mandolin is. </p><p>Now if you excuse me, I\u2019m gonna lie in a small little ball for the next several days in celebration of my birthday. Bye.</p>",

It was ridiculously hot. The California heat seemed to be extraordinary oppressive this morning and all Bucky could think of was ways to make his metal arm not accidentally brush against his skin. He had made that mistake four times this morning.\u00a0\n\nTony had decided it was essential for the Avengers to take a getaway trip for the sake of sanity. Bucky called bullshit,\u00a0\n\nclearly aware that Tony was postponing yet another Avengers meeting with Ross and Fury. Not that he minded.The team had spent the last month communicating with officials nearly everyday to organize plans, substantiate future missions, and debrief every and any inquiries from Maria Hill. The vacation was well deserved. But the climate made it feel more like a spa day gone wrong than a relaxing day at the beach.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Nat? I thought she and Y/N were going to get the drinks.\u201d Sam grumbled, rubbing more sunscreen on.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cShe said that 20 minutes ago. I bet they\u2019re lounging in the bar. I know Tony\u2019s making drinks over there.\u201d Steve added, sinking deeper into his sun chair. Bucky turned around and squinted. Surely enough the two women sat perched on two bar-stools, entertaining Tony. The drinks were long forgotten.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re not wrong.\u201d Bucky muttered. Steve turned around before groaning.<br/></p><p>\u201cHey what\u2019s the deal with you and Y/N anyway?\u201d Sam asked, turning towards Bucky. Steve raised an eyebrow at his friend.<br/></p><p>\u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d Bucky stated, looking away. Steve looked at Sam in confusion.<br/></p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something going on with Y/N and Bucky?\u201d<br/></p><p>Bucky pursed his lips. There wasn\u2019t anything going on&hellip;<i>necessarily</i>. Bucky had developed a \u201csmall attraction\u201d towards his team mate and there was nothing wrong with that. Until Sam found out. Bucky still regretted that day, thinking of a million different ways it could have gone with an outcome that was completely different. Sadly, no matter how much he dreamed, reality sucked and Sam would never not be a dick.</p><p><i>Y/N had just finished training with Natasha and was eager to ravage the fridge for anything that would satisfy her seemingly unquenchable appetite. Bucky sat on the sofa, his eyebrows knit in confusion.</i></p><p><i>\u201cDo you want me to turn on the television? I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be way more interesting to stare at than just a blank screen.\u201d Y/N said, smiling lightly. Bucky blinked, now noticing the blank television.<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cI was just thinking.\u201d He replied, blushing lightly. He had been pondering about her and how exactly he would ask her out.<b> This was much easier back in the 40s.</b><br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cAhh. Do you want anything from the fridge?\u201d Y/N asked, turning towards the kitchen. Bucky couldn\u2019t restrain his eyes from checking out the rest of her figure. He was so utterly drawn to her that he was sure she could make anything look beautiful. She turned around at his lack of response. Bucky flushed.</i></p><p><i>\u201cJust a bottle of water.\u201d\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>Y/N hummed in response and Bucky began to panic. <b>It\u2019s now or never Barnes. </b>He got up quickly, his mind set on asking her out. He didn\u2019t realize a familiar well built man with a smirk waltz into the room.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cY/N, I was wondering if you would wanna-\u201d<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cHey manchurian candidate, whatcha got there?\u201d\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>Bucky froze.<b> That son of a bitch.</b> He looked at Sam, his eyes narrowing at him. Sam looked at Y/N before looking back at Bucky, the wheels in his mind turning. <b>He knows.</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cA water bottle.\u201d Bucky said between his teeth.<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cY/N, could you toss me a granola bar?\u201d Sam asked, his shit eating grin only widening. Bucky only had one wish at that moment: make Sam Wilson disappear.<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cSure. Bucky, what were you saying?\u201d Y/N asked, tossing Sam a bar.\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cI was thinking we could-\u201d<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cOh my god, was he going to tell you how I walked in on him watching porn? Dear god-\u201d Sam barked out in laughter. Bucky stared wide eyed, absolutely mortified.<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat?\u201d Y/N asked, clearly bewildered.<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cI walked in on Bucky watching porn. It was hilarious and traumatizing.\u201d Sam snickered. Bucky tried to speak, but his voice betrayed him and all he could do was watch the horrifying scene unravel before him. He looked at Y/N, his eyes almost pleading her not to believe Sam. She let out a small chuckle, clearly uncomfortable. Bucky had never wanted to kill Sam more than he did in that moment.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThat\u2019s great um. I\u2019ll sit this story out, see ya guys later.\u201d</i><br/></p><p>Bucky shook his head at the memory, the embarrassment still causing him to blush.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo, Sam just likes to make up things.\u201d Bucky mumbled.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI do not! Old man\u2019s just saying that because he\u2019s sad he hasn\u2019t gotten a kiss since 19-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAre you asking for a black eye, because I am not afraid-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cGuys settle down. Has it really been that long since you\u2019ve kissed someone Buck?\u201d Steve asked, clearly amused. Bucky looked away, his lips pressing into a fine line.<br/></p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cLiar!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s lying about what?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Natasha and Y/N suddenly came into view, a cooler in both of their hands. Steve let out a sigh of relief, violently taking the box from Natasha\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cEasy there. You\u2019re acting as if we were gone for an eternity.\u201d She said, taking a seat at the edge of Steve\u2019s sun chair.<br/></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you guys <i>were </i>gone for an eternity.\u201d Bucky grumbled, cracking open a Milwaukee beer. Y/N took a seat beside him.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou guys are a bunch of divas. And who\u2019s a liar?\u201d She asked, crossing her legs.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cFrozen Popsicle No.2 over there hasn\u2019t gotten a good ol\u2019 smooch since the 20th century.\u201d Sam crooned, making kissing faces at Bucky. Using his metal arm, Bucky grabbed Sam\u2019s bicep causing him to shriek. Steve immediately set the fire out.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI highly doubt that.\u201d Y/N said, popping a pistachio in her mouth. Bucky raised an eyebrow at her.<br/></p><p>\u201cLook at you. Who wouldn\u2019t want to make out with you?\u201d She stated before freezing. The four of them stared at her, their gazes unwavering. Y/N shrugged sheepishly.</p><p>\u201cJust putting it out there.\u201d She whispered, taking a giant sip of her beer. Bucky stared at her for another moment before clearing his throat.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cAlright you two&hellip;save the sex eyes for later. I actually want to enjoy the vacation while it lasts.\u201d Sam quipped, causing them to laugh.\u00a0</p><p>Bucky couldn\u2019t seem to get her out of his mind the rest of the day. He distanced himself from Y/N as much as he could, convincing himself her words were out of pity. He wasn\u2019t aware that the distance hurt her or that she pined for him the same way.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a sun burn.\u201d<br/></p><p>Bucky shook slightly, looking to the side. Y/N stood there, her eyes peering at his chest. He was still shirtless, opting to not change because of the hot weather. He looked down at his chest, touching at the burnt skin before wincing.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHold on, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d She muttered, disappearing into the corridor. Bucky\u2019s heart began to pound. <i>Is she not weirded\u00a0out by me? After Sam\u2019s little stunt three days ago? And then earlier today? </i>Bucky took a seat on the kitchen chair. She came back with a first aid kit and got to her knees.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cThis is going to hurt a bit.\u201d Y/N said softly, squeezing out a white cream on to her hand.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cNothing I can\u2019t handle.\u201d He said, smiling slightly. She chuckled, slowly applying the cream to his chest. He didn\u2019t wince, simply staring at her as she worked Bucky swore Y/N was the most breathtaking woman he had ever seen. If he had wanted to kiss anyone, surely it would be her. Hell, when he thought of the word <i>intimacy</i>, he thought of her. Her and the lazy smile she would give him in the mornings when he made her coffee. Her and the chocolate chip pancakes she would make for him because Steve told her it reminded him of his ma. Her listening to everything Peter had to say about Star Wars when Tony was too busy in the lab. Her helping Wanda with her emotional trauma. Her looking out for the team when they stopped taking care of themselves. He swallowed thickly. It was so hard to not fall in love with her. She made it as easy as breathing.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staring.\u201d Y/N said, glancing at Bucky. He didn\u2019t reply, simply raising a finger to push her hair behind her ear.<br/></p><p>\u201cAnd you are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen.\u201d He mumbled, not caring if he confessed his feelings. Her breath stopped short and she gazed at him for a moment. His eyes were raw with emotion, a clear cerulean blue intensely gazing at her. Y/N looked down, carefully cleaning her hand with a wipe.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being coy.\u201d She whispered, trying not to let his close proximity affect her. She was failing. He grasped her hand slowly, urging her to look at him.<br/></p><p>\u201cI am being honest, doll.\u201d<br/></p><p>Y/N swallowed thickly, her eyes searching his face for some kind of sign. But it was clear. He was smitten and it showed. She couldn\u2019t hold herself back. Not now.</p><p>\u201cYou really haven\u2019t kissed a girl in that long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat embarrassing huh?\u201d He asked, chuckling. She placed her hands on his shoulders. She looked down, not wanting to face the possible impending rejection on his face.</p><p>\u201cCan I kiss you?\u201d She mumbled. He almost sighed in relief.<br/></p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d<br/></p><p>And then their lips were molding against each other. Bucky couldn\u2019t suppress the sigh he was holding in. Each opened mouth kiss conveyed the longing that they both felt. His veins were filled with adrenaline. The mere idea of tasting her lips was enough to drive him crazy but right now, he could barely restrain himself. \n\n He pulled her onto his lap, cupping her cheeks like it was the last thing he would ever hold dear to his heart.\n\nShe snagged at the ends of his hair, allowing to him groan against her mouth.

Steve let out a sigh of relief, violently taking the box from Natasha\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cEasy there. You\u2019re acting as if we were gone for an eternity.\u201d She said, taking a seat at the edge of Steve\u2019s sun chair.<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you guys <i>were </i>gone for an eternity.\u201d Bucky grumbled, cracking open a Milwaukee beer. Y/N took a seat beside him.<br></p><p>\u201cYou guys are a bunch of divas. And who\u2019s a liar?\u201d She asked, crossing her legs.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cFrozen Popsicle No.2 over there hasn\u2019t gotten a good ol\u2019 smooch since the 20th century.\u201d Sam crooned, making kissing faces at Bucky. Using his metal arm, Bucky grabbed Sam\u2019s bicep causing him to shriek. Steve immediately set the fire out.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI highly doubt that.\u201d Y/N said, popping a pistachio in her mouth. Bucky raised an eyebrow at her.<br></p><p>\u201cLook at you. Who wouldn\u2019t want to make out with you?\u201d She stated before freezing. The four of them stared at her, their gazes unwavering. Y/N shrugged sheepishly.</p><p>\u201cJust putting it out there.\u201d She whispered, taking a giant sip of her beer. Bucky stared at her for another moment before clearing his throat.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAlright you two\u2026save the sex eyes for later. I actually want to enjoy the vacation while it lasts.\u201d Sam quipped, causing them to laugh.\u00a0</p><p>Bucky couldn\u2019t seem to get her out of his mind the rest of the day. He distanced himself from Y/N as much as he could, convincing himself her words were out of pity. He wasn\u2019t aware that the distance hurt her or that she pined for him the same way.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a sun burn.\u201d<br></p><p>Bucky shook slightly, looking to the side. Y/N stood there, her eyes peering at his chest. He was still shirtless, opting to not change because of the hot weather. He looked down at his chest, touching at the burnt skin before wincing.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHold on, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d She muttered, disappearing into the corridor. Bucky\u2019s heart began to pound. <i>Is she not weirded\u00a0out by me? After Sam\u2019s little stunt three days ago? And then earlier today? </i>Bucky took a seat on the kitchen chair. She came back with a first aid kit and got to her knees.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThis is going to hurt a bit.\u201d Y/N said softly, squeezing out a white cream on to her hand.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNothing I can\u2019t handle.\u201d He said, smiling slightly. She chuckled, slowly applying the cream to his chest. He didn\u2019t wince, simply staring at her as she worked Bucky swore Y/N was the most breathtaking woman he had ever seen. If he had wanted to kiss anyone, surely it would be her. Hell, when he thought of the word <i>intimacy</i>, he thought of her. Her and the lazy smile she would give him in the mornings when he made her coffee. Her and the chocolate chip pancakes she would make for him because Steve told her it reminded him of his ma. Her listening to everything Peter had to say about Star Wars when Tony was too busy in the lab. Her helping Wanda with her emotional trauma. Her looking out for the team when they stopped taking care of themselves. He swallowed thickly. It was so hard to not fall in love with her. She made it as easy as breathing.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staring.\u201d Y/N said, glancing at Bucky. He didn\u2019t reply, simply raising a finger to push her hair behind her ear.<br></p><p>\u201cAnd you are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen.\u201d He mumbled, not caring if he confessed his feelings. Her breath stopped short and she gazed at him for a moment. His eyes were raw with emotion, a clear cerulean blue intensely gazing at her. Y/N looked down, carefully cleaning her hand with a wipe.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being coy.\u201d She whispered, trying not to let his close proximity affect her. She was failing. He grasped her hand slowly, urging her to look at him.<br></p><p>\u201cI am being honest, doll.\u201d<br></p><p>Y/N swallowed thickly, her eyes searching his face for some kind of sign. But it was clear. He was smitten and it showed. She couldn\u2019t hold herself back. Not now.</p><p>\u201cYou really haven\u2019t kissed a girl in that long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat embarrassing huh?\u201d He asked, chuckling. She placed her hands on his shoulders. She looked down, not wanting to face the possible impending rejection on his face.</p><p>\u201cCan I kiss you?\u201d She mumbled. He almost sighed in relief.<br></p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d<br></p><p>And then their lips were molding against each other. Bucky couldn\u2019t suppress the sigh he was holding in. Each opened mouth kiss conveyed the longing that they both felt. His veins were filled with adrenaline. The mere idea of tasting her lips was enough to drive him crazy but right now, he could barely restrain himself. \n\n He pulled her onto his lap, cupping her cheeks like it was the last thing he would ever hold dear to his heart.\n\nShe snagged at the ends of his hair, allowing to him groan against her mouth. The kiss was erotic and nothing like the soft and slow kiss Y/N dreamed it would be. Eventually the two of them stopped for air, leaning against each other.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou could have asked me a lot sooner, ya know?\u201d He panted, smiling dazedly at her. She rolled her eyes, leaning her head on his neck.<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get cocky now.\u201d She mumbled.<br></p><p>\u201cOh and for the record, I was not watching porn.\u201d Bucky stated, absentmindedly drawing shapes on her hip.<br></p><p>\u201cAnd what were you watching?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cProbably Dora the Explorer, or some shit.\u201d Sam piped up.

He wasn\u2019t aware that the distance hurt her or that she pined for him the same way.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a sun burn.\u201d<br></p><p>Bucky shook slightly, looking to the side. Y/N stood there, her eyes peering at his chest. He was still shirtless, opting to not change because of the hot weather. He looked down at his chest, touching at the burnt skin before wincing.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHold on, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d She muttered, disappearing into the corridor. Bucky\u2019s heart began to pound. <i>Is she not weirded\u00a0out by me? After Sam\u2019s little stunt three days ago? And then earlier today? </i>Bucky took a seat on the kitchen chair. She came back with a first aid kit and got to her knees.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThis is going to hurt a bit.\u201d Y/N said softly, squeezing out a white cream on to her hand.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNothing I can\u2019t handle.\u201d He said, smiling slightly. She chuckled, slowly applying the cream to his chest. He didn\u2019t wince, simply staring at her as she worked Bucky swore Y/N was the most breathtaking woman he had ever seen. If he had wanted to kiss anyone, surely it would be her. Hell, when he thought of the word <i>intimacy</i>, he thought of her. Her and the lazy smile she would give him in the mornings when he made her coffee. Her and the chocolate chip pancakes she would make for him because Steve told her it reminded him of his ma. Her listening to everything Peter had to say about Star Wars when Tony was too busy in the lab. Her helping Wanda with her emotional trauma. Her looking out for the team when they stopped taking care of themselves. He swallowed thickly. It was so hard to not fall in love with her. She made it as easy as breathing.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staring.\u201d Y/N said, glancing at Bucky. He didn\u2019t reply, simply raising a finger to push her hair behind her ear.<br></p><p>\u201cAnd you are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen.\u201d He mumbled, not caring if he confessed his feelings. Her breath stopped short and she gazed at him for a moment. His eyes were raw with emotion, a clear cerulean blue intensely gazing at her. Y/N looked down, carefully cleaning her hand with a wipe.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being coy.\u201d She whispered, trying not to let his close proximity affect her. She was failing. He grasped her hand slowly, urging her to look at him.<br></p><p>\u201cI am being honest, doll.\u201d<br></p><p>Y/N swallowed thickly, her eyes searching his face for some kind of sign. But it was clear. He was smitten and it showed. She couldn\u2019t hold herself back. Not now.</p><p>\u201cYou really haven\u2019t kissed a girl in that long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat embarrassing huh?\u201d He asked, chuckling. She placed her hands on his shoulders. She looked down, not wanting to face the possible impending rejection on his face.</p><p>\u201cCan I kiss you?\u201d She mumbled. He almost sighed in relief.<br></p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d<br></p><p>And then their lips were molding against each other. Bucky couldn\u2019t suppress the sigh he was holding in. Each opened mouth kiss conveyed the longing that they both felt. His veins were filled with adrenaline. The mere idea of tasting her lips was enough to drive him crazy but right now, he could barely restrain himself. \n\n He pulled her onto his lap, cupping her cheeks like it was the last thing he would ever hold dear to his heart.\n\nShe snagged at the ends of his hair, allowing to him groan against her mouth. The kiss was erotic and nothing like the soft and slow kiss Y/N dreamed it would be. Eventually the two of them stopped for air, leaning against each other.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou could have asked me a lot sooner, ya know?\u201d He panted, smiling dazedly at her. She rolled her eyes, leaning her head on his neck.<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get cocky now.\u201d She mumbled.<br></p><p>\u201cOh and for the record, I was not watching porn.\u201d Bucky stated, absentmindedly drawing shapes on her hip.<br></p><p>\u201cAnd what were you watching?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cProbably Dora the Explorer, or some shit.\u201d Sam piped up. Bucky and Y/N jumped at the intrusion, immediately scrambling away from each other.<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t act all Virgin Mary with me, I saw the sex eyes earlier. You two need to keep it at a minimum.\u201d Sam grumbled before waltzing out of the room, leaving the two love sick birds to their selves.<br></p></p>",
                "content": "<p><blockquote><p><b>Summary</b>: bucky is smitten and so are you. one sunburn later and y&rsquo;all have some &ldquo;fondue&rdquo; (i tried to make it rhyme but it didn&rsquo;t work)</p><p><b>Pairing(s)</b>: bucky barnes x reader</p><p><b>Requests</b>: open!</p><p><b>Word Count:</b> 1.8k</p><p><b>Warning(s)</b>: swearing, fluff</p></blockquote><hr /><p>It was hot. It was ridiculously hot. The California heat seemed to be extraordinary oppressive this morning and all Bucky could think of was ways to make his metal arm not accidentally brush against his skin. He had made that mistake four times this morning.&nbsp;\n\nTony had decided it was essential for the Avengers to take a getaway trip for the sake of sanity. Bucky called bullshit,&nbsp;\n\nclearly aware that Tony was postponing yet another Avengers meeting with Ross and Fury. Not that he minded.The team had spent the last month communicating with officials nearly everyday to organize plans, substantiate future missions, and debrief every and any inquiries from Maria Hill. The vacation was well deserved. But the climate made it feel more like a spa day gone wrong than a relaxing day at the beach.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Nat? I thought she and Y/N were going to get the drinks.&rdquo; Sam grumbled, rubbing more sunscreen on.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;She said that 20 minutes ago. I bet they&rsquo;re lounging in the bar. I know Tony&rsquo;s making drinks over there.&rdquo; Steve added, sinking deeper into his sun chair. Bucky turned around and squinted. Surely enough the two women sat perched on two bar-stools, entertaining Tony. The drinks were long forgotten.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re not wrong.&rdquo; Bucky muttered. Steve turned around before groaning.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hey what&rsquo;s the deal with you and Y/N anyway?&rdquo; Sam asked, turning towards Bucky. Steve raised an eyebrow at his friend.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I have no idea what you&rsquo;re talking about.&rdquo; Bucky stated, looking away. Steve looked at Sam in confusion.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something going on with Y/N and Bucky?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Bucky pursed his lips. There wasn&rsquo;t anything going on&hellip;<i>necessarily</i>. Bucky had developed a &ldquo;small attraction&rdquo; towards his team mate and there was nothing wrong with that. Until Sam found out. Bucky still regretted that day, thinking of a million different ways it could have gone with an outcome that was completely different. Sadly, no matter how much he dreamed, reality sucked and Sam would never not be a dick.</p><p><i>Y/N had just finished training with Natasha and was eager to ravage the fridge for anything that would satisfy her seemingly unquenchable appetite. Bucky sat on the sofa, his eyebrows knit in confusion.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Do you want me to turn on the television? I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;ll be way more interesting to stare at than just a blank screen.&rdquo; Y/N said, smiling lightly. Bucky blinked, now noticing the blank television.<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I was just thinking.&rdquo; He replied, blushing lightly. He had been pondering about her and how exactly he would ask her out.<b> This was much easier back in the 40s.</b><br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Ahh. Do you want anything from the fridge?&rdquo; Y/N asked, turning towards the kitchen. Bucky couldn&rsquo;t restrain his eyes from checking out the rest of her figure. He was so utterly drawn to her that he was sure she could make anything look beautiful. She turned around at his lack of response. Bucky flushed.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Just a bottle of water.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>Y/N hummed in response and Bucky began to panic. <b>It&rsquo;s now or never Barnes. </b>He got up quickly, his mind set on asking her out. He didn&rsquo;t realize a familiar well built man with a smirk waltz into the room.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Y/N, I was wondering if you would wanna-&rdquo;<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Hey manchurian candidate, whatcha got there?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>Bucky froze.<b> That son of a bitch.</b> He looked at Sam, his eyes narrowing at him. Sam looked at Y/N before looking back at Bucky, the wheels in his mind turning. <b>He knows.</b></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;A water bottle.&rdquo; Bucky said between his teeth.<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Y/N, could you toss me a granola bar?&rdquo; Sam asked, his shit eating grin only widening. Bucky only had one wish at that moment: make Sam Wilson disappear.<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Sure. Bucky, what were you saying?&rdquo; Y/N asked, tossing Sam a bar.&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I was thinking we could-&rdquo;<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Oh my god, was he going to tell you how I walked in on him watching porn? Dear god-&rdquo; Sam barked out in laughter. Bucky stared wide eyed, absolutely mortified.<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Y/N asked, clearly bewildered.<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I walked in on Bucky watching porn. It was hilarious and traumatizing.&rdquo; Sam snickered. Bucky tried to speak, but his voice betrayed him and all he could do was watch the horrifying scene unravel before him. He looked at Y/N, his eyes almost pleading her not to believe Sam. She let out a small chuckle, clearly uncomfortable. Bucky had never wanted to kill Sam more than he did in that moment.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great um. I&rsquo;ll sit this story out, see ya guys later.&rdquo;</i><br /></p><p>Bucky shook his head at the memory, the embarrassment still causing him to blush.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;No, Sam just likes to make up things.&rdquo; Bucky mumbled.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I do not! Old man&rsquo;s just saying that because he&rsquo;s sad he hasn&rsquo;t gotten a kiss since 19-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Are you asking for a black eye, because I am not afraid-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Guys settle down. Has it really been that long since you&rsquo;ve kissed someone Buck?&rdquo; Steve asked, clearly amused. Bucky looked away, his lips pressing into a fine line.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Liar!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s lying about what?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Natasha and Y/N suddenly came into view, a cooler in both of their hands. Steve let out a sigh of relief, violently taking the box from Natasha&rsquo;s hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Easy there. You&rsquo;re acting as if we were gone for an eternity.&rdquo; She said, taking a seat at the edge of Steve&rsquo;s sun chair.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because you guys <i>were </i>gone for an eternity.&rdquo; Bucky grumbled, cracking open a Milwaukee beer. Y/N took a seat beside him.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You guys are a bunch of divas. And who&rsquo;s a liar?&rdquo; She asked, crossing her legs.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Frozen Popsicle No.2 over there hasn&rsquo;t gotten a good ol&rsquo; smooch since the 20th century.&rdquo; Sam crooned, making kissing faces at Bucky. Using his metal arm, Bucky grabbed Sam&rsquo;s bicep causing him to shriek. Steve immediately set the fire out.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I highly doubt that.&rdquo; Y/N said, popping a pistachio in her mouth. Bucky raised an eyebrow at her.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Look at you. Who wouldn&rsquo;t want to make out with you?&rdquo; She stated before freezing. The four of them stared at her, their gazes unwavering. Y/N shrugged sheepishly.</p><p>&ldquo;Just putting it out there.&rdquo; She whispered, taking a giant sip of her beer. Bucky stared at her for another moment before clearing his throat.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Alright you two&hellip;save the sex eyes for later. I actually want to enjoy the vacation while it lasts.&rdquo; Sam quipped, causing them to laugh.&nbsp;</p><p>Bucky couldn&rsquo;t seem to get her out of his mind the rest of the day. He distanced himself from Y/N as much as he could, convincing himself her words were out of pity.
