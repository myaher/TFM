        "body": "<h1>GOT 8x05 Quick disorganized thoughts </h1><ul><li>Overall I liked the episode. There. We&rsquo;ve made that clear</li><li>No time jumping. No fast travel. Always a good point </li><li>Dark Dany. Yes. Yes. Yes. And no it wasn&rsquo;t OOC or too sudden. It&rsquo;s been there for seasons now. </li><li>All the action is concentrated in the South. Meaning no Winterfell and I kept wondering when were we gonna switch to the North. But smart choice</li><li>Miguel Sapochnik&rsquo;s direction is really the best. But I still place this one behind The Long Night and I maintain that Battle of the Bastards is still the best GOT episode. Ever </li><li>All episode long I kept thinking &lsquo;man Sansa would SO not approve any of this shit&rsquo;</li><li>'Sandor&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s it </li><li>Seriously I also disagree that Arya&rsquo;s character development was thrown away. That was always the point. To let her grow from all this rage and sense of vengeance that&rsquo;s been eating her alive since forever and let her become human again. Have her gain back a sense of humanity. That was what Maisie said her arc would be, finding that balance between Arya the girl she was and Arya the killing machine she has become </li><li>Cleganebowl. Of course they&rsquo;d save it until the end. And no I didn&rsquo;t find it anticlimactic. As much as I wanted Sandor to win, his brother is a fucking zombie. He cannot be killed like that. Sandor had an amazing character arc and his redemption climaxed here through his relationship with Arya. The last thing he needed to resolve was his brother and ultimately they were too linked to each other to survive. Neither could win properly and Sandor was not a good man either. A happy ending was never in the cards for him</li><li>The same applies for Jaime and Cersei. Call me crazy but I actually liked their ending. A bit melodramatic maybe ? But the whole episode portrays Cersei in a rather sympathetic way, far from the ruthless persona we&rsquo;ve seen before. This is partly to really portray Dany as the villain here. And the reasoning works here too. Jaime might be a redeemed man but he is not a good man. Neither is Cersei. There was no happy ending for them either</li><li>Though I thought that Jaime would kill Cersei I&rsquo;m glad that this is not what happened. Jaime and Cersei started the series and their lives together. It makes sense they would end it in a similar way. We knew that Cersei would die this episode. We didn&rsquo;t expect Jaime to be there with her nor the manner of death. But believe me or not I&rsquo;m actually satisfied. Having Dany kill Cersei would probably have been too much </li><li>Jaime recognizes that his relationship with Cersei is toxic and yet they&rsquo;re irredeemably intertwined and I was sold. By Lena and Nikolaj&rsquo;s acting solely</li><li>Dany finally alienates herself from Jon. Jon finally understands what his Queen is. Better late than never </li><li>Varys is betrayed by Tyrion. I didn&rsquo;t understand why&hellip; is Tyrion really this loyal to Dany ? Did he purposely blind himself until he couldn&rsquo;t anymore ? Jon is creeped out by the burning alive. He just couldn&rsquo;t do anything about it because he&rsquo;s afraid of Dany. The difference with Mance in S5 is he did something then because he wasn&rsquo;t afraid to stand up to Stannis </li><li>Lol how could so many Dothraki survive the charge against the wights ? </li><li>Greyworm loses it and he&rsquo;s seemingly gonna go up against Jon. But I understood where he came from. Missandei&rsquo;s passing was handled properly, both from Greyworm and Dany&rsquo;s side </li><li>Jon will have to rise up against Dany. He has no choice. Here for it but I really hope they don&rsquo;t pull the tragic love story card. Please confirm that Jon was not a stupid lovesick fool </li><li>Where will Arya go ? To find Jon ? Back North ? </li><li>Seriously it&rsquo;s been two major battles and we were robbed of Jon and Arya fighting alongside each other. I&rsquo;d have loved to see Jon being smacked at how good his baby sister has become </li><li>Jon saving the girl from rape indeed reminded me of Sansa&rsquo;s near rape scene. In fact that&rsquo;s not the only time I was reminded of Sansa. When Arya passes civilians there are many shots of girls in lady dresses and frightened non-fighters who reminded me of Sansa - who stands for this specific group of people. Maybe that was just me</li><li>Euron. Glad the fucker is done with. Kind of weirded out that Dany is able to take on his entire fleet and the whole of the ballistas this time around yet she was so ineffective in the last episode but ok. I was so happy Jaime killed him though I also wish Dany burned him </li><li>No Sansa vs Cersei showdown I guess. A tad disappointed</li><li>What happened with the scene where Jon kneels to Cersei ? So that wasn&rsquo;t a scene at all ? </li><li>Remembering that Sophie was incredibly satisfied with her ending. That she kept a spoilery scroll as a souvenir and that she was gifted the storyboard for her final scene. Excited to see what this is. Apparently Sophie filmed in Spain but perhaps she won&rsquo;t go south at all ? </li><li>Dany will want to deal with her though. And with Jon. She will come for the Starks. She wants to instigate fear but she knows Sansa is not afraid. Jon is or was up until this episode </li><li>The promo for the series finale focuses on Arya, Tyrion and Dany. Sansa isn&rsquo;t shown meaning they don&rsquo;t want to reveal anything on her scenes yet. And what they don&rsquo;t show us is usually the meaty part of the episodes  </li><li>That&rsquo;s it. More complete recap to come later </li><li>Oh and Ramin Djawadi really took a vacation between Ep3 and Ep5 because he&rsquo;s back at doing actual great music again</li></ul>",
