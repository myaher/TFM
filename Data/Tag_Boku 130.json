I do indeed have some favorite Ochako pairings and they are as follows:</p><p><b>Kacchako </b>- I think I mentioned in my fanfic rec post that this accidentally became one of my favorite pairings out of nowhere. they have only two interactions of any real significance in canon (and one of those interactions is only semi-canon, but I think the character book is a legit enough source), but damned if those interactions aren\u2019t shippable as fuck. they have so much to offer one another. Bakugou inspires Ochako to push herself to her limits. he took her seriously as an opponent in the sports festival, and that fight led to her deciding to intern with Gunhead\u2019s agency and becoming even more of a badass, which in turn has built her confidence. so he\u2019s indirectly responsible for a lot of her character growth. meanwhile, Ochako can see right through his tough guy posturing and isn\u2019t afraid to call him on his shit, which I <i>love</i>. so much, oh my god. and the best thing about it is that even when she gets angry with him, she\u2019s still Ochako and thus inherently pure and sweet, and so that anger is lined with an underlying care and concern. she wants him to be better because she\u2019s a good person and she cares about him and she knows he can be a better person too with just a little bit of effort. it\u2019s just a great dynamic with so much potential for them to bring out the best in each other.</p><p><b>BakuDekuOcha OT3<b> </b></b><b>Whatever You Call This</b> - okay, basically this is because I love her friendship with Deku and it\u2019s canon that she has feelings for him and I\u2019m not just going to ignore that lol. but. because I love Bakugou and Kacchako too as previously stated, I prefer this OT3 to regular ol\u2019 Dekuraka or whatever you call it. the combination of Deku + Ochako together has the potential to top the absolute <i>shit</i> out of Bakugou, and holy shit. basically this is one of my favorite pairings in the series, full stop.</p><p><b>Iidaraka</b> - MY ORIGINAL OCHAKO OTP. I STILL LOVE IT. I <i>adore </i>how they interact, and how she clearly thinks Iida is the cutest ever (because he <i>is</i>), and knows him so well, and they\u2019re just so comfortable with each other. and frankly, whoever is lucky enough to end up dating Iida Tenya had better be grateful for the rest of their damn lives. he would be <i>the</i> most devoted, loving, and adorably awkward boyfriend ever. meanwhile I think Ochako is one of the people that Iida relies on to steady himself. just like, a calming, loving, supportive presence, which is so essential when you\u2019re as naturally uptight as this 40-year-old android. so yeah, these two just click.</p><p><b>OchaTsu </b>- I think Tsuyu is Ochako\u2019s closest female friend in the series for sure. they\u2019re both founding members of the Dekusquad or whatever you call it, they both interned together, Ochako was the one Tsuyu trusted and relied on that first night in the dorms when Tsu was feeling miserable over what happened with the Bakurescue, and so on. they have got each other\u2019s back. probably the only reason I don\u2019t ship it more is because it\u2019s almost <i>too</i> healthy lol. if that even makes sense. basically, the only genre you could write for these two would be fluff, because there would never be any conflict between them. they are both too kind and caring and sensible and have their shit together lol. that being said, they are still great.</p><p>anyways, I think that\u2019s it for my biggest Ochako ships. these are the main ones because these are the characters have had the majority of interaction with her in canon. but honestly I think she\u2019d gel pretty well with just about anyone and I could probably be converted to just about any Ochaship tbh.</p>",

I do indeed have some favorite Ochako pairings and they are as follows:</p><p><b>Kacchako </b>- I think I mentioned in my fanfic rec post that this accidentally became one of my favorite pairings out of nowhere. they have only two interactions of any real significance in canon (and one of those interactions is only semi-canon, but I think the character book is a legit enough source), but damned if those interactions aren\u2019t shippable as fuck. they have so much to offer one another. Bakugou inspires Ochako to push herself to her limits. he took her seriously as an opponent in the sports festival, and that fight led to her deciding to intern with Gunhead\u2019s agency and becoming even more of a badass, which in turn has built her confidence. so he\u2019s indirectly responsible for a lot of her character growth. meanwhile, Ochako can see right through his tough guy posturing and isn\u2019t afraid to call him on his shit, which I <i>love</i>. so much, oh my god. and the best thing about it is that even when she gets angry with him, she\u2019s still Ochako and thus inherently pure and sweet, and so that anger is lined with an underlying care and concern. she wants him to be better because she\u2019s a good person and she cares about him and she knows he can be a better person too with just a little bit of effort. it\u2019s just a great dynamic with so much potential for them to bring out the best in each other.</p><p><b>BakuDekuOcha OT3<b> </b></b><b>Whatever You Call This</b> - okay, basically this is because I love her friendship with Deku and it\u2019s canon that she has feelings for him and I\u2019m not just going to ignore that lol. but. because I love Bakugou and Kacchako too as previously stated, I prefer this OT3 to regular ol\u2019 Dekuraka or whatever you call it. the combination of Deku + Ochako together has the potential to top the absolute <i>shit</i> out of Bakugou, and holy shit. basically this is one of my favorite pairings in the series, full stop.</p><p><b>Iidaraka</b> - MY ORIGINAL OCHAKO OTP. I STILL LOVE IT. I <i>adore </i>how they interact, and how she clearly thinks Iida is the cutest ever (because he <i>is</i>), and knows him so well, and they\u2019re just so comfortable with each other. and frankly, whoever is lucky enough to end up dating Iida Tenya had better be grateful for the rest of their damn lives. he would be <i>the</i> most devoted, loving, and adorably awkward boyfriend ever. meanwhile I think Ochako is one of the people that Iida relies on to steady himself. just like, a calming, loving, supportive presence, which is so essential when you\u2019re as naturally uptight as this 40-year-old android. so yeah, these two just click.</p><p><b>OchaTsu </b>- I think Tsuyu is Ochako\u2019s closest female friend in the series for sure. they\u2019re both founding members of the Dekusquad or whatever you call it, they both interned together, Ochako was the one Tsuyu trusted and relied on that first night in the dorms when Tsu was feeling miserable over what happened with the Bakurescue, and so on. they have got each other\u2019s back. probably the only reason I don\u2019t ship it more is because it\u2019s almost <i>too</i> healthy lol. if that even makes sense. basically, the only genre you could write for these two would be fluff, because there would never be any conflict between them. they are both too kind and caring and sensible and have their shit together lol. that being said, they are still great.</p><p>anyways, I think that\u2019s it for my biggest Ochako ships. these are the main ones because these are the characters have had the majority of interaction with her in canon. but honestly I think she\u2019d gel pretty well with just about anyone and I could probably be converted to just about any Ochaship tbh.</p>",
