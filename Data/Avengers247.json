Hope Pym is obviously valedictorian, and Steve Rogers is class president.</b><br/></li><li><b>Netflix characters are the juniors, since in real life they\u2019re widely regarded as the second-best. Medusa, Black Bolt, Karnak and Robbie Reyes are all in this class as they\u2019re older than their siblings.</b><br/></li><li><b>The Hulu/Freeform characters are the sophomores, since they\u2019re regarded as Netflix-lite. Shuri is part of this class, since she\u2019s younger than T\u2019Challa. Peter Parker\u2019s down here as well, since all of these characters are the same age as him.</b><br/></li><li><b>Agents of SHIELD and Inhumans characters are the freshman class, because SHIELD is underrated and slept on, while Inhumans had to fit somewhere.</b><br/></li></ol><p>What about Agent Carter? Well, the Agent Carter characters are the staff, as well as a few of the older movie characters. Peggy is principal (but still young enough to be the big sister of senior Sharon Carter), Jarvis is the computer class teacher (as a shout-out to J.A.R.V.I.S., who is present in the student body as Vision), Hank and Janet Pym teach chemistry and biology, respectively. Howard Stark teaches shop class. Erik Selvig teaches astronomy. Daniel Sousa teaches history, while Jack Thompson teaches Home Economics (yes, I made him in charge of that). Angie Martinelli is the drama teacher. Dottie Underwood is the school nurse. Rose Roberts is the vice-principal. Ana Jarvis is the guidance counselor. Jason Wilkes teaches physics. Nick Fury is the gym teacher, and he lost his eye due to a rogue dodgeball. Aloysius Samberly is the crotchety math teacher with a heart of gold.</p><p>Headcanons:</p><ul><li>Senior Class Treasurer Natasha Romanoff was inspired by Nurse Underwood\u2019s martial arts background to start the Black Widow self-defense club at school. Members include fellow seniors Maria Hill, Brunnhilde, Nebula and Gamora, juniors Colleen Wing, Claire Temple, Trish Walker and Medusalith Amaquelin, sophomores Tandy Bowen and Molly Hernandez, and freshmen Melinda May, Daisy Johnson, Elena Rodriguez and Crystalia Amaquelin.<br/></li><li>Despite being in a long-term relationship with head cheerleader Sharon Carter, there\u2019s been a pervasive rumor that star quarterback Steve Rogers is actually dating notorious troublemaker Jamie Barnes. (Spoiler alert: It\u2019s true, but Sharon doesn\u2019t mind covering for her best friend due to living in the small town of Marville.)</li><li>Jamie Barnes is part of The Punishers, a gang consisting of Loki Odinson, Elektra Natchios, Grant Ward, Maximus Boltagon, Pietro and Wanda Maximoff, Brigid O\u2019Reilly, Jessica Jones, Daisy Johnson, Robbie Reyes, Ava Starr, Gamora, Nebula, Auran, Mordis and their leader, Frank Castle. The Punishers are a very close-knit group and despite the appearance of vandals, they actually commit acts of kindness and charity. With the occasional heavy-handed prank to maintain their notorious reputation, of course.</li><li>Matt Murdock, the school\u2019s premiere gymnast, is known to associate with Elektra Natchios and Frank Castle, and though romantically linked to the head of the drama club, Karen Page, it is believed he\u2019s carrying on an affair with Castle. (Spoiler alert: Matt is bisexual as fuck and is flirting with all of them. But Frank wins his heart in the end.)</li><li>The whole school was rocked when Nico Minoru and Karolina Dean came out as a couple. They were rocked again when Tyrone Johnson and Tandy Bowen, and later Jessica Jones and Luke Cage came out as couples. Not because all three were interracial relationships, with one even being a lesbian couple, but because they were so adorable.</li><li>After losing his arm in an accident, Phil Coulson created a club for students with prosthetics. Members include Misty Knight, Elena Rodriguez, and the Punishers Jamie Barnes and Nebula, and even Mr. Sousa as the staff sponsor. Additional members include Melinda May, Alphonso Mackenzie, Colleen Wing, Steven Rogers, Gamora and Principal Carter supporting their respective loved ones.</li><li>Trish Walker and Karen Page are best friends due to bonding in both drama class and journalism class. Trish\u2019s adoptive sister, Jessica Jones, also takes the journalism class and is friendly with fellow classmates David Lieberman, Daisy Johnson, and Darcy Lewis.</li><li>Daisy Johnson is the foster sister of Matt Murdock, and fully supports his burgeoning relationship with Castle, while initiating one of her own with Robbie Reyes, much to the chagrin of her friends Lincoln Campbell and Deke Shaw.</li><li>Joey Gutierrez and Jeri Hogarth are the co-presidents of the school\u2019s GSA. Members and allies include Nico Minoru, Karolina Dean, Gert Yorkes, Loki Odinson, <b>Jack Rogers*</b>, <b>Bobo Smith*</b>, Steven Rogers, Jamie Barnes, Sharon Carter, Frank Castle, Matt Murdock, Daisy Johnson, Brunnhilde and Korg.</li></ul><p>*For the most part, I\u2019m talking about main or recurring characters, not so much dead/minor characters, but I love these two, so fight me.</p>",

He had equipped it with nanotech, allowing her quick access to her updated suit.\u00a0 She latched the small watch onto her wrist.<i> Better safe than sorry.</i></p><p>The kitchen was surprisingly empty.

Always one to look out for others.</i></p><p>\u201cThanks but I think I\u2019ll be fine. I should be home by then.\u201d<br/></p><p>Steve nodded and it was quiet again. The silence was plagued by awkwardness. Steve\u2019s mind swarmed with half formed regrets. Her yellow sundress reminded him of their first date and how she had yellow frosting on her bottom lip. He recalled her embarrassed laugh when he lightly swiped the frosting from the cupcake away. He remembered having her scarred hands press against his chest as they swayed to the dingy restaurant\u2019s Walkman. He remembered the way her laugh resonated when he whispered about his favorite memories with the Howling Commandos. He remembered the soft kiss she pressed against his cheek and the light squeeze on his bicep when he led her back to her room in the compound.\u00a0Steve pressed his lips into a fine line.</p><p>\u201cTake care.\u201d<br/></p><p>Y/N graced him with a small smile before shrugging on a coat. He could feel the familiar rush of blood to his cheeks. He missed her smile.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d<br/></p><p>Steve turned on his heel, deciding to not let the stuffy silence encompass the two of them again.<i> </i>He had to move on. It was <i>his </i>fault for leaving her after all-</p><p><i>\u201cOuch!\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d<br/></p><p>It appeared as if Y/N\u2019s face was stuck to the strap of her dress and it took a great amount of restraint for Steve to not laugh.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s this goddamn earring. Tell Wanda that she and her earrings can fuck off.\u201d Y/N hissed, frantically trying to free her ear lobe from the cloth.<br/></p><p>\u201cOkay okay hold on. You\u2019re gonna get yourself hurt. Let me do it.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Steve gently pried her fingers away from her face.\u00a0Y/N stared at him wide eyed, now aware of how close he was. His fingers ghosted against her cheek momentarily.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>His voice was incredibly soft, barely above a whisper. His fingers deliberately brushed her cheek and he momentarily stopped.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSteve?\u201d<br/></p><p>He didn\u2019t respond, his fingers trailing dangerously close to her lips. The feeling was so familiar,Y/N felt a small tug on her heartstrings and she closed her eyes.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSorry. Just uh-no-sorry.\u201d Steve had seemingly jumped at least three feet back, clasping his hands together. Y/N blinked at the sudden loss of contact. She ducked her head in shame.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201c\u2019s all right.\u201d<br/></p><p>Steve watched her leave, swallowing the painful thick lump lodged in his throat.</p><p>***</p><p>Julian Gilford was <i>nice</i>. He smelled like magnolias and wore a pressed suit, despite the rather colloquial date. He smiled a little too wide and breathed a little too deeply, but he was <i>nice</i>. Y/N played her cards right, smiling at the right moments and laughing at his corny jokes. She <i>tried </i>to like him. She earnestly did. But his hair was a shade too dark for blonde and his build was <i>too </i>lanky and she couldn\u2019t stop herself from comparing Julian to <i>him</i>. Y/N grit her teeth, grasping the menu tightly.</p><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Julian peered at her from his menu. She exhaled sharply through her nose. His eyes weren\u2019t<i> </i>the <i>right </i>shade of<i> </i>blue.</p><p>\u201cGreat! Have you tried the garlic and rosemary foccacia? I heard it\u2019s too die for.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>And so the rest of the date went like that. Bland references to bland jobs. Y/N had felt terrible.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c-and I said John, it\u2019s the phone book you\u2019re looking for!\u201d Julian said, clutching his chest as he burst out laughing. Y/N forced a laugh before pausing. Her wrist throbbed with a sudden jolt. Furrowing her eyebrows, she peered at her watch. It began to flash. <i>Incoming</i>.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d excuse me.\u201d Y/N nearly bolted towards the bathroom, shoving her ear piece on.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cTony? What\u2019s going on?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Y/N tapped on the watch. Her black suit spread on her skin\u00a0 quickly like paint\u00a0 dripping on a white canvas.</p><p>\u201cPhone book puns? Really?\u201d Steve\u2019s voice crackled on the intercom and Y/N froze.<br/></p><p>\u201cHave you been eavesdropping on me, Rogers?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNot at all ma\u2019am. Just keepin\u2019 a check on the civilians.\u201d There was amusement laced in his voice and Y/N couldn\u2019t hide the smile that began to form on her lips or stop the butterflies in her stomach.</p><p>\u201cNat reported sightings of two HYDRA henchmen with blueprints of some unidentified project. Strike \u2018em and grab the papers.\u201d He muttered. Y/N stealthily made her way out of the restaurant.</p><p>\u201cDamn, you were right. It\u2019s pouring.\u201d Y/N grumbled, sprinting to the nearest corridor. The pouring rain made it difficult for her to spot the familiar blonde.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI warned you. If you listened to me once in a while-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNot happening.\u201d She mused before freezing. The familiar tingling in her chest heightened as she etched towards the end of the alley. <i>He must be here.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cThis reminds me of the mission dates we used to go on.\u201d Steve muttered. Y/N held her breath.\u00a0The intercom was momentarily quiet before she could hear his short breaths.</p><p>\u201cYeah but you\u2019d have always had to have it your way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe-<i>agh</i>-that\u2019s why-<i>umph</i>-we broke-<i>argh</i>-up. Son of a- he doesn\u2019t even have the blue print.\u201d Steve panted. Y/N held her breath. She could almost feel the heat from the HYDRA agent\u2019s body.\u00a0<i>He must be here now. </i>Quickly, Y/N grabbed the nearby pipe. The figure\u2019s shadow came closer and closer before she could make out his features.</p><p><i>\u201cJulian?!\u201d</i><br/></p><p>\u201cJulian?\u201d Steve echoed in the intercom.<br/></p><p>The dirty blonde froze momentarily. Y/N studied his suit, looking for the familiar HYDRA patch before catching it underneath his breast pocket. <i>X Ray illuminated. </i>Y/N grinned, despite the situation. <i>He\u2019s smart.</i></p><p>\u201cYou know me?\u201d He asked bewildered and Y/N forgot about the mask her suit came with. Without a second thought, she struck at his sternum before drop kicking him. Taking advantage of his moment of weakness, she pounced onto the nearby light pole and swung herself away.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it. Where are you?\u201d Y/N huffed.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cNext to the telephone booth on your left. Is Julian your date?\u201d<br/></p><p>Y/N rolled her eyes, smiling despite herself. She made her way towards the super soldier and tapped twice on the watch. Her sunflower dress now clung to her skin as the rain pounded harder.</p><p>\u201cYeah. You go on a date after several months only to find out he\u2019s a HYDRA agent. What are the odds.\u201d She chuckled, attempting to press herself into the booth. Steve raised his shield above her head and smiled.<br/></p><p>\u201cMay not be an umbrella but sure as hell works as one.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0Y/N hummed in response, laying her head on his shoulder. She would have yanked herself away if it weren\u2019t for how calm she felt at that moment.</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d<br/></p><p>Steve felt his throat close up on him. The familiar weight of her head on his shoulder reminded him of their past dates and he felt his heart begin to race. He could smell the jasmine perfume he loved so much.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI-\u201d He swallowed, inhaling deeply.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat do you say we try things out again?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She removed her head from his shoulder and glanced up at him. His bright cerulean irises were now dark and heavy with emotions she couldn\u2019t identify.<br/></p><p>\u201cI want to do this right. I know it wasn\u2019t right to tell you that we should call things off simply because of<i> our day job</i>. I know I shouldn\u2019t have pushed you away like that. I know this seems like I\u2019m just saying this because I\u2019m jealous of you and Julian- which I am not by the way, if you\u2019re happy with him, even though he\u2019s a HYDRA agent-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cSteve.\u201d Y/N said sternly, placing her hand on his free arm. He shook his head, taking a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to say is. You\u2019re so amazing, Y/N and I\u2019m so dumb for letting you go and God, I just- I am so in love with you.\u201d Steve bent his head down, staring at the wet concrete. He felt the familiar numb feeling of his heart ache.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>So in love with you it hurts</i>.<i> And I\u2019m so dumb for letting you g</i>o\u201d He whispered. Y/N froze. She felt her heart swell and the blood rush to her cheeks. With a shaky hand, she softly cupped his jaw, urging him to look at her.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou know how long I\u2019ve been waiting to hear that? It\u2019s been several goddamn months Steven, you took your time.\u201d She quipped and grinned as she watched a small smile form on his lips. Tentatively, she placed her lips on his and hummed. A sense of familiarity flooded her body and she couldn\u2019t help but smile, tugging his body closer to hers. Steve sighed against her mouth, the familiarity of her soft lips easing the ache in his heart. He felt almost drunk with the feeling of her body this close to his. Slowly, Y/N parted away for breath. She felt giddy with the sudden rush of adrenaline. Steve\u2019s swollen lips formed into a smile as he rested his hand on the curve of her hip.<br/></p><p>\u201cAre you in the mood for cupcakes?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cGlad you asked Cap, I was thinking we should hit Clementine\u2019s.\u201d<br/></p>",

The familiar tingling in her chest heightened as she etched towards the end of the alley. <i>He must be here.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cThis reminds me of the mission dates we used to go on.\u201d Steve muttered. Y/N held her breath.\u00a0The intercom was momentarily quiet before she could hear his short breaths.</p><p>\u201cYeah but you\u2019d have always had to have it your way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe-<i>agh</i>-that\u2019s why-<i>umph</i>-we broke-<i>argh</i>-up. Son of a- he doesn\u2019t even have the blue print.\u201d Steve panted. Y/N held her breath. She could almost feel the heat from the HYDRA agent\u2019s body.\u00a0<i>He must be here now. </i>Quickly, Y/N grabbed the nearby pipe. The figure\u2019s shadow came closer and closer before she could make out his features.</p><p><i>\u201cJulian?!\u201d</i><br></p><p>\u201cJulian?\u201d Steve echoed in the intercom.<br></p><p>The dirty blonde froze momentarily. Y/N studied his suit, looking for the familiar HYDRA patch before catching it underneath his breast pocket. <i>X Ray illuminated. </i>Y/N grinned, despite the situation. <i>He\u2019s smart.</i></p><p>\u201cYou know me?\u201d He asked bewildered and Y/N forgot about the mask her suit came with. Without a second thought, she struck at his sternum before drop kicking him. Taking advantage of his moment of weakness, she pounced onto the nearby light pole and swung herself away.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it. Where are you?\u201d Y/N huffed.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNext to the telephone booth on your left. Is Julian your date?\u201d<br></p><p>Y/N rolled her eyes, smiling despite herself. She made her way towards the super soldier and tapped twice on the watch. Her sunflower dress now clung to her skin as the rain pounded harder.</p><p>\u201cYeah. You go on a date after several months only to find out he\u2019s a HYDRA agent. What are the odds.\u201d She chuckled, attempting to press herself into the booth. Steve raised his shield above her head and smiled.<br></p><p>\u201cMay not be an umbrella but sure as hell works as one.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0Y/N hummed in response, laying her head on his shoulder. She would have yanked herself away if it weren\u2019t for how calm she felt at that moment.</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d<br></p><p>Steve felt his throat close up on him. The familiar weight of her head on his shoulder reminded him of their past dates and he felt his heart begin to race. He could smell the jasmine perfume he loved so much.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI-\u201d He swallowed, inhaling deeply.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat do you say we try things out again?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She removed her head from his shoulder and glanced up at him. His bright cerulean irises were now dark and heavy with emotions she couldn\u2019t identify.<br></p><p>\u201cI want to do this right. I know it wasn\u2019t right to tell you that we should call things off simply because of<i> our day job</i>. I know I shouldn\u2019t have pushed you away like that. I know this seems like I\u2019m just saying this because I\u2019m jealous of you and Julian- which I am not by the way, if you\u2019re happy with him, even though he\u2019s a HYDRA agent-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSteve.\u201d Y/N said sternly, placing her hand on his free arm. He shook his head, taking a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to say is. You\u2019re so amazing, Y/N and I\u2019m so dumb for letting you go and God, I just- I am so in love with you.\u201d Steve bent his head down, staring at the wet concrete. He felt the familiar numb feeling of his heart ache.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201c<i>So in love with you it hurts</i>.<i> And I\u2019m so dumb for letting you g</i>o\u201d He whispered. Y/N froze. She felt her heart swell and the blood rush to her cheeks. With a shaky hand, she softly cupped his jaw, urging him to look at her.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou know how long I\u2019ve been waiting to hear that? It\u2019s been several goddamn months Steven, you took your time.\u201d She quipped and grinned as she watched a small smile form on his lips. Tentatively, she placed her lips on his and hummed. A sense of familiarity flooded her body and she couldn\u2019t help but smile, tugging his body closer to hers. Steve sighed against her mouth, the familiarity of her soft lips easing the ache in his heart. He felt almost drunk with the feeling of her body this close to his. Slowly, Y/N parted away for breath. She felt giddy with the sudden rush of adrenaline. Steve\u2019s swollen lips formed into a smile as he rested his hand on the curve of her hip.<br></p><p>\u201cAre you in the mood for cupcakes?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cGlad you asked Cap, I was thinking we should hit Clementine\u2019s.\u201d<br></p></p>",

Earrings were never her thing. Wanda had persuaded her into buying a couple pairs just in case an occasion rose. And well, it did.\u00a0\n\nShe carefully slipped the hoop through her piercing and backed away from the mirror. The yellow sundress seemed a little too bright and the nude lipstick seemed a little too\u2026<i>bland.\u00a0</i>She scrunched her nose. <i>First date in several months and you already look like a tarnished version of Emma Stone on the front cover of Cosmopolitan. </i>She sighed and strapped on her wedges.<br></p><p>The compound had been eerily quiet for the past month. No mission reports. No unaccounted HYDRA bases to investigate. No rogue scientists with a burning passion to end the world. Nothing. It made her skin crawl with anticipation. Y/N eyed her watch with unease. Tony had gifted her the watch last month as an early birthday gift. He had equipped it with nanotech, allowing her quick access to her updated suit.\u00a0 She latched the small watch onto her wrist.<i> Better safe than sorry.</i></p><p>The kitchen was surprisingly empty. She had anticipated the loud laughter from Sam and Bucky or the quiet chatter between Tony and Bruce. But no one was there. Frowning, she grabbed a water bottle from the fridge.</p><p>\u201cHeadin\u2019 out?\u201d<br></p><p>Y/N let a small shriek. Steve stood perched against the granite counter. An amused smile adorned his rose colored lips and he cocked his head to the side. Y/N swallowed. It had been several months and she still couldn\u2019t shake off the butterflies.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a date.\u201d<br></p><p>The phrase felt foreign on her tongue. Steve\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change and Y/N couldn\u2019t tell if she was happy with that or not. She thought, after a moment, that it was <i>good</i>. It meant <i>progress</i>. It meant that he had already moved on and that he was okay with <i>this.</i> Whatever <i>this </i>was.Y/N swallowed hard and set the bottle on the counter, avoiding his gaze<i>. S</i>he\u00a0had missed the slight jut in his jaw and shift in posture. She had missed the momentary forlorn expression. She had missed all the clear indications that contradicted her thoughts. Steve cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like it might rain in a bit. Clouds are lookin\u2019 a bit gray. You might wanna carry an umbrella.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0Y/N smiled at him fondly, ignoring the sad tug on her heart<i>. Always one to look out for others.</i></p><p>\u201cThanks but I think I\u2019ll be fine. I should be home by then.\u201d<br></p><p>Steve nodded and it was quiet again. The silence was plagued by awkwardness. Steve\u2019s mind swarmed with half formed regrets. Her yellow sundress reminded him of their first date and how she had yellow frosting on her bottom lip. He recalled her embarrassed laugh when he lightly swiped the frosting from the cupcake away. He remembered having her scarred hands press against his chest as they swayed to the dingy restaurant\u2019s Walkman. He remembered the way her laugh resonated when he whispered about his favorite memories with the Howling Commandos. He remembered the soft kiss she pressed against his cheek and the light squeeze on his bicep when he led her back to her room in the compound.\u00a0Steve pressed his lips into a fine line.</p><p>\u201cTake care.\u201d<br></p><p>Y/N graced him with a small smile before shrugging on a coat. He could feel the familiar rush of blood to his cheeks. He missed her smile.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d<br></p><p>Steve turned on his heel, deciding to not let the stuffy silence encompass the two of them again.<i> </i>He had to move on. It was <i>his </i>fault for leaving her after all-</p><p><i>\u201cOuch!\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d<br></p><p>It appeared as if Y/N\u2019s face was stuck to the strap of her dress and it took a great amount of restraint for Steve to not laugh.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s this goddamn earring. Tell Wanda that she and her earrings can fuck off.\u201d Y/N hissed, frantically trying to free her ear lobe from the cloth.<br></p><p>\u201cOkay okay hold on. You\u2019re gonna get yourself hurt. Let me do it.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Steve gently pried her fingers away from her face.\u00a0Y/N stared at him wide eyed, now aware of how close he was. His fingers ghosted against her cheek momentarily.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>His voice was incredibly soft, barely above a whisper. His fingers deliberately brushed her cheek and he momentarily stopped.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSteve?\u201d<br></p><p>He didn\u2019t respond, his fingers trailing dangerously close to her lips. The feeling was so familiar,Y/N felt a small tug on her heartstrings and she closed her eyes.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSorry. Just uh-no-sorry.\u201d Steve had seemingly jumped at least three feet back, clasping his hands together. Y/N blinked at the sudden loss of contact. She ducked her head in shame.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201c\u2019s all right.\u201d<br></p><p>Steve watched her leave, swallowing the painful thick lump lodged in his throat.</p><p>***</p><p>Julian Gilford was <i>nice</i>.

                "content": "<p><blockquote><p><b>Summary: </b>steve broke up with you several months ago because of the responsibilities of being an Avenger the two of you shared. but that ends up biting him in the ass.</p><p><b>Pairing(s)</b>: steve rogers x enhanced!reader</p><p><b>Requests:</b> open!</p><p><b>Word Count</b>: 1.9k</p><p><b>Warning(s)</b>: bit of angst but still fluffy :)</p><p><b>Note</b>: there&rsquo;s no set time line here lmao i mentioned nanotech but steve still has his shield so um whoops-</p></blockquote><hr /><p>The cool metal pricked Y/N&rsquo;s skin and she winced, cursing at the artificial accessory. Earrings were never her thing. Wanda had persuaded her into buying a couple pairs just in case an occasion rose. And well, it did.&nbsp;\n\nShe carefully slipped the hoop through her piercing and backed away from the mirror. The yellow sundress seemed a little too bright and the nude lipstick seemed a little too&hellip;<i>bland.&nbsp;</i>She scrunched her nose. <i>First date in several months and you already look like a tarnished version of Emma Stone on the front cover of Cosmopolitan. </i>She sighed and strapped on her wedges.<br /></p><p>The compound had been eerily quiet for the past month. No mission reports. No unaccounted HYDRA bases to investigate. No rogue scientists with a burning passion to end the world. Nothing. It made her skin crawl with anticipation. Y/N eyed her watch with unease. Tony had gifted her the watch last month as an early birthday gift. He had equipped it with nanotech, allowing her quick access to her updated suit.&nbsp; She latched the small watch onto her wrist.<i> Better safe than sorry.</i></p><p>The kitchen was surprisingly empty. She had anticipated the loud laughter from Sam and Bucky or the quiet chatter between Tony and Bruce. But no one was there. Frowning, she grabbed a water bottle from the fridge.</p><p>&ldquo;Headin&rsquo; out?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Y/N let a small shriek. Steve stood perched against the granite counter. An amused smile adorned his rose colored lips and he cocked his head to the side. Y/N swallowed. It had been several months and she still couldn&rsquo;t shake off the butterflies.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a date.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>The phrase felt foreign on her tongue. Steve&rsquo;s expression didn&rsquo;t change and Y/N couldn&rsquo;t tell if she was happy with that or not. She thought, after a moment, that it was <i>good</i>. It meant <i>progress</i>. It meant that he had already moved on and that he was okay with <i>this.</i> Whatever <i>this </i>was.Y/N swallowed hard and set the bottle on the counter, avoiding his gaze<i>. S</i>he&nbsp;had missed the slight jut in his jaw and shift in posture. She had missed the momentary forlorn expression. She had missed all the clear indications that contradicted her thoughts. Steve cleared his throat.</p><p>&ldquo;It looks like it might rain in a bit. Clouds are lookin&rsquo; a bit gray. You might wanna carry an umbrella.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Y/N smiled at him fondly, ignoring the sad tug on her heart<i>. Always one to look out for others.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Thanks but I think I&rsquo;ll be fine. I should be home by then.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Steve nodded and it was quiet again. The silence was plagued by awkwardness. Steve&rsquo;s mind swarmed with half formed regrets. Her yellow sundress reminded him of their first date and how she had yellow frosting on her bottom lip. He recalled her embarrassed laugh when he lightly swiped the frosting from the cupcake away. He remembered having her scarred hands press against his chest as they swayed to the dingy restaurant&rsquo;s Walkman. He remembered the way her laugh resonated when he whispered about his favorite memories with the Howling Commandos. He remembered the soft kiss she pressed against his cheek and the light squeeze on his bicep when he led her back to her room in the compound.&nbsp;Steve pressed his lips into a fine line.</p><p>&ldquo;Take care.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Y/N graced him with a small smile before shrugging on a coat. He could feel the familiar rush of blood to his cheeks. He missed her smile.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I will.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Steve turned on his heel, deciding to not let the stuffy silence encompass the two of them again.<i> </i>He had to move on. It was <i>his </i>fault for leaving her after all-</p><p><i>&ldquo;Ouch!&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Y/N?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>It appeared as if Y/N&rsquo;s face was stuck to the strap of her dress and it took a great amount of restraint for Steve to not laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this goddamn earring. Tell Wanda that she and her earrings can fuck off.&rdquo; Y/N hissed, frantically trying to free her ear lobe from the cloth.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Okay okay hold on. You&rsquo;re gonna get yourself hurt. Let me do it.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Steve gently pried her fingers away from her face.&nbsp;Y/N stared at him wide eyed, now aware of how close he was. His fingers ghosted against her cheek momentarily.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Got it.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>His voice was incredibly soft, barely above a whisper. His fingers deliberately brushed her cheek and he momentarily stopped.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Steve?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>He didn&rsquo;t respond, his fingers trailing dangerously close to her lips. The feeling was so familiar,Y/N felt a small tug on her heartstrings and she closed her eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry. Just uh-no-sorry.&rdquo; Steve had seemingly jumped at least three feet back, clasping his hands together. Y/N blinked at the sudden loss of contact. She ducked her head in shame.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Steve watched her leave, swallowing the painful thick lump lodged in his throat.</p><p>***</p><p>Julian Gilford was <i>nice</i>. He smelled like magnolias and wore a pressed suit, despite the rather colloquial date. He smiled a little too wide and breathed a little too deeply, but he was <i>nice</i>. Y/N played her cards right, smiling at the right moments and laughing at his corny jokes. She <i>tried </i>to like him. She earnestly did. But his hair was a shade too dark for blonde and his build was <i>too </i>lanky and she couldn&rsquo;t stop herself from comparing Julian to <i>him</i>. Y/N grit her teeth, grasping the menu tightly.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you alright?&rdquo; Julian peered at her from his menu. She exhaled sharply through her nose. His eyes weren&rsquo;t<i> </i>the <i>right </i>shade of<i> </i>blue.</p><p>&ldquo;Great! Have you tried the garlic and rosemary foccacia? I heard it&rsquo;s too die for.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>And so the rest of the date went like that. Bland references to bland jobs. Y/N had felt terrible.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;-and I said John, it&rsquo;s the phone book you&rsquo;re looking for!&rdquo; Julian said, clutching his chest as he burst out laughing. Y/N forced a laugh before pausing. Her wrist throbbed with a sudden jolt. Furrowing her eyebrows, she peered at her watch. It began to flash. <i>Incoming</i>.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;d excuse me.&rdquo; Y/N nearly bolted towards the bathroom, shoving her ear piece on.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Tony? What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Y/N tapped on the watch. Her black suit spread on her skin&nbsp; quickly like paint&nbsp; dripping on a white canvas.</p><p>&ldquo;Phone book puns? Really?&rdquo; Steve&rsquo;s voice crackled on the intercom and Y/N froze.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Have you been eavesdropping on me, Rogers?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Not at all ma&rsquo;am. Just keepin&rsquo; a check on the civilians.&rdquo; There was amusement laced in his voice and Y/N couldn&rsquo;t hide the smile that began to form on her lips or stop the butterflies in her stomach.</p><p>&ldquo;Nat reported sightings of two HYDRA henchmen with blueprints of some unidentified project. Strike &lsquo;em and grab the papers.&rdquo; He muttered. Y/N stealthily made her way out of the restaurant.</p><p>&ldquo;Damn, you were right. It&rsquo;s pouring.&rdquo; Y/N grumbled, sprinting to the nearest corridor. The pouring rain made it difficult for her to spot the familiar blonde.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I warned you. If you listened to me once in a while-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Not happening.&rdquo; She mused before freezing. The familiar tingling in her chest heightened as she etched towards the end of the alley. <i>He must be here.&nbsp;</i></p><p>&ldquo;This reminds me of the mission dates we used to go on.&rdquo; Steve muttered. Y/N held her breath.&nbsp;The intercom was momentarily quiet before she could hear his short breaths.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah but you&rsquo;d have always had to have it your way.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe-<i>agh</i>-that&rsquo;s why-<i>umph</i>-we broke-<i>argh</i>-up. Son of a- he doesn&rsquo;t even have the blue print.&rdquo; Steve panted. Y/N held her breath. She could almost feel the heat from the HYDRA agent&rsquo;s body.&nbsp;<i>He must be here now. </i>Quickly, Y/N grabbed the nearby pipe. The figure&rsquo;s shadow came closer and closer before she could make out his features.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Julian?!&rdquo;</i><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Julian?&rdquo; Steve echoed in the intercom.<br /></p><p>The dirty blonde froze momentarily. Y/N studied his suit, looking for the familiar HYDRA patch before catching it underneath his breast pocket. <i>X Ray illuminated. </i>Y/N grinned, despite the situation. <i>He&rsquo;s smart.</i></p><p>&ldquo;You know me?&rdquo; He asked bewildered and Y/N forgot about the mask her suit came with. Without a second thought, she struck at his sternum before drop kicking him. Taking advantage of his moment of weakness, she pounced onto the nearby light pole and swung herself away.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it. Where are you?&rdquo; Y/N huffed.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Next to the telephone booth on your left. Is Julian your date?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Y/N rolled her eyes, smiling despite herself. She made her way towards the super soldier and tapped twice on the watch. Her sunflower dress now clung to her skin as the rain pounded harder.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. You go on a date after several months only to find out he&rsquo;s a HYDRA agent. What are the odds.&rdquo; She chuckled, attempting to press herself into the booth. Steve raised his shield above her head and smiled.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;May not be an umbrella but sure as hell works as one.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Y/N hummed in response, laying her head on his shoulder. She would have yanked herself away if it weren&rsquo;t for how calm she felt at that moment.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Steve felt his throat close up on him. The familiar weight of her head on his shoulder reminded him of their past dates and he felt his heart begin to race. He could smell the jasmine perfume he loved so much.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I-&rdquo; He swallowed, inhaling deeply.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What do you say we try things out again?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; She removed her head from his shoulder and glanced up at him. His bright cerulean irises were now dark and heavy with emotions she couldn&rsquo;t identify.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I want to do this right. I know it wasn&rsquo;t right to tell you that we should call things off simply because of<i> our day job</i>. I know I shouldn&rsquo;t have pushed you away like that. I know this seems like I&rsquo;m just saying this because I&rsquo;m jealous of you and Julian- which I am not by the way, if you&rsquo;re happy with him, even though he&rsquo;s a HYDRA agent-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Steve.&rdquo; Y/N said sternly, placing her hand on his free arm. He shook his head, taking a deep breath.</p><p>&ldquo;What I&rsquo;m trying to say is. You&rsquo;re so amazing, Y/N and I&rsquo;m so dumb for letting you go and God, I just- I am so in love with you.&rdquo; Steve bent his head down, staring at the wet concrete. He felt the familiar numb feeling of his heart ache.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>So in love with you it hurts</i>.<i> And I&rsquo;m so dumb for letting you g</i>o&rdquo; He whispered. Y/N froze. She felt her heart swell and the blood rush to her cheeks. With a shaky hand, she softly cupped his jaw, urging him to look at her.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You know how long I&rsquo;ve been waiting to hear that? It&rsquo;s been several goddamn months Steven, you took your time.&rdquo; She quipped and grinned as she watched a small smile form on his lips. Tentatively, she placed her lips on his and hummed. A sense of familiarity flooded her body and she couldn&rsquo;t help but smile, tugging his body closer to hers. Steve sighed against her mouth, the familiarity of her soft lips easing the ache in his heart. He felt almost drunk with the feeling of her body this close to his. Slowly, Y/N parted away for breath. She felt giddy with the sudden rush of adrenaline. Steve&rsquo;s swollen lips formed into a smile as he rested his hand on the curve of her hip.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Are you in the mood for cupcakes?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Glad you asked Cap, I was thinking we should hit Clementine&rsquo;s.&rdquo;<br /></p></p>",

I\u2019ve never met anyone without one before.\u201d</p><p>How was he supposed to explain this? With most people, he\ncould simply tell them his story, or parts of it anyway; most people found out\neventually anyway. But with you, he was afraid you would think he was lying or\nbe scared off.

Telling you why he hadn\u2019t\nexpected to have a soulmate would lead to what he did for HYDRA, and while\nlogically he knew none of it had been his fault, he still didn\u2019t really believe\nthat.

Please don\u2019t leave.\u201d He squeezed your hand. \u201cI promise it will all\nmake sense once the conference is over.\u201d</p><p>You nodded. There was something in his tone that made you\nwant to trust what he told you. You shivered a bit as he pulled away, missing\nhis warmth already.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you after the conference,\u201d you whispered.</p><p>James leaned down to place a kiss on your forehead. \u201cI\u2019ll be\nback.

You wrapped your arm around yourself\nand prayed he\u2019d be back.</p><p>\u201cDid he just\u2026 leave you?\u201d Jon sounded scandalized as he came\nback over to you, his fianc\u00e9e trailing behind him.</p><p>Margie frowned at him. \u201cJon, we really need to invest in a\n\u2018think before you speak\u2019 filter for your mouth.\u201d</p><p>Your eyes were still lingering on the stage, the direction\nin which James had disappeared. \u201cHe said to watch the press conference and he\u2019d\nbe back when it\u2019s over. I\u2019m meeting him right here.\u201d</p><p>Jon shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s probably safe. He\u2019s your soulmate.

He was both relieved to know\nyou were in the audience and terrified how you would react when you learned\nyour soulmate was a 101-year-old weapon. </p><p>Why did he have to meet you now? Why couldn\u2019t it have been\nsome time when he had all the time in the world to process the fact that he has\na soulmate before having to tell you about his past? He could have talked to\nSteve, gotten to know you a little, and had a better idea of how you would\nreact.</p><p>\u201c\u2026are proud to present to you the newest member of the\nAvengers, Sergeant James Buchanan Barnes, also known as the Winter Soldier!\u201d</p><p>That was his cue. He slipped into what he hoped was a\nneutral expression \u2013 <i>come on, Barnes, you\nshould be better at controlling your emotions than this</i> \u2013 and ascended the\nstage to stand beside Tony and the rest of the team. The press were shouting\nquestions all at once and members of the gathered crowd each had their own\nreactions, but the only face he looked for was yours.</p><p>There you were, in the exact spot where he\u2019d left you,\nstanding next you your friends.

Suddenly the\nstrange things you\u2019d gone through had context. Your incidents were when he was\ninjured on missions, and they were so far apart because he was frozen the rest\nof the time. You may not know all the details of what happened, but you knew\nthe general story; everyone had heard it since Steve Rogers had first brought\nhim back. Heck, half the patrons at the library had asked what you knew about\nthe whole thing. Apparently, you were about to learn a whole lot more.</p><p>The Winter Soldier was your soulmate.</p><p>Jon was babbling about something to your left with Margie\nfrantically trying to shush him, but all you could focus on was the beautiful\nman on stage with his eyes locked on you. Your heart went out to him, seeing\nhim so vulnerable. You wanted to strangle the reporter who asked why Tony\nthought \u201ca brainwashed killer\u201d made a good addition to the team; Natasha\ninstantly became your favorite other team member when she beat everyone else to\nstepping in to defend him.</p><p>How dare anyone try to hurt this beautiful, precious man? He\nhad gone through hell, but you\u2019d looked in his eyes and seen goodness, and\nyou\u2019d fight anyone who accused him of being a monster.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u00a0</p><p>Bucky headed straight for you as soon as the press\nconference was over, ignoring the questions from lingering reporters who\nfortunately weren\u2019t curious enough to want to get close to him. You saw him\ncoming and saw one question in his eyes.</p><p><i>Do you hate me?</i></p><p>You met him halfway and pulled him down into a kiss. He\nimmediately kissed back, his mouth desperate and needy. You weren\u2019t entirely\nsure you were kissing him properly \u2013 you\u2019d been determined to save your first\nkiss for your soulmate, so you had zero practice \u2013 but kissing Bucky felt <i>right</i>. You melted into him and wove your\nfingers through his hair. He wrapped his metal arm, now on display in the\njacket he\u2019d changed into, around your body and pulled you closer, cupping your\njaw with his flesh hand. When you finally had to breathe, you pulled your head\nback but kept yourself tucked against him.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t hate me?\u201d he whispered, the question breaking\nyour heart.</p><p>\u201cHow could I hate the most precious man in the world?\u201d you\nasked.</p><p>His eyes shone wet, but no tears fell.
