A weakness that he can\u2019t afford if he wants to make his father proud.<br/></p><p><i>Stark\nmen are made of iron.</i></p><p>It\u2019s etched\ninto his heart, the incision aching with every beat, and he feels his father\u2019s\nword in his lungs with every breath he takes. Like acid the words dissolve him\nfrom the inside, battling the very core of who he is \u2013 <i>was</i>.</p><p>He\u2019s 15 and\nhe\u2019s by far the youngest student on the MIT campus. </p><p>Everything\nand <i>everyone</i> around him feels so much bigger than he is, than what he\nfeels like, but he\u2019s used to feeling small and worthless so he squares his\nshoulders and he puts on the persona that has gotten him through his one\ndreadful year of high school. He\u2019s smart, he\u2019s sassy and he doesn\u2019t mince his\nwords. He lets everyone know exactly who he is. </p><p>It doesn\u2019t\ntake him more than two weeks to troop together a group of people who <i>love</i>\nhanging out with Howard Stark\u2019s son. (It just happens to be Tony, he knows\nthat.)</p><p>It takes\nhim three parties to get his reputation as a player. (Because sex, he was\ntaught, is the only physical connection that is about control not weakness and\nhe can\u2019t shut down the last pathetic part of him that still craves human contact.)\n</p><!-- more --><p>James Rhodes is not a player. He shows up to some parties, he socializes\neasily and is an all-around all-liked person. He speaks his mind but he does so\nin a polite way, inviting discussion and discourse as long as it\u2019s on-topic und\nrespectful. He doesn\u2019t let frustration and anger cloud his judgement. He\u2019s\nresilient in his work and his intelligence is quiet and steady. </p><p>In short,\nhe\u2019s everything Tony is not and normally their paths would never have crossed. </p><p>Maybe it\u2019s\nfate that decides that they should meet. Maybe it\u2019s just dumb luck. Whatever it\nis, Tony is grateful they do. </p><p>When they do, Tony is running on four hours of sleep\nin just as many days and he\u2019s shaking like a leaf. His hands are trying to\nconnect the last few wires on his robot but they\u2019re too jittery to perform the\ndelicate action and he ends up electrocuting himself. Just for a moment,\nthough, and no one else in the big lab seems to notice so he just keeps going\nlike he always does.</p><p>That is until a heavy hand settles on his\nshoulder, making him flinch so hard he drops both the unfinished robot and his\ntools. Every little fiber in him is screaming alarm. Sudden touches can only\never mean pain and he is too tired to deal with any more of that right now, too\nhollow to put up his mask.</p><p>Somehow he manages to keep himself from yelping\nbut when he turns and his eyes land on the other boy who\u2019s standing way too\nclose for comfort, his fear morphs into anger. (Anger, Howard taught him, demands\nrespect and installs fear in his opponent.)</p><p>\u201cWhat the actual fuck?\u201d he exclaims. What\nstarted as a deep manly curse ends in a high-pitched screech, informing the\nother kid of just how young he actually is. Tony fucking hates puberty. </p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d The other boy backs up immediately,\nbrown eyes open and free of any trace of malice.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t there, just means he\nhides it well, Tony thinks.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to startle you. Just wanted to\nlet you know that they\u2019re closing up the labs in about twenty minutes.\u201d </p><p>Tony nods and he thinks, hopes, that this is\nit. That the other boy just came to tell him that and that he is going to leave\nnow. But these eyes \u2013 they stare right into his soul and it makes him feel\nlacking because he knows what they\u2019ll find, he knows what everyone has always\nfound so far. No one has stayed after all.</p><p>\u201cWhat are\nyou working on?\u201d the older boy asks. He seems truly interested and it\u2019s\nconfusing Tony. No one is ever interested in what he\u2019s doing. Not really\nanyway.</p><p>He frowns.\n\u201cWhat? So you can make fun of me?\u201d And damn it if this doesn\u2019t sound absolutely\npathetic. </p><p>\u201cNo, of\ncourse not.\u201d The boy seems honestly insulted at the accusation. (Good, maybe\nhe\u2019ll leave before he can hurt him.) \u201cIt just looks really cool. Is that a\nrobot?\u201d </p><p>Tony\nshrugs, giving up on trying to get him to leave in favor of trying to finish\nhis work before the lab closes. \u201cHe\u2019s supposed to be one.\u201d For some reason the\nextra set of eyes makes him move more carefully and, without any more\nincidents, he manages to finish connecting all the wires. </p><p>He waits.\nSomething is supposed to happen. Or has he messed this up, too? Is he really\nnot capable of doing anything right at all? </p><p>Suddenly\nthe machine makes a sad <i>beep-boop</i>, moving its claw once, twice, three\ntimes before it short circuits and dies down with a gurgling noise. </p><p>Pathetic. </p><p>And Tony?\nHe\u2019s this close to a mental breakdown and he knows he can\u2019t succumb to it here because\nno one is allowed to see Howard Stark\u2019s son cry. Least of all an older guy from\nMIT, smart and on the lower range of popular, who\u2019s going to tell everyone\nabout how much of a scalawag he is.</p><p><i>Stark\nmen are made of iron.</i></p><p>But Tony\nisn\u2019t. </p><p>His body is\nshaking with sleep-deprivation, too much caffeine and shame when he picks up\nthe useless robot that he has already internally labeled Dum-E. He hoped that\nDum-E would show his father that even dummies like him can be useful sometimes\nbut it seems like his old man was right. Like he always is. Tony truly is good\nfor nothing. </p><p>A dummy who\nbuilds dummies who aren\u2019t good for anything either.</p><p>\u201cThat was\npretty impressive,\u201d the other boy interrupts his inner monologue and Tony fails\nto find the sarcasm in his voice but maybe he just can\u2019t even read people\nanymore, so he glares at him. He doesn\u2019t seem to care about it too much,\nthough, and reaches out to inspect the inner workings of the robot with gentle,\nsteady hands.</p><p>His arm is resting lightly against Tony\u2019s and he doesn\u2019t dare to move,\nmind hyper-focused on the contact. The stranger is warm and soft and real and\nTony\u2019s heart aches suddenly with how much he misses his mother\u2019s hugs. So he\ndoesn\u2019t pull away and tries to shift his focus a little until he can tune into\nwhat\u2019s apparently a conversation now.</p><p>\u201cI think if\nyou took a little time to actually sleep this could end up being really\nuseful,\u201d he tells him with a small smile, \u201cI\u2019m actually working on an\nassignment about the most basic form of artificial intelligence. What do you\nsay? We could put your heads together over lunch tomorrow?\u201d </p><p>Tony is too\nstunned at how <i>nice</i> he is being treated to tell him to go fuck himself\nso he simply nods. The other boy grins, seemingly happy about their date. </p><p>\u201cGreat,\nthen tomorrow at Dan\u2019s Diner around noon? My treat.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou do know\nI\u2019m Tony Stark, right?\u201d He frowns then at the weirdly likeable boy who\u2019s clad\nin a loosely fitting t-shirt that has seen better days and worn shoes that are\ndistinctly lacking any real sole at this point and who\u2019s offering to pay for\nhis meal. </p><p>The boy\ncocks an eyebrow and shrugs. \u201cAnd I\u2019m James,\u201d he tells him matter-of-factly,\n\u201cJames Rhodes, not Bond.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a\nboring name,\u201d he can\u2019t stop himself from saying, cringing inwardly at his own\nbluntness, even as he shakes the extended hand. \u201cThere\u2019s no cool nickname for\nJames. I\u2019ll call you Rhodey.\u201d</p><p>He rolls\nhis eyes but they seem to twinkle at the nickname and his voice is pleasantly\nteasing when he answers. \u201cWhatever you say, Tones.\u201d</p><p>Maybe it\u2019s\nthe sleep-deprivation or the looming of despair at yet another failed project.\nMaybe it\u2019s because that\u2019s the first casual conversation he\u2019s had in weeks and\nhe\u2019s been longing for another person to talk to. Or maybe it\u2019s because for some\ninexplicable reason James Rhodes\u2019 company makes him feel safe. </p><p>But for the\nfirst time since leaving Jarvis and his mother behind he laughs, a deep-belly\nlaugh that shakes his whole body up and that warms his chest with something\nother than dreed. </p><p>They end up\nworking on Dum-E for a little over two weeks and when they\u2019re finally finished\nhe can\u2019t talk but he\u2019s capable of understanding basic voice commands and even\nanswers in <i>beep-boop</i>\u2019s that seem to convey emotions such as sadness,\ncheerfulness and anger. (Or maybe they\u2019re imagining that. They have barely\nslept in days.)</p><p>The best thing\nabout getting his robot to work isn\u2019t the fact that they prove Dum-E to be\nactually useful but the way Rhodey becomes the first person in a long time he\nfeels truly comfortable with. </p><p>Rhodey,\never so perceptive, figures out Tony\u2019s bivalent relationship with touches in a\nmatter of days and he\u2019s always careful not to crowd him, backing off when Tony\nneeds it, but there when a gentle touch is all he needs to not fall apart. </p><p>After\nfinishing Dum-E his new friend leans forward carefully, holding his gaze as if\nasking for permission, before he engulfs him in a tight hug. And Tony realizes,\nas he lets himself rest against the older boy\u2019s chest and relaxes in his\nfriend\u2019s arms that this is one of the most peaceful moments in his life. It\ngives him hope for the future that, for once, has nothing to do with being the\nheir of Stark Industries. </p><p>And he vows\nto himself that he won\u2019t ever give up on Dum-E just like Rhodey, for some\nindiscernible reason, never gave up on him.</p><p>.</p><hr><p>\u201cTony! Stop\nfor a second, please!\u201d </p><p>Her raised\nvoice catches him off guard even though it shouldn\u2019t have. He has seen this\ncoming, has prepared for it. Still, when he lowers the spatula his entire body\nhas gone rigid and it\u2019s all he can do to stare at the sizzling pieces of bacon\nin the pan. The sound feels weirdly out of place in the otherwise quiet room and\nhe can only watch them in crude fascination, certain that in a couple of\nminutes they\u2019d be burned and he\u2019d have to throw them away but not moving to\nchange the setting on the stove. </p><p>It\u2019s like\nwaiting for a train wreck you know is going to happen. It\u2019s an apt description\nof his life, he figures.</p><p>Pepper\u2019s\nvoice is soft again and he feels more than hears her step closer to the kitchen\ncounter he\u2019s hiding behind. He can picture the way her long hair falls over her\nshoulders in artistic waves and he knows that there is a frown on her forehead,\na tiny wrinkle sitting right between her eyebrows. He knows the look in her\neyes, the blue eyes that are deeper than the ocean, similarly infinite and so\nmuch more beautiful. </p><p>\u201cCan you\nturn around for me?\u201d she asks, gently and probing but not demanding. Leave it\nto Pepper, the most demanding woman he has ever met, to be the first to let him\ndecide whether to look at her or not.</p><p>He\u2019s sure\nshe knows how much he hates being yelled at and he can\u2019t help but feel thankful\nfor her thoughtfulness. It makes it a little easier for him to release the\ndeath grip is hand has on the wooden spatula. Olive wood, he thinks\nabsentmindedly, his mother always liked the olive wood spatulas, said they\nreminded her of home.</p><p>His skin is\nstill crawling with barely veiled anxiety but he manages to breathe. In through\nthe nose, out through the mouth. </p><p>He finds\nthe tiny remains of his shattered masks somewhere deep inside him and it\u2019s\nenough to make him shake his head.</p><p>\u201cNope.\nDon\u2019t think I can,\u201d he says, voice light and cheerful and oh-so-fake. \u201cGotta\nwatch that bacon before I burn down the house again, right? You told me\nyourself that that\u2019s not a very responsible thing to do and I \u2013\u201c </p><p>Suddenly\nher hand comes into focus, delicate fingers turning down the stove before\nsettling on the countertop. \u00a0</p><p>Again, her\nvoice is so sweet that it runs down his back like honey. It\u2019s warm and a little\nsad and it makes his anxiety spike. His heart is thumping so loudly in his\nchest, he\u2019s sure she hears it too because she sighs very quietly and then her\nhand is gone from his sight and he thought he would feel better but he doesn\u2019t.\nHe feels worse. As if she\u2019s already gone. </p><p>\u201cPep \u2013\u201c he\nall but whispers because he doesn\u2019t know what else to say, how else to explain\nthe fact that he slipped out of bed and left her all on her own after they\nspent the night together. </p><p>Oh god.\nThey spent the night together. They \u2013 </p><p>When her\nvoice comes back it\u2019s accompanied by a feather-light touch on his wrist. No\nforce, just a question. </p><p>\u201cTony,\u201d she\nstarts and he squeezes his eyes shut because he doesn\u2019t want to hear it, can\u2019t\nstomach listening to it but also can\u2019t stop himself wanting more of that\nangle-like voice. \u201cWhy won\u2019t you look at me?\u201d </p><p>He feels\nher slender fingers run over his palm and toy with his. Hers are warm and soft\nwhere his are cold and calloused. They make a good pair, he thinks, and before\nhe can stop himself he intertwines his fingers with hers and pulls her\nmarginally closer. </p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d\nhe whispers, raising their joined hands to his lips to press a kiss to the back\nof hers, \u201cBecause then you\u2019d see me and you\u2019d find that I\u2019m lacking and I\u2019d\njust rather not do that today.\u201d Or any day, really. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve\nalready seen you,\u201d she answers and he can hear the smile in her voice, would\nlove to see it on her lips but is too scared to move. </p><p>Tony shakes\nhis head but doesn\u2019t release her hand. As if he could make her stay if he just\nheld on tightly enough. \u201cNot like this, you haven\u2019t.\u201d </p><p>He\u2019s not\nsure anyone has ever seen him like this. Hell, he\u2019s not even sure he\u2019s ever\nbeen like this \u2013 all butterflies-in-stomach and sweaty palms. </p><p>It\u2019s love,\nhe thinks. But he\u2019s not sure because he\u2019s never felt it before, doesn\u2019t know\nhow it\u2019s supposed to feel like and if people like him even get to experience\nsomething so sacred. If he had to describe it, though, he\u2019d say he\u2019s in love.\nIt\u2019s the scariest thing he has ever felt in his life. </p><p>It\u2019s\nscarier than terrorists in a cave, scarier than falling to his death and\nscarier, even, than his old man\u2019s raised voice and the smell of whiskey hanging\nin the air. </p><p>\u201cYes, I\nhave,\u201d she replies easily, in the no-nonsense voice that only Pepper Potts can\never really pull off, and tugs on his hand. \u201cLook at me, please. I promise I\nwon\u2019t run.\u201d </p><p>Those were\nthe exact words he has wanted to hear, still he can\u2019t help but question their\nsincerity. After all, who did stick around after seeing him? Only Rhodey so\nfar. And Pepper but \u2013</p><p>He turns\naround and meets her eyes and she just holds his gaze.</p><p>The first\nthing he notices is the sleepy sand in the corner of her eyes. Dried rheum \u2013 a\ncombination of mucin, dust, blood cells and skin cells \u2013 entirely gross if it would\nbe anyone else but this is <i>Pepper</i> and he marvels at the sight. </p><p>She has\nnever been this raw in his company and he wants to cherish it and tell her how\nbeautiful she looks without make-up on. He wants to tell her about the sun\nlight reflecting in her eyes and how her freckles are like a treasure map. He\ndoesn\u2019t say any of that, though. </p><p>They just\nlook at each other. </p><p>It\u2019s Pepper\nwho moves first. (Of course she is. That woman is fearless and he\u2019s a mess.) </p><p>Very gently\nshe pulls her hand out of his grasp and takes a step closer before he can complain\nabout the loss of warmth. She raises her hands, telegraphing every movement as\nif she knows that he flinches when someone raises their hand too suddenly (she\nprobably does), and settles them on his cheeks. </p><p>He leans\ninto the comfort she\u2019s providing with her thumbs rubbing circles into his skin.\nHe lets himself relish in the warmth her touch is offering and his free hand\nsettles on her hip, just a few centimeters over the hem of his shirt that she\u2019s\nwearing. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a\nmess,\u201d he tells her, eyes closed and she is so close he feels her body vibrate\nwith soft chuckles and her hot breath is tickling his chin. </p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d\nshe answers and without having to look he knows that she\u2019s grinning up at him\nin a way that makes the dimples on her cheek stand out. \u201cBut I\u2019ve known that\nbefore.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going\nto mess up. I\u2019m not good at \u2013 this.\u201d He\u2019s not sure why he is trying to make her\nturn away but he knows that he has to be open if this can have any chance of\nworking out. God, he wants it to work out so badly. </p><p>Her reply\nis instant and makes his eyes fly open. \u201cWell, then you apologize and work on\nmaking it better the next time around. You\u2019ll improve. We both will. It\u2019s what\npeople do in a relationship.\u201d </p><p>Again she\nmeets his gaze warmly and without hesitation, a smile curving her lips upwards\njust the tiniest bit. </p><p>It\u2019s in\nthat moment that his love for her overwhelms him. It comes crashing down like a\nwave of adoration and appreciation and devotion and for a second he\u2019s stumbling\nuntil he regains his balance and matches her smile with his. </p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t\nknow what people do in a relationship, Ms. Potts.\u201d He grins down at her\ncheekily and a weight falls off his chest when she starts laughing loudly. </p><p>\u201cBelieve\nme, I know,\u201d she smirks and leans up to press a lingering kiss to his lips,\n\u201cBut I think I\u2019m up to the challenge, Mr. Stark.\u201d </p><p>Her hands\nare still resting on his face and it feels like they have always been there, as\nif this is supposed to be. As if they were meant to be.</p><p>It takes\nthem a lot of effort and ups and downs but Pepper\u2019s touch slowly glues all his\nbroken pieces back together, blowing kisses to the faint scars that remain.</p><p>.\u00a0\u00a0</p><hr><p>When he\nhears the blood rushing in his ears and feels his heart beat violently in his\nchest out of nowhere, he stops mid-movement. Screwdriver in hand with his body\nbent over the wiring of the suit he\u2019s working on he tries to take a deep breath\njust to see if he can. </p><p>It works\nsurprisingly well but the sensation of his body shaking with every beat of his\nheart - like it\u2019s a wrecking ball not a pump - is still there and while it\u2019s\nnothing entirely new he really doesn\u2019t enjoy the feeling of his ribcage\nthreatening to tear open with every <i>thump</i> of the vital organ. </p><p>Quietly he\nsets down the tool and moves his right hand to rest over his sternum, right\nabove the scar where his arc reactor used to sit. The feeling of skin on skin\nand the light pressure he puts on his thorax help ground him only marginally\nand his stupid heartrate is hell bent on accelerating no matter how evenly he\nbreathes which is just annoying. </p><p>His left\nhand comes up, fingers routinely grabbing his radial pulse point as he tries to\nwill his heart to slow down. The moves have become instinctually over the\nyears. Having had shrapnel mere millimeters from one of the few things he quite\nliterally can\u2019t live without has made him hyperaware of everything that might\nbe going wonky in his chest. </p><p>It\u2019s that\nhyper-fixation that makes even the smallest palpitation seem like a coronary,\ncomplete with mortal agony and phantom pain spreading into his left arm until\nhis pinky starts cramping. \u00a0 </p><p><i>Three\ncounts in, five counts out. </i></p><p>He coaches\nhimself to breathe evenly. The chances of this actually being a heart attack\nare slim to none. His doctor had him checked out just three days ago.<i> </i>As\nthe doc would say: his fear is understandable but unnecessary. It\u2019s fine. Just\na random spike of anxiety that doesn\u2019t mean anything.</p><p><i>Three in.\nFive out. </i></p><p><i>One,\nTwo, Three. </i></p><p><i>One,\nTwo, Three, Four, Five. </i></p><p><i>Again.</i></p><p>\u201cMister Stark? Are you okay?\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 </p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d he\nopens his eyes all at once to see Peter standing next to his work station, a\ntube of something in his hand, worrying at his bottom lip as he watches Tony\ncling to his own chest. </p><p>Upon seeing\nthe big brown eyes that peep out under the messy shock of curls he feels warmth\nspread through his chest like a wildfire. It\u2019s almost unpleasantly fast but it\nleaves a field of peace in its wake which is doing more in calming his racing\nheart than any breathing exercise he\u2019s tried so far. There\u2019s something\nundeniably powerful about this kid\u2019s presence to ground him to reality. </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he\nsays and when the words leave his mouth they\u2019re barely a lie anymore but they have\na pact where they don\u2019t lie at all, so he tags on, \u201cJust my heart running riot\nfor no apparent reason. Don\u2019t worry about it. What were you working on? Is that\nChemistry project going well? Do you need help?\u201d </p><p>As has\nbecome the norm in moments like these, Peter completely ignores his attempts to\nchange the topic and cocks his head to the side in a mix of worry, amusement\nand plain adoration as he gingerly takes a seat on the swivel chair next to his\nmentor. </p><p>God. His\nlove for this kid is making his heart clench painfully. He\u2019s never really\nexperienced this kind of unconditional love before and some days it feels like\nhis body hasn\u2019t been made with emotions like that in mind. They\u2019re burning too\nhot when he\u2019s freezing, leaving him reeling and unsure of where to turn.</p><p>\u201cDid you\ntake your meds?\u201d He turns on the chair until his left thigh is resting against\nTony\u2019s right knee and the petite touch is incredibly welcome, almost\ndisturbingly calming. </p><p>He makes a\nface because he doesn\u2019t like talking about his mental health and everything\nthat\u2019s wrong with it but he relents with a soft sigh and a shake of his head.\n\u201cNope. Doc said we could taper off them as long as I keep seeing her and\nnothing new comes up. But it\u2019s fine, Pete. I promise. Just not all that comfortable,\nthat\u2019s it.\u201d </p><p>When Peter\nonly pouts but doesn\u2019t argue any further, he eases his hands down from his own chest\nand rests them on the kid\u2019s shoulders instead, preening inwardly when the boy\nmeets his gaze openly without further prodding. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not\ngoing to die in the next couple hours. I promise.\u201d </p><p>The\nteenager relaxes then, huffing and leaning forward to rest his forehead on his\nmentor\u2019s shoulder and like clockwork calloused fingers find the tense spots on\nhis neck and start kneading it gently. \u201cI just \u2013 worry. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTell you\nwhat,\u201d Tony grins, standing up and pulling the kid with him, \u201cLet\u2019s call it a\nday down here and catch a movie until Pep gets home for dinner, whataya say?\u201d </p><p>\u201cCan we\njust listen to music?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure we\ncan, bud.\u201d </p><p>They end up\nlistening to one of the few recorded pieces of Guido Agosti, an Italian pianist\nthat taught his mom to play when she was young and it brings him back to a time\nwhen touch was not yet forbidden. A time when Maria Stark would sing him to\nsleep and he stayed up well past his bed-time only to listen to her play. </p><p>Sometimes\nthey would listen to recordings together, from her priced possession of vinyl\nand those are some of the few moments of his childhood that he still revisits\nfrequently and joyfully albeit with a heavy heart. </p><p>It\u2019s not\nthat all that different now. </p><p>Peter\u2019s ear\nis resting right above his heart, his breathing coming out in soft even puffs\nof warm air against Tony\u2019s collarbone. He\u2019s curled up into him, fitting into\nTony\u2019s embrace like he was meant to end up here. Like this has been life\u2019s\ngrand goal all along and if that\u2019s true then Tony can\u2019t even be mad at\neverything that\u2019s happened so far. </p><p>His fingers\nrun through the mess of curls ever so gently, working on the numerous knots with\na proficiency that has come with hours and hours of practice. </p><p>The kid\u2019s\nalready starting to nod off to the quiet calming sounds of his mother\u2019s\nchildhood hero and he pulls him impossibly closer, index and middle finger\ncoming to rest over the soft thump of his temporal pulse point. </p><p>Peter\nParker came into his life when he was lost, only held together by Rhodey and\nPepper but always dangerously close to falling apart. He thought there was no\nmore room in his heart. That there was no way someone could get past the\nbarriers he\u2019s built over the years and, honestly, he didn\u2019t think there was any\nneed to. </p><p>Somehow,\nand without meaning to, Peter has barreled past all of them and quietly but\nfirmly made room between all the scars and the betrayal and the fear. He settled\ndown between all the pieces, build himself a shelter and, simultaneously,\nfilled an aching hole in Tony\u2019s chest that he hadn\u2019t even realized was there. </p><p>Tony leans\nover to pull a blanket on top of both of them, smiling into Peter\u2019s hair when\nhe nestles closer and lets out a soft snore. Before he drifts off to sleep,\nheart beating strong and steady and normally in his chest, he presses a kiss to\nhis temple. </p><p>\u201cI love\nyou, Petey. Never change. Not like I did.\u201d</p>",

He shows up to some parties, he socializes\neasily and is an all-around all-liked person. He speaks his mind but he does so\nin a polite way, inviting discussion and discourse as long as it\u2019s on-topic und\nrespectful. He doesn\u2019t let frustration and anger cloud his judgement. He\u2019s\nresilient in his work and his intelligence is quiet and steady. </p><p>In short,\nhe\u2019s everything Tony is not and normally their paths would never have crossed. </p><p>Maybe it\u2019s\nfate that decides that they should meet. Maybe it\u2019s just dumb luck. Whatever it\nis, Tony is grateful they do. </p><p>When they do, Tony is running on four hours of sleep\nin just as many days and he\u2019s shaking like a leaf. His hands are trying to\nconnect the last few wires on his robot but they\u2019re too jittery to perform the\ndelicate action and he ends up electrocuting himself. Just for a moment,\nthough, and no one else in the big lab seems to notice so he just keeps going\nlike he always does.</p><p>That is until a heavy hand settles on his\nshoulder, making him flinch so hard he drops both the unfinished robot and his\ntools. Every little fiber in him is screaming alarm. Sudden touches can only\never mean pain and he is too tired to deal with any more of that right now, too\nhollow to put up his mask.</p><p>Somehow he manages to keep himself from yelping\nbut when he turns and his eyes land on the other boy who\u2019s standing way too\nclose for comfort, his fear morphs into anger. (Anger, Howard taught him, demands\nrespect and installs fear in his opponent.)</p><p>\u201cWhat the actual fuck?\u201d he exclaims. What\nstarted as a deep manly curse ends in a high-pitched screech, informing the\nother kid of just how young he actually is. Tony fucking hates puberty. </p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d The other boy backs up immediately,\nbrown eyes open and free of any trace of malice.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t there, just means he\nhides it well, Tony thinks.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to startle you. Just wanted to\nlet you know that they\u2019re closing up the labs in about twenty minutes.\u201d </p><p>Tony nods and he thinks, hopes, that this is\nit. That the other boy just came to tell him that and that he is going to leave\nnow. But these eyes \u2013 they stare right into his soul and it makes him feel\nlacking because he knows what they\u2019ll find, he knows what everyone has always\nfound so far. No one has stayed after all.</p><p>\u201cWhat are\nyou working on?\u201d the older boy asks. He seems truly interested and it\u2019s\nconfusing Tony. No one is ever interested in what he\u2019s doing. Not really\nanyway.</p><p>He frowns.\n\u201cWhat? So you can make fun of me?\u201d And damn it if this doesn\u2019t sound absolutely\npathetic. </p><p>\u201cNo, of\ncourse not.\u201d The boy seems honestly insulted at the accusation. (Good, maybe\nhe\u2019ll leave before he can hurt him.) \u201cIt just looks really cool. Is that a\nrobot?\u201d </p><p>Tony\nshrugs, giving up on trying to get him to leave in favor of trying to finish\nhis work before the lab closes. \u201cHe\u2019s supposed to be one.\u201d For some reason the\nextra set of eyes makes him move more carefully and, without any more\nincidents, he manages to finish connecting all the wires. </p><p>He waits.\nSomething is supposed to happen. Or has he messed this up, too? Is he really\nnot capable of doing anything right at all? </p><p>Suddenly\nthe machine makes a sad <i>beep-boop</i>, moving its claw once, twice, three\ntimes before it short circuits and dies down with a gurgling noise. </p><p>Pathetic. </p><p>And Tony?\nHe\u2019s this close to a mental breakdown and he knows he can\u2019t succumb to it here because\nno one is allowed to see Howard Stark\u2019s son cry. Least of all an older guy from\nMIT, smart and on the lower range of popular, who\u2019s going to tell everyone\nabout how much of a scalawag he is.</p><p><i>Stark\nmen are made of iron.</i></p><p>But Tony\nisn\u2019t. </p><p>His body is\nshaking with sleep-deprivation, too much caffeine and shame when he picks up\nthe useless robot that he has already internally labeled Dum-E. He hoped that\nDum-E would show his father that even dummies like him can be useful sometimes\nbut it seems like his old man was right. Like he always is. Tony truly is good\nfor nothing. </p><p>A dummy who\nbuilds dummies who aren\u2019t good for anything either.</p><p>\u201cThat was\npretty impressive,\u201d the other boy interrupts his inner monologue and Tony fails\nto find the sarcasm in his voice but maybe he just can\u2019t even read people\nanymore, so he glares at him. He doesn\u2019t seem to care about it too much,\nthough, and reaches out to inspect the inner workings of the robot with gentle,\nsteady hands.</p><p>His arm is resting lightly against Tony\u2019s and he doesn\u2019t dare to move,\nmind hyper-focused on the contact. The stranger is warm and soft and real and\nTony\u2019s heart aches suddenly with how much he misses his mother\u2019s hugs. So he\ndoesn\u2019t pull away and tries to shift his focus a little until he can tune into\nwhat\u2019s apparently a conversation now.</p><p>\u201cI think if\nyou took a little time to actually sleep this could end up being really\nuseful,\u201d he tells him with a small smile, \u201cI\u2019m actually working on an\nassignment about the most basic form of artificial intelligence. What do you\nsay? We could put your heads together over lunch tomorrow?\u201d </p><p>Tony is too\nstunned at how <i>nice</i> he is being treated to tell him to go fuck himself\nso he simply nods. The other boy grins, seemingly happy about their date. </p><p>\u201cGreat,\nthen tomorrow at Dan\u2019s Diner around noon? My treat.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou do know\nI\u2019m Tony Stark, right?\u201d He frowns then at the weirdly likeable boy who\u2019s clad\nin a loosely fitting t-shirt that has seen better days and worn shoes that are\ndistinctly lacking any real sole at this point and who\u2019s offering to pay for\nhis meal. </p><p>The boy\ncocks an eyebrow and shrugs. \u201cAnd I\u2019m James,\u201d he tells him matter-of-factly,\n\u201cJames Rhodes, not Bond.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a\nboring name,\u201d he can\u2019t stop himself from saying, cringing inwardly at his own\nbluntness, even as he shakes the extended hand. \u201cThere\u2019s no cool nickname for\nJames. I\u2019ll call you Rhodey.\u201d</p><p>He rolls\nhis eyes but they seem to twinkle at the nickname and his voice is pleasantly\nteasing when he answers. \u201cWhatever you say, Tones.\u201d</p><p>Maybe it\u2019s\nthe sleep-deprivation or the looming of despair at yet another failed project.\nMaybe it\u2019s because that\u2019s the first casual conversation he\u2019s had in weeks and\nhe\u2019s been longing for another person to talk to. Or maybe it\u2019s because for some\ninexplicable reason James Rhodes\u2019 company makes him feel safe. </p><p>But for the\nfirst time since leaving Jarvis and his mother behind he laughs, a deep-belly\nlaugh that shakes his whole body up and that warms his chest with something\nother than dreed. </p><p>They end up\nworking on Dum-E for a little over two weeks and when they\u2019re finally finished\nhe can\u2019t talk but he\u2019s capable of understanding basic voice commands and even\nanswers in <i>beep-boop</i>\u2019s that seem to convey emotions such as sadness,\ncheerfulness and anger. (Or maybe they\u2019re imagining that. They have barely\nslept in days.)</p><p>The best thing\nabout getting his robot to work isn\u2019t the fact that they prove Dum-E to be\nactually useful but the way Rhodey becomes the first person in a long time he\nfeels truly comfortable with. </p><p>Rhodey,\never so perceptive, figures out Tony\u2019s bivalent relationship with touches in a\nmatter of days and he\u2019s always careful not to crowd him, backing off when Tony\nneeds it, but there when a gentle touch is all he needs to not fall apart. </p><p>After\nfinishing Dum-E his new friend leans forward carefully, holding his gaze as if\nasking for permission, before he engulfs him in a tight hug. And Tony realizes,\nas he lets himself rest against the older boy\u2019s chest and relaxes in his\nfriend\u2019s arms that this is one of the most peaceful moments in his life. It\ngives him hope for the future that, for once, has nothing to do with being the\nheir of Stark Industries. </p><p>And he vows\nto himself that he won\u2019t ever give up on Dum-E just like Rhodey, for some\nindiscernible reason, never gave up on him.</p><p>.</p><hr><p>\u201cTony! Stop\nfor a second, please!\u201d </p><p>Her raised\nvoice catches him off guard even though it shouldn\u2019t have. He has seen this\ncoming, has prepared for it. Still, when he lowers the spatula his entire body\nhas gone rigid and it\u2019s all he can do to stare at the sizzling pieces of bacon\nin the pan. The sound feels weirdly out of place in the otherwise quiet room and\nhe can only watch them in crude fascination, certain that in a couple of\nminutes they\u2019d be burned and he\u2019d have to throw them away but not moving to\nchange the setting on the stove. </p><p>It\u2019s like\nwaiting for a train wreck you know is going to happen. It\u2019s an apt description\nof his life, he figures.</p><p>Pepper\u2019s\nvoice is soft again and he feels more than hears her step closer to the kitchen\ncounter he\u2019s hiding behind. He can picture the way her long hair falls over her\nshoulders in artistic waves and he knows that there is a frown on her forehead,\na tiny wrinkle sitting right between her eyebrows. He knows the look in her\neyes, the blue eyes that are deeper than the ocean, similarly infinite and so\nmuch more beautiful. </p><p>\u201cCan you\nturn around for me?\u201d she asks, gently and probing but not demanding. Leave it\nto Pepper, the most demanding woman he has ever met, to be the first to let him\ndecide whether to look at her or not.</p><p>He\u2019s sure\nshe knows how much he hates being yelled at and he can\u2019t help but feel thankful\nfor her thoughtfulness. It makes it a little easier for him to release the\ndeath grip is hand has on the wooden spatula. Olive wood, he thinks\nabsentmindedly, his mother always liked the olive wood spatulas, said they\nreminded her of home.</p><p>His skin is\nstill crawling with barely veiled anxiety but he manages to breathe. In through\nthe nose, out through the mouth. </p><p>He finds\nthe tiny remains of his shattered masks somewhere deep inside him and it\u2019s\nenough to make him shake his head.</p><p>\u201cNope.\nDon\u2019t think I can,\u201d he says, voice light and cheerful and oh-so-fake. \u201cGotta\nwatch that bacon before I burn down the house again, right? You told me\nyourself that that\u2019s not a very responsible thing to do and I \u2013\u201c </p><p>Suddenly\nher hand comes into focus, delicate fingers turning down the stove before\nsettling on the countertop. \u00a0</p><p>Again, her\nvoice is so sweet that it runs down his back like honey. It\u2019s warm and a little\nsad and it makes his anxiety spike. His heart is thumping so loudly in his\nchest, he\u2019s sure she hears it too because she sighs very quietly and then her\nhand is gone from his sight and he thought he would feel better but he doesn\u2019t.\nHe feels worse. As if she\u2019s already gone. </p><p>\u201cPep \u2013\u201c he\nall but whispers because he doesn\u2019t know what else to say, how else to explain\nthe fact that he slipped out of bed and left her all on her own after they\nspent the night together. </p><p>Oh god.\nThey spent the night together. They \u2013 </p><p>When her\nvoice comes back it\u2019s accompanied by a feather-light touch on his wrist. No\nforce, just a question. </p><p>\u201cTony,\u201d she\nstarts and he squeezes his eyes shut because he doesn\u2019t want to hear it, can\u2019t\nstomach listening to it but also can\u2019t stop himself wanting more of that\nangle-like voice. \u201cWhy won\u2019t you look at me?\u201d </p><p>He feels\nher slender fingers run over his palm and toy with his. Hers are warm and soft\nwhere his are cold and calloused. They make a good pair, he thinks, and before\nhe can stop himself he intertwines his fingers with hers and pulls her\nmarginally closer. </p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d\nhe whispers, raising their joined hands to his lips to press a kiss to the back\nof hers, \u201cBecause then you\u2019d see me and you\u2019d find that I\u2019m lacking and I\u2019d\njust rather not do that today.\u201d Or any day, really. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve\nalready seen you,\u201d she answers and he can hear the smile in her voice, would\nlove to see it on her lips but is too scared to move. </p><p>Tony shakes\nhis head but doesn\u2019t release her hand. As if he could make her stay if he just\nheld on tightly enough. \u201cNot like this, you haven\u2019t.\u201d </p><p>He\u2019s not\nsure anyone has ever seen him like this. Hell, he\u2019s not even sure he\u2019s ever\nbeen like this \u2013 all butterflies-in-stomach and sweaty palms. </p><p>It\u2019s love,\nhe thinks. But he\u2019s not sure because he\u2019s never felt it before, doesn\u2019t know\nhow it\u2019s supposed to feel like and if people like him even get to experience\nsomething so sacred. If he had to describe it, though, he\u2019d say he\u2019s in love.\nIt\u2019s the scariest thing he has ever felt in his life. </p><p>It\u2019s\nscarier than terrorists in a cave, scarier than falling to his death and\nscarier, even, than his old man\u2019s raised voice and the smell of whiskey hanging\nin the air. </p><p>\u201cYes, I\nhave,\u201d she replies easily, in the no-nonsense voice that only Pepper Potts can\never really pull off, and tugs on his hand. \u201cLook at me, please. I promise I\nwon\u2019t run.\u201d </p><p>Those were\nthe exact words he has wanted to hear, still he can\u2019t help but question their\nsincerity. After all, who did stick around after seeing him? Only Rhodey so\nfar. And Pepper but \u2013</p><p>He turns\naround and meets her eyes and she just holds his gaze.</p><p>The first\nthing he notices is the sleepy sand in the corner of her eyes. Dried rheum \u2013 a\ncombination of mucin, dust, blood cells and skin cells \u2013 entirely gross if it would\nbe anyone else but this is <i>Pepper</i> and he marvels at the sight. </p><p>She has\nnever been this raw in his company and he wants to cherish it and tell her how\nbeautiful she looks without make-up on. He wants to tell her about the sun\nlight reflecting in her eyes and how her freckles are like a treasure map. He\ndoesn\u2019t say any of that, though. </p><p>They just\nlook at each other. </p><p>It\u2019s Pepper\nwho moves first. (Of course she is. That woman is fearless and he\u2019s a mess.) </p><p>Very gently\nshe pulls her hand out of his grasp and takes a step closer before he can complain\nabout the loss of warmth. She raises her hands, telegraphing every movement as\nif she knows that he flinches when someone raises their hand too suddenly (she\nprobably does), and settles them on his cheeks. </p><p>He leans\ninto the comfort she\u2019s providing with her thumbs rubbing circles into his skin.\nHe lets himself relish in the warmth her touch is offering and his free hand\nsettles on her hip, just a few centimeters over the hem of his shirt that she\u2019s\nwearing. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a\nmess,\u201d he tells her, eyes closed and she is so close he feels her body vibrate\nwith soft chuckles and her hot breath is tickling his chin. </p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d\nshe answers and without having to look he knows that she\u2019s grinning up at him\nin a way that makes the dimples on her cheek stand out. \u201cBut I\u2019ve known that\nbefore.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going\nto mess up. I\u2019m not good at \u2013 this.\u201d He\u2019s not sure why he is trying to make her\nturn away but he knows that he has to be open if this can have any chance of\nworking out. God, he wants it to work out so badly. </p><p>Her reply\nis instant and makes his eyes fly open. \u201cWell, then you apologize and work on\nmaking it better the next time around. You\u2019ll improve. We both will. It\u2019s what\npeople do in a relationship.\u201d </p><p>Again she\nmeets his gaze warmly and without hesitation, a smile curving her lips upwards\njust the tiniest bit. </p><p>It\u2019s in\nthat moment that his love for her overwhelms him. It comes crashing down like a\nwave of adoration and appreciation and devotion and for a second he\u2019s stumbling\nuntil he regains his balance and matches her smile with his. </p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t\nknow what people do in a relationship, Ms. Potts.\u201d He grins down at her\ncheekily and a weight falls off his chest when she starts laughing loudly. </p><p>\u201cBelieve\nme, I know,\u201d she smirks and leans up to press a lingering kiss to his lips,\n\u201cBut I think I\u2019m up to the challenge, Mr. Stark.\u201d </p><p>Her hands\nare still resting on his face and it feels like they have always been there, as\nif this is supposed to be. As if they were meant to be.</p><p>It takes\nthem a lot of effort and ups and downs but Pepper\u2019s touch slowly glues all his\nbroken pieces back together, blowing kisses to the faint scars that remain.</p><p>.\u00a0\u00a0</p><hr><p>When he\nhears the blood rushing in his ears and feels his heart beat violently in his\nchest out of nowhere, he stops mid-movement. Screwdriver in hand with his body\nbent over the wiring of the suit he\u2019s working on he tries to take a deep breath\njust to see if he can. </p><p>It works\nsurprisingly well but the sensation of his body shaking with every beat of his\nheart - like it\u2019s a wrecking ball not a pump - is still there and while it\u2019s\nnothing entirely new he really doesn\u2019t enjoy the feeling of his ribcage\nthreatening to tear open with every <i>thump</i> of the vital organ. </p><p>Quietly he\nsets down the tool and moves his right hand to rest over his sternum, right\nabove the scar where his arc reactor used to sit. The feeling of skin on skin\nand the light pressure he puts on his thorax help ground him only marginally\nand his stupid heartrate is hell bent on accelerating no matter how evenly he\nbreathes which is just annoying. </p><p>His left\nhand comes up, fingers routinely grabbing his radial pulse point as he tries to\nwill his heart to slow down. The moves have become instinctually over the\nyears. Having had shrapnel mere millimeters from one of the few things he quite\nliterally can\u2019t live without has made him hyperaware of everything that might\nbe going wonky in his chest. </p><p>It\u2019s that\nhyper-fixation that makes even the smallest palpitation seem like a coronary,\ncomplete with mortal agony and phantom pain spreading into his left arm until\nhis pinky starts cramping. \u00a0 </p><p><i>Three\ncounts in, five counts out. </i></p><p>He coaches\nhimself to breathe evenly. The chances of this actually being a heart attack\nare slim to none. His doctor had him checked out just three days ago.<i> </i>As\nthe doc would say: his fear is understandable but unnecessary. It\u2019s fine. Just\na random spike of anxiety that doesn\u2019t mean anything.</p><p><i>Three in.\nFive out. </i></p><p><i>One,\nTwo, Three. </i></p><p><i>One,\nTwo, Three, Four, Five. </i></p><p><i>Again.</i></p><p>\u201cMister Stark? Are you okay?\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 </p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d he\nopens his eyes all at once to see Peter standing next to his work station, a\ntube of something in his hand, worrying at his bottom lip as he watches Tony\ncling to his own chest. </p><p>Upon seeing\nthe big brown eyes that peep out under the messy shock of curls he feels warmth\nspread through his chest like a wildfire. It\u2019s almost unpleasantly fast but it\nleaves a field of peace in its wake which is doing more in calming his racing\nheart than any breathing exercise he\u2019s tried so far. There\u2019s something\nundeniably powerful about this kid\u2019s presence to ground him to reality. </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he\nsays and when the words leave his mouth they\u2019re barely a lie anymore but they have\na pact where they don\u2019t lie at all, so he tags on, \u201cJust my heart running riot\nfor no apparent reason. Don\u2019t worry about it. What were you working on? Is that\nChemistry project going well? Do you need help?\u201d </p><p>As has\nbecome the norm in moments like these, Peter completely ignores his attempts to\nchange the topic and cocks his head to the side in a mix of worry, amusement\nand plain adoration as he gingerly takes a seat on the swivel chair next to his\nmentor. </p><p>God. His\nlove for this kid is making his heart clench painfully. He\u2019s never really\nexperienced this kind of unconditional love before and some days it feels like\nhis body hasn\u2019t been made with emotions like that in mind. They\u2019re burning too\nhot when he\u2019s freezing, leaving him reeling and unsure of where to turn.</p><p>\u201cDid you\ntake your meds?\u201d He turns on the chair until his left thigh is resting against\nTony\u2019s right knee and the petite touch is incredibly welcome, almost\ndisturbingly calming. </p><p>He makes a\nface because he doesn\u2019t like talking about his mental health and everything\nthat\u2019s wrong with it but he relents with a soft sigh and a shake of his head.\n\u201cNope. Doc said we could taper off them as long as I keep seeing her and\nnothing new comes up. But it\u2019s fine, Pete. I promise. Just not all that comfortable,\nthat\u2019s it.\u201d </p><p>When Peter\nonly pouts but doesn\u2019t argue any further, he eases his hands down from his own chest\nand rests them on the kid\u2019s shoulders instead, preening inwardly when the boy\nmeets his gaze openly without further prodding. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not\ngoing to die in the next couple hours. I promise.\u201d </p><p>The\nteenager relaxes then, huffing and leaning forward to rest his forehead on his\nmentor\u2019s shoulder and like clockwork calloused fingers find the tense spots on\nhis neck and start kneading it gently. \u201cI just \u2013 worry. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTell you\nwhat,\u201d Tony grins, standing up and pulling the kid with him, \u201cLet\u2019s call it a\nday down here and catch a movie until Pep gets home for dinner, whataya say?\u201d </p><p>\u201cCan we\njust listen to music?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure we\ncan, bud.\u201d </p><p>They end up\nlistening to one of the few recorded pieces of Guido Agosti, an Italian pianist\nthat taught his mom to play when she was young and it brings him back to a time\nwhen touch was not yet forbidden. A time when Maria Stark would sing him to\nsleep and he stayed up well past his bed-time only to listen to her play. </p><p>Sometimes\nthey would listen to recordings together, from her priced possession of vinyl\nand those are some of the few moments of his childhood that he still revisits\nfrequently and joyfully albeit with a heavy heart. </p><p>It\u2019s not\nthat all that different now. </p><p>Peter\u2019s ear\nis resting right above his heart, his breathing coming out in soft even puffs\nof warm air against Tony\u2019s collarbone. He\u2019s curled up into him, fitting into\nTony\u2019s embrace like he was meant to end up here. Like this has been life\u2019s\ngrand goal all along and if that\u2019s true then Tony can\u2019t even be mad at\neverything that\u2019s happened so far. </p><p>His fingers\nrun through the mess of curls ever so gently, working on the numerous knots with\na proficiency that has come with hours and hours of practice. </p><p>The kid\u2019s\nalready starting to nod off to the quiet calming sounds of his mother\u2019s\nchildhood hero and he pulls him impossibly closer, index and middle finger\ncoming to rest over the soft thump of his temporal pulse point. </p><p>Peter\nParker came into his life when he was lost, only held together by Rhodey and\nPepper but always dangerously close to falling apart. He thought there was no\nmore room in his heart. That there was no way someone could get past the\nbarriers he\u2019s built over the years and, honestly, he didn\u2019t think there was any\nneed to. </p><p>Somehow,\nand without meaning to, Peter has barreled past all of them and quietly but\nfirmly made room between all the scars and the betrayal and the fear. He settled\ndown between all the pieces, build himself a shelter and, simultaneously,\nfilled an aching hole in Tony\u2019s chest that he hadn\u2019t even realized was there. </p><p>Tony leans\nover to pull a blanket on top of both of them, smiling into Peter\u2019s hair when\nhe nestles closer and lets out a soft snore. Before he drifts off to sleep,\nheart beating strong and steady and normally in his chest, he presses a kiss to\nhis temple. </p><p>\u201cI love\nyou, Petey. Never change. Not like I did.\u201d</p>",

A weakness that he can\u2019t afford if he wants to make his father proud.<br></p><p><i>Stark\nmen are made of iron.</i></p><p>It\u2019s etched\ninto his heart, the incision aching with every beat, and he feels his father\u2019s\nword in his lungs with every breath he takes. Like acid the words dissolve him\nfrom the inside, battling the very core of who he is \u2013 <i>was</i>.</p><p>He\u2019s 15 and\nhe\u2019s by far the youngest student on the MIT campus. </p><p>Everything\nand <i>everyone</i> around him feels so much bigger than he is, than what he\nfeels like, but he\u2019s used to feeling small and worthless so he squares his\nshoulders and he puts on the persona that has gotten him through his one\ndreadful year of high school. He\u2019s smart, he\u2019s sassy and he doesn\u2019t mince his\nwords. He lets everyone know exactly who he is. </p><p>It doesn\u2019t\ntake him more than two weeks to troop together a group of people who <i>love</i>\nhanging out with Howard Stark\u2019s son. (It just happens to be Tony, he knows\nthat.)</p><p>It takes\nhim three parties to get his reputation as a player. (Because sex, he was\ntaught, is the only physical connection that is about control not weakness and\nhe can\u2019t shut down the last pathetic part of him that still craves human contact.)\n</p>[[MORE]]<p>James Rhodes is not a player. He shows up to some parties, he socializes\neasily and is an all-around all-liked person. He speaks his mind but he does so\nin a polite way, inviting discussion and discourse as long as it\u2019s on-topic und\nrespectful. He doesn\u2019t let frustration and anger cloud his judgement. He\u2019s\nresilient in his work and his intelligence is quiet and steady. </p><p>In short,\nhe\u2019s everything Tony is not and normally their paths would never have crossed. </p><p>Maybe it\u2019s\nfate that decides that they should meet. Maybe it\u2019s just dumb luck. Whatever it\nis, Tony is grateful they do. </p><p>When they do, Tony is running on four hours of sleep\nin just as many days and he\u2019s shaking like a leaf. His hands are trying to\nconnect the last few wires on his robot but they\u2019re too jittery to perform the\ndelicate action and he ends up electrocuting himself. Just for a moment,\nthough, and no one else in the big lab seems to notice so he just keeps going\nlike he always does.</p><p>That is until a heavy hand settles on his\nshoulder, making him flinch so hard he drops both the unfinished robot and his\ntools. Every little fiber in him is screaming alarm. Sudden touches can only\never mean pain and he is too tired to deal with any more of that right now, too\nhollow to put up his mask.</p><p>Somehow he manages to keep himself from yelping\nbut when he turns and his eyes land on the other boy who\u2019s standing way too\nclose for comfort, his fear morphs into anger. (Anger, Howard taught him, demands\nrespect and installs fear in his opponent.)</p><p>\u201cWhat the actual fuck?\u201d he exclaims. What\nstarted as a deep manly curse ends in a high-pitched screech, informing the\nother kid of just how young he actually is. Tony fucking hates puberty. </p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d The other boy backs up immediately,\nbrown eyes open and free of any trace of malice.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t there, just means he\nhides it well, Tony thinks.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to startle you. Just wanted to\nlet you know that they\u2019re closing up the labs in about twenty minutes.\u201d </p><p>Tony nods and he thinks, hopes, that this is\nit. That the other boy just came to tell him that and that he is going to leave\nnow. But these eyes \u2013 they stare right into his soul and it makes him feel\nlacking because he knows what they\u2019ll find, he knows what everyone has always\nfound so far. No one has stayed after all.</p><p>\u201cWhat are\nyou working on?\u201d the older boy asks. He seems truly interested and it\u2019s\nconfusing Tony. No one is ever interested in what he\u2019s doing. Not really\nanyway.</p><p>He frowns.\n\u201cWhat? So you can make fun of me?\u201d And damn it if this doesn\u2019t sound absolutely\npathetic. </p><p>\u201cNo, of\ncourse not.\u201d The boy seems honestly insulted at the accusation. (Good, maybe\nhe\u2019ll leave before he can hurt him.) \u201cIt just looks really cool. Is that a\nrobot?\u201d </p><p>Tony\nshrugs, giving up on trying to get him to leave in favor of trying to finish\nhis work before the lab closes. \u201cHe\u2019s supposed to be one.\u201d For some reason the\nextra set of eyes makes him move more carefully and, without any more\nincidents, he manages to finish connecting all the wires. </p><p>He waits.\nSomething is supposed to happen. Or has he messed this up, too? Is he really\nnot capable of doing anything right at all? </p><p>Suddenly\nthe machine makes a sad <i>beep-boop</i>, moving its claw once, twice, three\ntimes before it short circuits and dies down with a gurgling noise. </p><p>Pathetic. </p><p>And Tony?\nHe\u2019s this close to a mental breakdown and he knows he can\u2019t succumb to it here because\nno one is allowed to see Howard Stark\u2019s son cry. Least of all an older guy from\nMIT, smart and on the lower range of popular, who\u2019s going to tell everyone\nabout how much of a scalawag he is.</p><p><i>Stark\nmen are made of iron.</i></p><p>But Tony\nisn\u2019t. </p><p>His body is\nshaking with sleep-deprivation, too much caffeine and shame when he picks up\nthe useless robot that he has already internally labeled Dum-E. He hoped that\nDum-E would show his father that even dummies like him can be useful sometimes\nbut it seems like his old man was right. Like he always is. Tony truly is good\nfor nothing. </p><p>A dummy who\nbuilds dummies who aren\u2019t good for anything either.</p><p>\u201cThat was\npretty impressive,\u201d the other boy interrupts his inner monologue and Tony fails\nto find the sarcasm in his voice but maybe he just can\u2019t even read people\nanymore, so he glares at him. He doesn\u2019t seem to care about it too much,\nthough, and reaches out to inspect the inner workings of the robot with gentle,\nsteady hands.</p><p>His arm is resting lightly against Tony\u2019s and he doesn\u2019t dare to move,\nmind hyper-focused on the contact. The stranger is warm and soft and real and\nTony\u2019s heart aches suddenly with how much he misses his mother\u2019s hugs. So he\ndoesn\u2019t pull away and tries to shift his focus a little until he can tune into\nwhat\u2019s apparently a conversation now.</p><p>\u201cI think if\nyou took a little time to actually sleep this could end up being really\nuseful,\u201d he tells him with a small smile, \u201cI\u2019m actually working on an\nassignment about the most basic form of artificial intelligence. What do you\nsay? We could put your heads together over lunch tomorrow?\u201d </p><p>Tony is too\nstunned at how <i>nice</i> he is being treated to tell him to go fuck himself\nso he simply nods. The other boy grins, seemingly happy about their date. </p><p>\u201cGreat,\nthen tomorrow at Dan\u2019s Diner around noon? My treat.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou do know\nI\u2019m Tony Stark, right?\u201d He frowns then at the weirdly likeable boy who\u2019s clad\nin a loosely fitting t-shirt that has seen better days and worn shoes that are\ndistinctly lacking any real sole at this point and who\u2019s offering to pay for\nhis meal. </p><p>The boy\ncocks an eyebrow and shrugs. \u201cAnd I\u2019m James,\u201d he tells him matter-of-factly,\n\u201cJames Rhodes, not Bond.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a\nboring name,\u201d he can\u2019t stop himself from saying, cringing inwardly at his own\nbluntness, even as he shakes the extended hand. \u201cThere\u2019s no cool nickname for\nJames. I\u2019ll call you Rhodey.\u201d</p><p>He rolls\nhis eyes but they seem to twinkle at the nickname and his voice is pleasantly\nteasing when he answers. \u201cWhatever you say, Tones.\u201d</p><p>Maybe it\u2019s\nthe sleep-deprivation or the looming of despair at yet another failed project.\nMaybe it\u2019s because that\u2019s the first casual conversation he\u2019s had in weeks and\nhe\u2019s been longing for another person to talk to. Or maybe it\u2019s because for some\ninexplicable reason James Rhodes\u2019 company makes him feel safe. </p><p>But for the\nfirst time since leaving Jarvis and his mother behind he laughs, a deep-belly\nlaugh that shakes his whole body up and that warms his chest with something\nother than dreed. </p><p>They end up\nworking on Dum-E for a little over two weeks and when they\u2019re finally finished\nhe can\u2019t talk but he\u2019s capable of understanding basic voice commands and even\nanswers in <i>beep-boop</i>\u2019s that seem to convey emotions such as sadness,\ncheerfulness and anger. (Or maybe they\u2019re imagining that. They have barely\nslept in days.)</p><p>The best thing\nabout getting his robot to work isn\u2019t the fact that they prove Dum-E to be\nactually useful but the way Rhodey becomes the first person in a long time he\nfeels truly comfortable with. </p><p>Rhodey,\never so perceptive, figures out Tony\u2019s bivalent relationship with touches in a\nmatter of days and he\u2019s always careful not to crowd him, backing off when Tony\nneeds it, but there when a gentle touch is all he needs to not fall apart. </p><p>After\nfinishing Dum-E his new friend leans forward carefully, holding his gaze as if\nasking for permission, before he engulfs him in a tight hug. And Tony realizes,\nas he lets himself rest against the older boy\u2019s chest and relaxes in his\nfriend\u2019s arms that this is one of the most peaceful moments in his life. It\ngives him hope for the future that, for once, has nothing to do with being the\nheir of Stark Industries. </p><p>And he vows\nto himself that he won\u2019t ever give up on Dum-E just like Rhodey, for some\nindiscernible reason, never gave up on him.</p><p>.</p><hr><p>\u201cTony! Stop\nfor a second, please!\u201d </p><p>Her raised\nvoice catches him off guard even though it shouldn\u2019t have. He has seen this\ncoming, has prepared for it. Still, when he lowers the spatula his entire body\nhas gone rigid and it\u2019s all he can do to stare at the sizzling pieces of bacon\nin the pan. The sound feels weirdly out of place in the otherwise quiet room and\nhe can only watch them in crude fascination, certain that in a couple of\nminutes they\u2019d be burned and he\u2019d have to throw them away but not moving to\nchange the setting on the stove. </p><p>It\u2019s like\nwaiting for a train wreck you know is going to happen. It\u2019s an apt description\nof his life, he figures.</p><p>Pepper\u2019s\nvoice is soft again and he feels more than hears her step closer to the kitchen\ncounter he\u2019s hiding behind. He can picture the way her long hair falls over her\nshoulders in artistic waves and he knows that there is a frown on her forehead,\na tiny wrinkle sitting right between her eyebrows. He knows the look in her\neyes, the blue eyes that are deeper than the ocean, similarly infinite and so\nmuch more beautiful. </p><p>\u201cCan you\nturn around for me?\u201d she asks, gently and probing but not demanding. Leave it\nto Pepper, the most demanding woman he has ever met, to be the first to let him\ndecide whether to look at her or not.</p><p>He\u2019s sure\nshe knows how much he hates being yelled at and he can\u2019t help but feel thankful\nfor her thoughtfulness. It makes it a little easier for him to release the\ndeath grip is hand has on the wooden spatula. Olive wood, he thinks\nabsentmindedly, his mother always liked the olive wood spatulas, said they\nreminded her of home.</p><p>His skin is\nstill crawling with barely veiled anxiety but he manages to breathe. In through\nthe nose, out through the mouth. </p><p>He finds\nthe tiny remains of his shattered masks somewhere deep inside him and it\u2019s\nenough to make him shake his head.</p><p>\u201cNope.\nDon\u2019t think I can,\u201d he says, voice light and cheerful and oh-so-fake. \u201cGotta\nwatch that bacon before I burn down the house again, right? You told me\nyourself that that\u2019s not a very responsible thing to do and I \u2013\u201c </p><p>Suddenly\nher hand comes into focus, delicate fingers turning down the stove before\nsettling on the countertop. \u00a0</p><p>Again, her\nvoice is so sweet that it runs down his back like honey. It\u2019s warm and a little\nsad and it makes his anxiety spike. His heart is thumping so loudly in his\nchest, he\u2019s sure she hears it too because she sighs very quietly and then her\nhand is gone from his sight and he thought he would feel better but he doesn\u2019t.\nHe feels worse. As if she\u2019s already gone. </p><p>\u201cPep \u2013\u201c he\nall but whispers because he doesn\u2019t know what else to say, how else to explain\nthe fact that he slipped out of bed and left her all on her own after they\nspent the night together. </p><p>Oh god.\nThey spent the night together. They \u2013 </p><p>When her\nvoice comes back it\u2019s accompanied by a feather-light touch on his wrist. No\nforce, just a question. </p><p>\u201cTony,\u201d she\nstarts and he squeezes his eyes shut because he doesn\u2019t want to hear it, can\u2019t\nstomach listening to it but also can\u2019t stop himself wanting more of that\nangle-like voice. \u201cWhy won\u2019t you look at me?\u201d </p><p>He feels\nher slender fingers run over his palm and toy with his. Hers are warm and soft\nwhere his are cold and calloused. They make a good pair, he thinks, and before\nhe can stop himself he intertwines his fingers with hers and pulls her\nmarginally closer. </p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d\nhe whispers, raising their joined hands to his lips to press a kiss to the back\nof hers, \u201cBecause then you\u2019d see me and you\u2019d find that I\u2019m lacking and I\u2019d\njust rather not do that today.\u201d Or any day, really. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve\nalready seen you,\u201d she answers and he can hear the smile in her voice, would\nlove to see it on her lips but is too scared to move. </p><p>Tony shakes\nhis head but doesn\u2019t release her hand. As if he could make her stay if he just\nheld on tightly enough. \u201cNot like this, you haven\u2019t.\u201d </p><p>He\u2019s not\nsure anyone has ever seen him like this. Hell, he\u2019s not even sure he\u2019s ever\nbeen like this \u2013 all butterflies-in-stomach and sweaty palms. </p><p>It\u2019s love,\nhe thinks. But he\u2019s not sure because he\u2019s never felt it before, doesn\u2019t know\nhow it\u2019s supposed to feel like and if people like him even get to experience\nsomething so sacred. If he had to describe it, though, he\u2019d say he\u2019s in love.\nIt\u2019s the scariest thing he has ever felt in his life. </p><p>It\u2019s\nscarier than terrorists in a cave, scarier than falling to his death and\nscarier, even, than his old man\u2019s raised voice and the smell of whiskey hanging\nin the air. </p><p>\u201cYes, I\nhave,\u201d she replies easily, in the no-nonsense voice that only Pepper Potts can\never really pull off, and tugs on his hand. \u201cLook at me, please. I promise I\nwon\u2019t run.\u201d </p><p>Those were\nthe exact words he has wanted to hear, still he can\u2019t help but question their\nsincerity. After all, who did stick around after seeing him? Only Rhodey so\nfar. And Pepper but \u2013</p><p>He turns\naround and meets her eyes and she just holds his gaze.</p><p>The first\nthing he notices is the sleepy sand in the corner of her eyes. Dried rheum \u2013 a\ncombination of mucin, dust, blood cells and skin cells \u2013 entirely gross if it would\nbe anyone else but this is <i>Pepper</i> and he marvels at the sight. </p><p>She has\nnever been this raw in his company and he wants to cherish it and tell her how\nbeautiful she looks without make-up on. He wants to tell her about the sun\nlight reflecting in her eyes and how her freckles are like a treasure map. He\ndoesn\u2019t say any of that, though. </p><p>They just\nlook at each other. </p><p>It\u2019s Pepper\nwho moves first. (Of course she is. That woman is fearless and he\u2019s a mess.) </p><p>Very gently\nshe pulls her hand out of his grasp and takes a step closer before he can complain\nabout the loss of warmth. She raises her hands, telegraphing every movement as\nif she knows that he flinches when someone raises their hand too suddenly (she\nprobably does), and settles them on his cheeks. </p><p>He leans\ninto the comfort she\u2019s providing with her thumbs rubbing circles into his skin.\nHe lets himself relish in the warmth her touch is offering and his free hand\nsettles on her hip, just a few centimeters over the hem of his shirt that she\u2019s\nwearing. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a\nmess,\u201d he tells her, eyes closed and she is so close he feels her body vibrate\nwith soft chuckles and her hot breath is tickling his chin. </p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d\nshe answers and without having to look he knows that she\u2019s grinning up at him\nin a way that makes the dimples on her cheek stand out. \u201cBut I\u2019ve known that\nbefore.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going\nto mess up. I\u2019m not good at \u2013 this.\u201d He\u2019s not sure why he is trying to make her\nturn away but he knows that he has to be open if this can have any chance of\nworking out. God, he wants it to work out so badly. </p><p>Her reply\nis instant and makes his eyes fly open. \u201cWell, then you apologize and work on\nmaking it better the next time around. You\u2019ll improve. We both will. It\u2019s what\npeople do in a relationship.\u201d </p><p>Again she\nmeets his gaze warmly and without hesitation, a smile curving her lips upwards\njust the tiniest bit. </p><p>It\u2019s in\nthat moment that his love for her overwhelms him. It comes crashing down like a\nwave of adoration and appreciation and devotion and for a second he\u2019s stumbling\nuntil he regains his balance and matches her smile with his. </p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t\nknow what people do in a relationship, Ms. Potts.\u201d He grins down at her\ncheekily and a weight falls off his chest when she starts laughing loudly. </p><p>\u201cBelieve\nme, I know,\u201d she smirks and leans up to press a lingering kiss to his lips,\n\u201cBut I think I\u2019m up to the challenge, Mr. Stark.\u201d </p><p>Her hands\nare still resting on his face and it feels like they have always been there, as\nif this is supposed to be. As if they were meant to be.</p><p>It takes\nthem a lot of effort and ups and downs but Pepper\u2019s touch slowly glues all his\nbroken pieces back together, blowing kisses to the faint scars that remain.</p><p>.\u00a0\u00a0</p><hr><p>When he\nhears the blood rushing in his ears and feels his heart beat violently in his\nchest out of nowhere, he stops mid-movement. Screwdriver in hand with his body\nbent over the wiring of the suit he\u2019s working on he tries to take a deep breath\njust to see if he can. </p><p>It works\nsurprisingly well but the sensation of his body shaking with every beat of his\nheart - like it\u2019s a wrecking ball not a pump - is still there and while it\u2019s\nnothing entirely new he really doesn\u2019t enjoy the feeling of his ribcage\nthreatening to tear open with every <i>thump</i> of the vital organ. </p><p>Quietly he\nsets down the tool and moves his right hand to rest over his sternum, right\nabove the scar where his arc reactor used to sit. The feeling of skin on skin\nand the light pressure he puts on his thorax help ground him only marginally\nand his stupid heartrate is hell bent on accelerating no matter how evenly he\nbreathes which is just annoying. </p><p>His left\nhand comes up, fingers routinely grabbing his radial pulse point as he tries to\nwill his heart to slow down. The moves have become instinctually over the\nyears. Having had shrapnel mere millimeters from one of the few things he quite\nliterally can\u2019t live without has made him hyperaware of everything that might\nbe going wonky in his chest. </p><p>It\u2019s that\nhyper-fixation that makes even the smallest palpitation seem like a coronary,\ncomplete with mortal agony and phantom pain spreading into his left arm until\nhis pinky starts cramping. \u00a0 </p><p><i>Three\ncounts in, five counts out. </i></p><p>He coaches\nhimself to breathe evenly. The chances of this actually being a heart attack\nare slim to none. His doctor had him checked out just three days ago.<i> </i>As\nthe doc would say: his fear is understandable but unnecessary. It\u2019s fine. Just\na random spike of anxiety that doesn\u2019t mean anything.</p><p><i>Three in.\nFive out. </i></p><p><i>One,\nTwo, Three. </i></p><p><i>One,\nTwo, Three, Four, Five. </i></p><p><i>Again.</i></p><p>\u201cMister Stark? Are you okay?\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 </p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d he\nopens his eyes all at once to see Peter standing next to his work station, a\ntube of something in his hand, worrying at his bottom lip as he watches Tony\ncling to his own chest. </p><p>Upon seeing\nthe big brown eyes that peep out under the messy shock of curls he feels warmth\nspread through his chest like a wildfire. It\u2019s almost unpleasantly fast but it\nleaves a field of peace in its wake which is doing more in calming his racing\nheart than any breathing exercise he\u2019s tried so far. There\u2019s something\nundeniably powerful about this kid\u2019s presence to ground him to reality. </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he\nsays and when the words leave his mouth they\u2019re barely a lie anymore but they have\na pact where they don\u2019t lie at all, so he tags on, \u201cJust my heart running riot\nfor no apparent reason. Don\u2019t worry about it. What were you working on? Is that\nChemistry project going well? Do you need help?\u201d </p><p>As has\nbecome the norm in moments like these, Peter completely ignores his attempts to\nchange the topic and cocks his head to the side in a mix of worry, amusement\nand plain adoration as he gingerly takes a seat on the swivel chair next to his\nmentor. </p><p>God. His\nlove for this kid is making his heart clench painfully. He\u2019s never really\nexperienced this kind of unconditional love before and some days it feels like\nhis body hasn\u2019t been made with emotions like that in mind. They\u2019re burning too\nhot when he\u2019s freezing, leaving him reeling and unsure of where to turn.</p><p>\u201cDid you\ntake your meds?\u201d He turns on the chair until his left thigh is resting against\nTony\u2019s right knee and the petite touch is incredibly welcome, almost\ndisturbingly calming. </p><p>He makes a\nface because he doesn\u2019t like talking about his mental health and everything\nthat\u2019s wrong with it but he relents with a soft sigh and a shake of his head.\n\u201cNope. Doc said we could taper off them as long as I keep seeing her and\nnothing new comes up. But it\u2019s fine, Pete. I promise. Just not all that comfortable,\nthat\u2019s it.\u201d </p><p>When Peter\nonly pouts but doesn\u2019t argue any further, he eases his hands down from his own chest\nand rests them on the kid\u2019s shoulders instead, preening inwardly when the boy\nmeets his gaze openly without further prodding. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not\ngoing to die in the next couple hours. I promise.\u201d </p><p>The\nteenager relaxes then, huffing and leaning forward to rest his forehead on his\nmentor\u2019s shoulder and like clockwork calloused fingers find the tense spots on\nhis neck and start kneading it gently. \u201cI just \u2013 worry. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTell you\nwhat,\u201d Tony grins, standing up and pulling the kid with him, \u201cLet\u2019s call it a\nday down here and catch a movie until Pep gets home for dinner, whataya say?\u201d </p><p>\u201cCan we\njust listen to music?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure we\ncan, bud.\u201d </p><p>They end up\nlistening to one of the few recorded pieces of Guido Agosti, an Italian pianist\nthat taught his mom to play when she was young and it brings him back to a time\nwhen touch was not yet forbidden. A time when Maria Stark would sing him to\nsleep and he stayed up well past his bed-time only to listen to her play. </p><p>Sometimes\nthey would listen to recordings together, from her priced possession of vinyl\nand those are some of the few moments of his childhood that he still revisits\nfrequently and joyfully albeit with a heavy heart. </p><p>It\u2019s not\nthat all that different now. </p><p>Peter\u2019s ear\nis resting right above his heart, his breathing coming out in soft even puffs\nof warm air against Tony\u2019s collarbone. He\u2019s curled up into him, fitting into\nTony\u2019s embrace like he was meant to end up here. Like this has been life\u2019s\ngrand goal all along and if that\u2019s true then Tony can\u2019t even be mad at\neverything that\u2019s happened so far. </p><p>His fingers\nrun through the mess of curls ever so gently, working on the numerous knots with\na proficiency that has come with hours and hours of practice. </p><p>The kid\u2019s\nalready starting to nod off to the quiet calming sounds of his mother\u2019s\nchildhood hero and he pulls him impossibly closer, index and middle finger\ncoming to rest over the soft thump of his temporal pulse point. </p><p>Peter\nParker came into his life when he was lost, only held together by Rhodey and\nPepper but always dangerously close to falling apart. He thought there was no\nmore room in his heart. That there was no way someone could get past the\nbarriers he\u2019s built over the years and, honestly, he didn\u2019t think there was any\nneed to. </p><p>Somehow,\nand without meaning to, Peter has barreled past all of them and quietly but\nfirmly made room between all the scars and the betrayal and the fear. He settled\ndown between all the pieces, build himself a shelter and, simultaneously,\nfilled an aching hole in Tony\u2019s chest that he hadn\u2019t even realized was there. </p><p>Tony leans\nover to pull a blanket on top of both of them, smiling into Peter\u2019s hair when\nhe nestles closer and lets out a soft snore. Before he drifts off to sleep,\nheart beating strong and steady and normally in his chest, he presses a kiss to\nhis temple. </p><p>\u201cI love\nyou, Petey. Never change. Not like I did.\u201d</p>",
                "content": "<p><b>Relationships</b>: Rhodey &amp; Tony, Pepper / Tony, Peter &amp; Tony, <b><i>Tony &amp; Touch</i></b></p><p><a href=\"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13059717/13/Infinite-Possible-Ways-To-Love-You\">FF.net</a> I <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/18250304\">ao3</a></p><hr /><p>Tony had\nalways craved touch.<br /></p><p>When he was\na toddler, the only way for Maria and Jarvis to calm him down or get him to\nsleep was always through touch. </p><p>Maria would\nhug him and sing him a lullaby, lips so close to his ear that he felt her warm\nbreath on his skin and only then, when he was certain that his mother was there\nwith him, would he relent and close his eyes, falling asleep almost immediately.\n</p><p>Jarvis\nwould calm the body shaking sobs and soul splitting screams he tried to bury in\nhis pillow by running a warm hand up and down his spine, whispering soothing\nwords that Tony never really picked up on. </p><p>It was always\nthe touch of a person he trusted that kept him from falling apart any further.\nIt was the touch that was his crutch when he couldn&rsquo;t stand back up on his own.\nTouch was the glue that held all of his broken pieces together even when he\nhimself had given up on repairing the damage because it seemed futile.</p><hr /><p>When he meets\nRhodey he has long since come to accept that needing someone else&rsquo;s touch is a\nweakness. A weakness that he can&rsquo;t afford if he wants to make his father proud.<br /></p><p><i>Stark\nmen are made of iron.</i></p><p>It&rsquo;s etched\ninto his heart, the incision aching with every beat, and he feels his father&rsquo;s\nword in his lungs with every breath he takes. Like acid the words dissolve him\nfrom the inside, battling the very core of who he is &ndash; <i>was</i>.</p><p>He&rsquo;s 15 and\nhe&rsquo;s by far the youngest student on the MIT campus. </p><p>Everything\nand <i>everyone</i> around him feels so much bigger than he is, than what he\nfeels like, but he&rsquo;s used to feeling small and worthless so he squares his\nshoulders and he puts on the persona that has gotten him through his one\ndreadful year of high school. He&rsquo;s smart, he&rsquo;s sassy and he doesn&rsquo;t mince his\nwords. He lets everyone know exactly who he is. </p><p>It doesn&rsquo;t\ntake him more than two weeks to troop together a group of people who <i>love</i>\nhanging out with Howard Stark&rsquo;s son. (It just happens to be Tony, he knows\nthat.)</p><p>It takes\nhim three parties to get his reputation as a player. (Because sex, he was\ntaught, is the only physical connection that is about control not weakness and\nhe can&rsquo;t shut down the last pathetic part of him that still craves human contact.)\n</p><p>James Rhodes is not a player. He shows up to some parties, he socializes\neasily and is an all-around all-liked person. He speaks his mind but he does so\nin a polite way, inviting discussion and discourse as long as it&rsquo;s on-topic und\nrespectful. He doesn&rsquo;t let frustration and anger cloud his judgement. He&rsquo;s\nresilient in his work and his intelligence is quiet and steady. </p><p>In short,\nhe&rsquo;s everything Tony is not and normally their paths would never have crossed. </p><p>Maybe it&rsquo;s\nfate that decides that they should meet. Maybe it&rsquo;s just dumb luck. Whatever it\nis, Tony is grateful they do. </p><p>When they do, Tony is running on four hours of sleep\nin just as many days and he&rsquo;s shaking like a leaf. His hands are trying to\nconnect the last few wires on his robot but they&rsquo;re too jittery to perform the\ndelicate action and he ends up electrocuting himself. Just for a moment,\nthough, and no one else in the big lab seems to notice so he just keeps going\nlike he always does.</p><p>That is until a heavy hand settles on his\nshoulder, making him flinch so hard he drops both the unfinished robot and his\ntools. Every little fiber in him is screaming alarm. Sudden touches can only\never mean pain and he is too tired to deal with any more of that right now, too\nhollow to put up his mask.</p><p>Somehow he manages to keep himself from yelping\nbut when he turns and his eyes land on the other boy who&rsquo;s standing way too\nclose for comfort, his fear morphs into anger. (Anger, Howard taught him, demands\nrespect and installs fear in his opponent.)</p><p>&ldquo;What the actual fuck?&rdquo; he exclaims. What\nstarted as a deep manly curse ends in a high-pitched screech, informing the\nother kid of just how young he actually is. Tony fucking hates puberty. </p><p>&ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo; The other boy backs up immediately,\nbrown eyes open and free of any trace of malice.</p><p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean it isn&rsquo;t there, just means he\nhides it well, Tony thinks.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to startle you. Just wanted to\nlet you know that they&rsquo;re closing up the labs in about twenty minutes.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony nods and he thinks, hopes, that this is\nit. That the other boy just came to tell him that and that he is going to leave\nnow. But these eyes &ndash; they stare right into his soul and it makes him feel\nlacking because he knows what they&rsquo;ll find, he knows what everyone has always\nfound so far. No one has stayed after all.</p><p>&ldquo;What are\nyou working on?&rdquo; the older boy asks. He seems truly interested and it&rsquo;s\nconfusing Tony. No one is ever interested in what he&rsquo;s doing. Not really\nanyway.</p><p>He frowns.\n&ldquo;What? So you can make fun of me?&rdquo; And damn it if this doesn&rsquo;t sound absolutely\npathetic. </p><p>&ldquo;No, of\ncourse not.&rdquo; The boy seems honestly insulted at the accusation. (Good, maybe\nhe&rsquo;ll leave before he can hurt him.) &ldquo;It just looks really cool. Is that a\nrobot?&rdquo; </p><p>Tony\nshrugs, giving up on trying to get him to leave in favor of trying to finish\nhis work before the lab closes. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s supposed to be one.&rdquo; For some reason the\nextra set of eyes makes him move more carefully and, without any more\nincidents, he manages to finish connecting all the wires. </p><p>He waits.\nSomething is supposed to happen. Or has he messed this up, too? Is he really\nnot capable of doing anything right at all? </p><p>Suddenly\nthe machine makes a sad <i>beep-boop</i>, moving its claw once, twice, three\ntimes before it short circuits and dies down with a gurgling noise. </p><p>Pathetic. </p><p>And Tony?\nHe&rsquo;s this close to a mental breakdown and he knows he can&rsquo;t succumb to it here because\nno one is allowed to see Howard Stark&rsquo;s son cry. Least of all an older guy from\nMIT, smart and on the lower range of popular, who&rsquo;s going to tell everyone\nabout how much of a scalawag he is.</p><p><i>Stark\nmen are made of iron.</i></p><p>But Tony\nisn&rsquo;t. </p><p>His body is\nshaking with sleep-deprivation, too much caffeine and shame when he picks up\nthe useless robot that he has already internally labeled Dum-E. He hoped that\nDum-E would show his father that even dummies like him can be useful sometimes\nbut it seems like his old man was right. Like he always is. Tony truly is good\nfor nothing. </p><p>A dummy who\nbuilds dummies who aren&rsquo;t good for anything either.</p><p>&ldquo;That was\npretty impressive,&rdquo; the other boy interrupts his inner monologue and Tony fails\nto find the sarcasm in his voice but maybe he just can&rsquo;t even read people\nanymore, so he glares at him. He doesn&rsquo;t seem to care about it too much,\nthough, and reaches out to inspect the inner workings of the robot with gentle,\nsteady hands.</p><p>His arm is resting lightly against Tony&rsquo;s and he doesn&rsquo;t dare to move,\nmind hyper-focused on the contact. The stranger is warm and soft and real and\nTony&rsquo;s heart aches suddenly with how much he misses his mother&rsquo;s hugs. So he\ndoesn&rsquo;t pull away and tries to shift his focus a little until he can tune into\nwhat&rsquo;s apparently a conversation now.</p><p>&ldquo;I think if\nyou took a little time to actually sleep this could end up being really\nuseful,&rdquo; he tells him with a small smile, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m actually working on an\nassignment about the most basic form of artificial intelligence. What do you\nsay? We could put your heads together over lunch tomorrow?&rdquo; </p><p>Tony is too\nstunned at how <i>nice</i> he is being treated to tell him to go fuck himself\nso he simply nods. The other boy grins, seemingly happy about their date. </p><p>&ldquo;Great,\nthen tomorrow at Dan&rsquo;s Diner around noon? My treat.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You do know\nI&rsquo;m Tony Stark, right?&rdquo; He frowns then at the weirdly likeable boy who&rsquo;s clad\nin a loosely fitting t-shirt that has seen better days and worn shoes that are\ndistinctly lacking any real sole at this point and who&rsquo;s offering to pay for\nhis meal. </p><p>The boy\ncocks an eyebrow and shrugs. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m James,&rdquo; he tells him matter-of-factly,\n&ldquo;James Rhodes, not Bond.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a\nboring name,&rdquo; he can&rsquo;t stop himself from saying, cringing inwardly at his own\nbluntness, even as he shakes the extended hand. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no cool nickname for\nJames. I&rsquo;ll call you Rhodey.&rdquo;</p><p>He rolls\nhis eyes but they seem to twinkle at the nickname and his voice is pleasantly\nteasing when he answers. &ldquo;Whatever you say, Tones.&rdquo;</p><p>Maybe it&rsquo;s\nthe sleep-deprivation or the looming of despair at yet another failed project.\nMaybe it&rsquo;s because that&rsquo;s the first casual conversation he&rsquo;s had in weeks and\nhe&rsquo;s been longing for another person to talk to. Or maybe it&rsquo;s because for some\ninexplicable reason James Rhodes&rsquo; company makes him feel safe. </p><p>But for the\nfirst time since leaving Jarvis and his mother behind he laughs, a deep-belly\nlaugh that shakes his whole body up and that warms his chest with something\nother than dreed. </p><p>They end up\nworking on Dum-E for a little over two weeks and when they&rsquo;re finally finished\nhe can&rsquo;t talk but he&rsquo;s capable of understanding basic voice commands and even\nanswers in <i>beep-boop</i>&rsquo;s that seem to convey emotions such as sadness,\ncheerfulness and anger. (Or maybe they&rsquo;re imagining that. They have barely\nslept in days.)</p><p>The best thing\nabout getting his robot to work isn&rsquo;t the fact that they prove Dum-E to be\nactually useful but the way Rhodey becomes the first person in a long time he\nfeels truly comfortable with. </p><p>Rhodey,\never so perceptive, figures out Tony&rsquo;s bivalent relationship with touches in a\nmatter of days and he&rsquo;s always careful not to crowd him, backing off when Tony\nneeds it, but there when a gentle touch is all he needs to not fall apart. </p><p>After\nfinishing Dum-E his new friend leans forward carefully, holding his gaze as if\nasking for permission, before he engulfs him in a tight hug. And Tony realizes,\nas he lets himself rest against the older boy&rsquo;s chest and relaxes in his\nfriend&rsquo;s arms that this is one of the most peaceful moments in his life. It\ngives him hope for the future that, for once, has nothing to do with being the\nheir of Stark Industries. </p><p>And he vows\nto himself that he won&rsquo;t ever give up on Dum-E just like Rhodey, for some\nindiscernible reason, never gave up on him.</p><p>.</p><hr /><p>&ldquo;Tony! Stop\nfor a second, please!&rdquo; </p><p>Her raised\nvoice catches him off guard even though it shouldn&rsquo;t have. He has seen this\ncoming, has prepared for it. Still, when he lowers the spatula his entire body\nhas gone rigid and it&rsquo;s all he can do to stare at the sizzling pieces of bacon\nin the pan. The sound feels weirdly out of place in the otherwise quiet room and\nhe can only watch them in crude fascination, certain that in a couple of\nminutes they&rsquo;d be burned and he&rsquo;d have to throw them away but not moving to\nchange the setting on the stove. </p><p>It&rsquo;s like\nwaiting for a train wreck you know is going to happen. It&rsquo;s an apt description\nof his life, he figures.</p><p>Pepper&rsquo;s\nvoice is soft again and he feels more than hears her step closer to the kitchen\ncounter he&rsquo;s hiding behind. He can picture the way her long hair falls over her\nshoulders in artistic waves and he knows that there is a frown on her forehead,\na tiny wrinkle sitting right between her eyebrows. He knows the look in her\neyes, the blue eyes that are deeper than the ocean, similarly infinite and so\nmuch more beautiful. </p><p>&ldquo;Can you\nturn around for me?&rdquo; she asks, gently and probing but not demanding. Leave it\nto Pepper, the most demanding woman he has ever met, to be the first to let him\ndecide whether to look at her or not.</p><p>He&rsquo;s sure\nshe knows how much he hates being yelled at and he can&rsquo;t help but feel thankful\nfor her thoughtfulness. It makes it a little easier for him to release the\ndeath grip is hand has on the wooden spatula. Olive wood, he thinks\nabsentmindedly, his mother always liked the olive wood spatulas, said they\nreminded her of home.</p><p>His skin is\nstill crawling with barely veiled anxiety but he manages to breathe. In through\nthe nose, out through the mouth. </p><p>He finds\nthe tiny remains of his shattered masks somewhere deep inside him and it&rsquo;s\nenough to make him shake his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Nope.\nDon&rsquo;t think I can,&rdquo; he says, voice light and cheerful and oh-so-fake. &ldquo;Gotta\nwatch that bacon before I burn down the house again, right? You told me\nyourself that that&rsquo;s not a very responsible thing to do and I &ndash;&ldquo; </p><p>Suddenly\nher hand comes into focus, delicate fingers turning down the stove before\nsettling on the countertop. &nbsp;</p><p>Again, her\nvoice is so sweet that it runs down his back like honey. It&rsquo;s warm and a little\nsad and it makes his anxiety spike. His heart is thumping so loudly in his\nchest, he&rsquo;s sure she hears it too because she sighs very quietly and then her\nhand is gone from his sight and he thought he would feel better but he doesn&rsquo;t.\nHe feels worse. As if she&rsquo;s already gone. </p><p>&ldquo;Pep &ndash;&ldquo; he\nall but whispers because he doesn&rsquo;t know what else to say, how else to explain\nthe fact that he slipped out of bed and left her all on her own after they\nspent the night together. </p><p>Oh god.\nThey spent the night together. They &ndash; </p><p>When her\nvoice comes back it&rsquo;s accompanied by a feather-light touch on his wrist. No\nforce, just a question. </p><p>&ldquo;Tony,&rdquo; she\nstarts and he squeezes his eyes shut because he doesn&rsquo;t want to hear it, can&rsquo;t\nstomach listening to it but also can&rsquo;t stop himself wanting more of that\nangle-like voice. &ldquo;Why won&rsquo;t you look at me?&rdquo; </p><p>He feels\nher slender fingers run over his palm and toy with his. Hers are warm and soft\nwhere his are cold and calloused. They make a good pair, he thinks, and before\nhe can stop himself he intertwines his fingers with hers and pulls her\nmarginally closer. </p><p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo;\nhe whispers, raising their joined hands to his lips to press a kiss to the back\nof hers, &ldquo;Because then you&rsquo;d see me and you&rsquo;d find that I&rsquo;m lacking and I&rsquo;d\njust rather not do that today.&rdquo; Or any day, really. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve\nalready seen you,&rdquo; she answers and he can hear the smile in her voice, would\nlove to see it on her lips but is too scared to move. </p><p>Tony shakes\nhis head but doesn&rsquo;t release her hand. As if he could make her stay if he just\nheld on tightly enough. &ldquo;Not like this, you haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo; </p><p>He&rsquo;s not\nsure anyone has ever seen him like this. Hell, he&rsquo;s not even sure he&rsquo;s ever\nbeen like this &ndash; all butterflies-in-stomach and sweaty palms. </p><p>It&rsquo;s love,\nhe thinks. But he&rsquo;s not sure because he&rsquo;s never felt it before, doesn&rsquo;t know\nhow it&rsquo;s supposed to feel like and if people like him even get to experience\nsomething so sacred. If he had to describe it, though, he&rsquo;d say he&rsquo;s in love.\nIt&rsquo;s the scariest thing he has ever felt in his life. </p><p>It&rsquo;s\nscarier than terrorists in a cave, scarier than falling to his death and\nscarier, even, than his old man&rsquo;s raised voice and the smell of whiskey hanging\nin the air. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I\nhave,&rdquo; she replies easily, in the no-nonsense voice that only Pepper Potts can\never really pull off, and tugs on his hand. &ldquo;Look at me, please. I promise I\nwon&rsquo;t run.&rdquo; </p><p>Those were\nthe exact words he has wanted to hear, still he can&rsquo;t help but question their\nsincerity. After all, who did stick around after seeing him? Only Rhodey so\nfar. And Pepper but &ndash;</p><p>He turns\naround and meets her eyes and she just holds his gaze.</p><p>The first\nthing he notices is the sleepy sand in the corner of her eyes. Dried rheum &ndash; a\ncombination of mucin, dust, blood cells and skin cells &ndash; entirely gross if it would\nbe anyone else but this is <i>Pepper</i> and he marvels at the sight. </p><p>She has\nnever been this raw in his company and he wants to cherish it and tell her how\nbeautiful she looks without make-up on. He wants to tell her about the sun\nlight reflecting in her eyes and how her freckles are like a treasure map. He\ndoesn&rsquo;t say any of that, though. </p><p>They just\nlook at each other. </p><p>It&rsquo;s Pepper\nwho moves first. (Of course she is. That woman is fearless and he&rsquo;s a mess.) </p><p>Very gently\nshe pulls her hand out of his grasp and takes a step closer before he can complain\nabout the loss of warmth. She raises her hands, telegraphing every movement as\nif she knows that he flinches when someone raises their hand too suddenly (she\nprobably does), and settles them on his cheeks. </p><p>He leans\ninto the comfort she&rsquo;s providing with her thumbs rubbing circles into his skin.\nHe lets himself relish in the warmth her touch is offering and his free hand\nsettles on her hip, just a few centimeters over the hem of his shirt that she&rsquo;s\nwearing. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a\nmess,&rdquo; he tells her, eyes closed and she is so close he feels her body vibrate\nwith soft chuckles and her hot breath is tickling his chin. </p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo;\nshe answers and without having to look he knows that she&rsquo;s grinning up at him\nin a way that makes the dimples on her cheek stand out. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve known that\nbefore.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going\nto mess up. I&rsquo;m not good at &ndash; this.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s not sure why he is trying to make her\nturn away but he knows that he has to be open if this can have any chance of\nworking out. God, he wants it to work out so badly. </p><p>Her reply\nis instant and makes his eyes fly open. &ldquo;Well, then you apologize and work on\nmaking it better the next time around. You&rsquo;ll improve. We both will. It&rsquo;s what\npeople do in a relationship.&rdquo; </p><p>Again she\nmeets his gaze warmly and without hesitation, a smile curving her lips upwards\njust the tiniest bit. </p><p>It&rsquo;s in\nthat moment that his love for her overwhelms him. It comes crashing down like a\nwave of adoration and appreciation and devotion and for a second he&rsquo;s stumbling\nuntil he regains his balance and matches her smile with his. </p><p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t\nknow what people do in a relationship, Ms. Potts.&rdquo; He grins down at her\ncheekily and a weight falls off his chest when she starts laughing loudly. </p><p>&ldquo;Believe\nme, I know,&rdquo; she smirks and leans up to press a lingering kiss to his lips,\n&ldquo;But I think I&rsquo;m up to the challenge, Mr. Stark.&rdquo; </p><p>Her hands\nare still resting on his face and it feels like they have always been there, as\nif this is supposed to be. As if they were meant to be.</p><p>It takes\nthem a lot of effort and ups and downs but Pepper&rsquo;s touch slowly glues all his\nbroken pieces back together, blowing kisses to the faint scars that remain.</p><p>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><hr /><p>When he\nhears the blood rushing in his ears and feels his heart beat violently in his\nchest out of nowhere, he stops mid-movement. Screwdriver in hand with his body\nbent over the wiring of the suit he&rsquo;s working on he tries to take a deep breath\njust to see if he can. </p><p>It works\nsurprisingly well but the sensation of his body shaking with every beat of his\nheart - like it&rsquo;s a wrecking ball not a pump - is still there and while it&rsquo;s\nnothing entirely new he really doesn&rsquo;t enjoy the feeling of his ribcage\nthreatening to tear open with every <i>thump</i> of the vital organ. </p><p>Quietly he\nsets down the tool and moves his right hand to rest over his sternum, right\nabove the scar where his arc reactor used to sit. The feeling of skin on skin\nand the light pressure he puts on his thorax help ground him only marginally\nand his stupid heartrate is hell bent on accelerating no matter how evenly he\nbreathes which is just annoying. </p><p>His left\nhand comes up, fingers routinely grabbing his radial pulse point as he tries to\nwill his heart to slow down. The moves have become instinctually over the\nyears. Having had shrapnel mere millimeters from one of the few things he quite\nliterally can&rsquo;t live without has made him hyperaware of everything that might\nbe going wonky in his chest. </p><p>It&rsquo;s that\nhyper-fixation that makes even the smallest palpitation seem like a coronary,\ncomplete with mortal agony and phantom pain spreading into his left arm until\nhis pinky starts cramping. &nbsp; </p><p><i>Three\ncounts in, five counts out. </i></p><p>He coaches\nhimself to breathe evenly. The chances of this actually being a heart attack\nare slim to none. His doctor had him checked out just three days ago.<i> </i>As\nthe doc would say: his fear is understandable but unnecessary. It&rsquo;s fine. Just\na random spike of anxiety that doesn&rsquo;t mean anything.</p><p><i>Three in.\nFive out. </i></p><p><i>One,\nTwo, Three. </i></p><p><i>One,\nTwo, Three, Four, Five. </i></p><p><i>Again.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Mister Stark? Are you okay?&rdquo; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; he\nopens his eyes all at once to see Peter standing next to his work station, a\ntube of something in his hand, worrying at his bottom lip as he watches Tony\ncling to his own chest. </p><p>Upon seeing\nthe big brown eyes that peep out under the messy shock of curls he feels warmth\nspread through his chest like a wildfire. It&rsquo;s almost unpleasantly fast but it\nleaves a field of peace in its wake which is doing more in calming his racing\nheart than any breathing exercise he&rsquo;s tried so far. There&rsquo;s something\nundeniably powerful about this kid&rsquo;s presence to ground him to reality. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he\nsays and when the words leave his mouth they&rsquo;re barely a lie anymore but they have\na pact where they don&rsquo;t lie at all, so he tags on, &ldquo;Just my heart running riot\nfor no apparent reason. Don&rsquo;t worry about it. What were you working on? Is that\nChemistry project going well? Do you need help?&rdquo; </p><p>As has\nbecome the norm in moments like these, Peter completely ignores his attempts to\nchange the topic and cocks his head to the side in a mix of worry, amusement\nand plain adoration as he gingerly takes a seat on the swivel chair next to his\nmentor. </p><p>God. His\nlove for this kid is making his heart clench painfully. He&rsquo;s never really\nexperienced this kind of unconditional love before and some days it feels like\nhis body hasn&rsquo;t been made with emotions like that in mind. They&rsquo;re burning too\nhot when he&rsquo;s freezing, leaving him reeling and unsure of where to turn.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you\ntake your meds?&rdquo; He turns on the chair until his left thigh is resting against\nTony&rsquo;s right knee and the petite touch is incredibly welcome, almost\ndisturbingly calming. </p><p>He makes a\nface because he doesn&rsquo;t like talking about his mental health and everything\nthat&rsquo;s wrong with it but he relents with a soft sigh and a shake of his head.\n&ldquo;Nope. Doc said we could taper off them as long as I keep seeing her and\nnothing new comes up. But it&rsquo;s fine, Pete. I promise. Just not all that comfortable,\nthat&rsquo;s it.&rdquo; </p><p>When Peter\nonly pouts but doesn&rsquo;t argue any further, he eases his hands down from his own chest\nand rests them on the kid&rsquo;s shoulders instead, preening inwardly when the boy\nmeets his gaze openly without further prodding. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not\ngoing to die in the next couple hours. I promise.&rdquo; </p><p>The\nteenager relaxes then, huffing and leaning forward to rest his forehead on his\nmentor&rsquo;s shoulder and like clockwork calloused fingers find the tense spots on\nhis neck and start kneading it gently. &ldquo;I just &ndash; worry. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Tell you\nwhat,&rdquo; Tony grins, standing up and pulling the kid with him, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s call it a\nday down here and catch a movie until Pep gets home for dinner, whataya say?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Can we\njust listen to music?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Sure we\ncan, bud.&rdquo; </p><p>They end up\nlistening to one of the few recorded pieces of Guido Agosti, an Italian pianist\nthat taught his mom to play when she was young and it brings him back to a time\nwhen touch was not yet forbidden. A time when Maria Stark would sing him to\nsleep and he stayed up well past his bed-time only to listen to her play. </p><p>Sometimes\nthey would listen to recordings together, from her priced possession of vinyl\nand those are some of the few moments of his childhood that he still revisits\nfrequently and joyfully albeit with a heavy heart. </p><p>It&rsquo;s not\nthat all that different now. </p><p>Peter&rsquo;s ear\nis resting right above his heart, his breathing coming out in soft even puffs\nof warm air against Tony&rsquo;s collarbone. He&rsquo;s curled up into him, fitting into\nTony&rsquo;s embrace like he was meant to end up here. Like this has been life&rsquo;s\ngrand goal all along and if that&rsquo;s true then Tony can&rsquo;t even be mad at\neverything that&rsquo;s happened so far. </p><p>His fingers\nrun through the mess of curls ever so gently, working on the numerous knots with\na proficiency that has come with hours and hours of practice. </p><p>The kid&rsquo;s\nalready starting to nod off to the quiet calming sounds of his mother&rsquo;s\nchildhood hero and he pulls him impossibly closer, index and middle finger\ncoming to rest over the soft thump of his temporal pulse point. </p><p>Peter\nParker came into his life when he was lost, only held together by Rhodey and\nPepper but always dangerously close to falling apart. He thought there was no\nmore room in his heart. That there was no way someone could get past the\nbarriers he&rsquo;s built over the years and, honestly, he didn&rsquo;t think there was any\nneed to. </p><p>Somehow,\nand without meaning to, Peter has barreled past all of them and quietly but\nfirmly made room between all the scars and the betrayal and the fear. He settled\ndown between all the pieces, build himself a shelter and, simultaneously,\nfilled an aching hole in Tony&rsquo;s chest that he hadn&rsquo;t even realized was there. </p><p>Tony leans\nover to pull a blanket on top of both of them, smiling into Peter&rsquo;s hair when\nhe nestles closer and lets out a soft snore. Before he drifts off to sleep,\nheart beating strong and steady and normally in his chest, he presses a kiss to\nhis temple. </p><p>&ldquo;I love\nyou, Petey. Never change. Not like I did.&rdquo;</p>",

A weakness that he can&rsquo;t afford if he wants to make his father proud.<br /></p>\n<p><i>Stark\nmen are made of iron.</i></p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s etched\ninto his heart, the incision aching with every beat, and he feels his father&rsquo;s\nword in his lungs with every breath he takes. Like acid the words dissolve him\nfrom the inside, battling the very core of who he is &ndash; <i>was</i>.</p>\n<p>He&rsquo;s 15 and\nhe&rsquo;s by far the youngest student on the MIT campus. </p>\n<p>Everything\nand <i>everyone</i> around him feels so much bigger than he is, than what he\nfeels like, but he&rsquo;s used to feeling small and worthless so he squares his\nshoulders and he puts on the persona that has gotten him through his one\ndreadful year of high school. He&rsquo;s smart, he&rsquo;s sassy and he doesn&rsquo;t mince his\nwords. He lets everyone know exactly who he is. </p>\n<p>It doesn&rsquo;t\ntake him more than two weeks to troop together a group of people who <i>love</i>\nhanging out with Howard Stark&rsquo;s son. (It just happens to be Tony, he knows\nthat.)</p>\n<p>It takes\nhim three parties to get his reputation as a player. (Because sex, he was\ntaught, is the only physical connection that is about control not weakness and\nhe can&rsquo;t shut down the last pathetic part of him that still craves human contact.)\n</p>\n</p>",
