This has been Jon's sl since S1, and to hand the kill to Arya just for shock value (they as much as admitted that), while Jon flew/ ran around accomplishing nothing was terrible storytelling. I feel like his entire story arc was made meaningless, which is awful since he is the central,protagonist. Am I wrong?",

                "content": "<p>Ever since GoT passed ASoFI, de-brained Tyrion, and turned Daenerys into a fake Marvel superhero, I took those as signs to reset my expectation to &ldquo;entertaining&rdquo;.&nbsp; So despite 8x03&prime;s many flaws, it was very entertaining and I didn&rsquo;t find myself let down in the least.&nbsp; Reminder, the keyword is entertaining.&nbsp; I know it make no tactical sense (okay it was stupid) to have the Dothraki&nbsp;cavalry charge into the zombie armies in the dark open field, but it was hella cool visuals and then to see the horror on the characters&rsquo; faces when they see the lights go out as their hope went out too.&nbsp; Plus you can&rsquo;t tell me that in-unverse the Northerners wanted to get rid of the Dothraki.&nbsp; They already got their own equalivent of Dothrakis called the Ironborns, they don&rsquo;t want Ironborns 2.0, the land version.</p><p>I get wanting Jon to waste the Night King because it was built up over 7 seasons, but I wasn&rsquo;t upset he didn&rsquo;t because I wasn&rsquo;t obsessed with the size of Jon Snow&rsquo;s *cough* fate.&nbsp; The Night King doesn&rsquo;t exist in the books, he was the show&rsquo;s invention as a plot device to develop Jon&rsquo;s character, forcing him to grow, fight, and think outside the ice box.&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Jon didn&rsquo;t kill the Night King&rdquo; should not be conflated with &ldquo;Jon accomplished nothing&rdquo;.&nbsp; &nbsp;Jon warned Westeros about the ice zombies and formed alliances among enemy houses to stop the apocalypse.&nbsp; Jon mined the dragonglass so everybody, including Ayra, had weapons and it was the only reason the entire castle wasn&rsquo;t mown down\n\n.&nbsp; Without Jon, Winterfell would have fallen to the Night King who then would have marched on to rest of Westeros and wiped out the human race. &nbsp;Jon correctly guessed that by killing NK his armies will die with him and that&rsquo;s why he flew around looking for the NK and dislodged him off of Viserion.&nbsp; Once on the ground the Night King was surrounded by an infinite army of zombies so Jon was not ever going to fight your way to him, and he&rsquo;s never going to duel Jon Snow for any reason other than plot-induced stupidity.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nHow do you kill someone with infinite bodyguards? A badass assassin.&nbsp; Who&rsquo;s the most badass assassin we know? Arya Stark.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Before I get to that, lets look at the&nbsp;storytelling, I liked how they cut from the scene with Arya finding her renewed purpose to a long stretch of other activity, including Jon fighting desperately to get back and defend Bran, Jorah and Daenerys&rsquo; last stand, and Theon making his brave but stupid charge at the Night King.&nbsp; It all was so pitched and emotional, and went on just long enough that I completely <i>forgot </i>about Arya, so when she came leaping out of the darkness, I had a true<b> &ldquo;holy shit!&rdquo;</b> moment like I hadn&rsquo;t had before on the show.&nbsp;</p><p>While I think the writers had the right idea with Arya being the Night King&rsquo;s assassin, they didn&rsquo;t do a good job pulling it off because she jumped out of literally no where, in a open clearing, completely surrounded by the Night King&rsquo;s infinite bodyguards.&nbsp; I think they should have had Jon Snow kills Viserion rather than yelling at him, then he gets to the the godswood and get stopped by the zombie army surrounding the NK, so Jon draws the attention of the White Walkers and wights as he attempts to fight his way through them. Then Arya takes the opportunity to sneak in and assassinate. Jon Snow gets to be a badass, and Arya still gets to do the role she was meant for, hopefully with less people whining about it.&nbsp; &nbsp;Either way, I can ignore the bad execution because they at least choose the best person for the job when it comes to defeating the Night King.

She had prayed and begged and prayed some more that he had just seemed dead, but wasn\u2019t.</p><p>But he was. The smug smile he used to wear was gone. The glimmer in his eyes had completely died out.

Maybe he had simply been stuck in the in between. Maybe he had never really seen what was waiting for him after death.</p><p>Sansa hoped so. Because that meant that her father and mother, her brothers and everyone else she had lost were waiting for her somewhere. It meant Robb was waiting for Theon.</p><p>\u201cRobb?\u201d Sansa looked at the face of the weirwood tree. \u201cRobb, please\u2026\u201d Her tears were now falling on Theon\u2019s face.

He made mistakes, but he\u2019s a good man.\u201d She kissed his slightly parted lips. \u201cEmbrace him and hold him and tell him I loved him.\u201d</p><p>Maybe if things had been different. Maybe if Robbert Baratheon had never showed up to make her father his hand. Maybe if she had not been stupidly infatuated with Joffrey. She and Theon could have had a future together, a happily ever after, their own little home and family not too far away from Winterfell.</p><p>\u201cSansa\u2026\u201d Jon placed a hand on her shoulder, but Sansa shrugged it off.</p><p>\u201cLeave me alone!\u201d She raised her voice and tightened her grip on Theon to lift him up. She pressed his body to her chest. \u201cJust leave me alone for a little longer.\u201d</p><p>Jon sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s not over yet\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d Sansa screamed. \u201cI know better than anyone.\u201d </p><p>Everyone seemed to think they had won the big war. Everyone seemed that think that after this taking on Cersei was going to be easy. And everyone was underestimating the queen who currently ruled Westeros. </p><p>Everyone but Sansa.</p><p>\u201cJust a few more minutes.\u201d She rocked Theon back and forth in her shaking arms. \u201cI just want to be this girl who lost the boy she loves for a few more minutes.\u201d Her shoulders shook. \u201cAnd then I\u2019ll go back to being the lady of Winterfell.\u201d</p><p>Jon didn\u2019t answer, but he stepped back, away from the Godswood, away from Sansa and Theon.</p><p>Sansa knew what pain felt like. She had witnessed her father being killed. She had heard the horrible stories about the falsely rumoured deaths of her brothers. It sometimes even felt as if she had been there, at the gruesome murder of Robb and her mother. </p><p>But there was no getting used to feeling that hole in your chest where your heart used to be. And once again her heart was ripped out and shred to pieces.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good man, Theon.\u201d She kissed him once last time. \u201cThank you.\u201c</p></p>",

There home is called Winterfell which could be named after there greatest fet. It&rsquo;s also the first stronghold the Night King would/does run into(besides Castle Black). They chose to be in the north to help defend the world. There motto &ldquo;Winter is coming&rdquo; a warning about the Night King passed down from generation to generation. </p><p>3. Only a Stark can defeat the Night King. &ldquo;There must always be a Stark in Winterfell&rdquo; besides being their home they never truly explain why&hellip; this also explains why SPOILER ALERT Arya kills him instead of Jon Snow or someone else. The Night King is fascinated by Jon Snow because he is both Targaryen and a Stark. Arya is a true Stark and the only one left with training to be able to do it. Bran being both crippled and the Three-eyeed Raven, Sansa being a more political figure then fighter. </p><p>Any thoughts?</p></p>",

I'm a frustrated actress/director that never got out in the world to make much of myself so I direct movies in my head and am over dramatic with everything else. I love Star Wars, LOTR, American Football, and way too many other random things to list here. Drop me a line I'm up for that.",
