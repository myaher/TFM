Arya is 18, Jaqen is 26.</p><p>The window opened and he saw her, looking lovelier than ever and&hellip; wearing nothing at all.</p><p>Jaqen averted his eyes.</p><p><i>Don&rsquo;t expose yourself like that, sweet girl. Not to this wicked world. Not to me.</i></p><!-- more --><p>Staring at the empty wall in his own apartment didn&rsquo;t help. He closed his eyes but the image of Arya Stark standing naked in a pool of morning sunlight wouldn&rsquo;t vanish. Everything was lovely about her. Her budding breasts and berry lips, her big grey eyes, her messy, chestnut hair. The way she lifted one foot and scratched the other.

I wanted to give as many people as possible time to see the original post. So it seems like many are down to do the &#129505; S<b>POOKY &#128420; SECRET &#129505; PUMPKIN &#128420; EXCHANGE &#129505;!!!</b> Yay!! I know last Christmas&rsquo; Secret Santa was a lot of fun so I&rsquo;m sure you lovely, wonderful people will bring that same energy to this Halloween event for everyone&rsquo;s favorite ASOIAF/GOT pairing (whether it&rsquo;s romantic or familial)! The gift can range from fanfics to art to gif sets to music playlists or whatever your imagination can come up with. </p><p>The exchange will take place from OCTOBER 30TH (All Hallow&rsquo;s Eve) to NOVEMBER 1ST (Dia de Los Muertos). It&rsquo;s open to anyone who wishes to participate. The only &ldquo;rules&rdquo; are that the &ldquo;gift&rdquo; be centered around Jon Snow/Arya Stark and have a theme fitting for Halloween or the fall season. </p><p>Below is everyone who showed interest on the first post. I&rsquo;m tagging you all to double check that you are wanting to participate. Please let me know by either leaving a comment on this post, reblogging for confirmation, a direct message to me. If you are not listed below you can still participate, just leave a confirmation. </p><p>The deadline to confirm participation is SEPTEMBER 30TH. You will be assigned an exchange partner no later than OCTOBER 2ND. </p><p>Now to make sure everyone hopefully gets something they like, you can create a wishlist of what you might like to receive (eg~ jonrya as kids, trick or treating, horror story, tim burton crossovers, etc&hellip; have fun with it). Of course, the wishlists aren&rsquo;t requirements but a suggestion to help your Spooky Secret Pumpkin figure out what you like. There&rsquo;s no set deadline for the wishlists, but try to have them submitted by OCTOBER 7TH so your S.S.P. has time to work on your gift.
