I'm a JONSA(jon/sansa) shipper. I'm a firm supporter of \"SHIP AND LET SHIP\" and \"LET'S AGREE TO DISAGREE\"\nI have no problem with people who ship them with others or who are multi shippers. But be warned that I post a lot of Jonsa content. O and I dislike Daenerys Targaryen(can't stand all the burning stuff up and the entitlement) So don't follow if you don't agree.\nMy OTHER favorite shows and otps are Jamestown, Merlin, Grimm, SilverMadi (BlackSails) Klayley (The Originals), Olicity (Arrow), Darvey (Suits) and Kennash(Reign, this ship broke my heart, my headcanon is that he is alive and ends up with her where ever she is)",

Like it could go on a long time. Firstly, since I started with the show, she was just clearly the pretty, young feminine princess type character..which is just like, boom, ok, that one, that one is my favourite. Every show I watch, I\u2019ve always liked the real GIRL girl character.

Now even as an adult, I\u2019m still the same. I love prettiness and girliness and all that. I also love bratty/spoilt sweet characters. I\u2019ve always said Sansa is like the cher horowitz of westoros and I stand by that statement.

There could very well be more than one inspiration behind Sansa\u2019s name but there exists a Sansa apple, which I have heard kind of tastes like Royal Gala apples, but I have never eaten one, so cannot tell (never seen one here in England either).</p><p>Plus it is apple-picking season, so why not!!!</p><p>Anyways, talking about apples, reminded me of this picture from that old Time magazine photo shoot that some of the GOT cast did a while back.</p><p>Here is Sophie Turner with a green apple (and she appears to have taken a bite off) in her hand and while others in the fandom have dissected the many meanings of this, here is what I found while I was re-reading <b>A Storm of Swords</b>. (if others have also talked about this, then oh well, another drop of water to the ocean and all that then) Part I will talk about Sansa\u2019s connections to apples and Part II will feature Jon\u2019s connections to apples.

However, there is plenty of parallels between the two.)</p><p><b><i>Lady Graceford is described to be pale and elegant, words that are often used to describe Sansa.</i></b></p><p><i>This Lady Alyce Graceford shows up again later in ASOS&hellip;during Joffrey\u2019s wedding.\u00a0</i>Tyrion and Sansa are sitting next to Ser Garlan Tyrell and Lady Leonette Fossoway at Joffrey\u2019s wedding and Tyrion wonders this about Sansa&hellip;</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cDoes she wish it were her in Margaery\u2019s place?\u201d Tyrion frowned.

The third table may be alluding to Jon being the third child of Rhaegar. Sitting on the left side to Joffrey who is king and newly married so gets the highest seat of honor, also denotes the place where the queen resides. Joffrey is a foil to Jon.

Her beauty in Tyrion VIII ASOS is described to be delicate, and kind of sounds similar to elegant and beautiful, all things that aptly describe Sansa.</p><p>But think how sweet and romantic this pair is, where the husband is feeding her morsels off his plate and they are drinking from the same cup\u2026huh where have we seen that before????</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1440\" data-orig-height=\"900\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8ae090bc94ad8679a3bd9de2f5ae352f/tumblr_inline_pg1wjxvyU71s6u549_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1440\" data-orig-height=\"900\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"1440\" data-orig-height=\"900\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fe8bbf17b200ecd2765eecb578b5a7d3/tumblr_inline_pg1wk82HM91s6u549_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1440\" data-orig-height=\"900\"></figure><p>YUP!!

It was thrice the size of the next largest he\u2019d seen, and he could hear music drifting from within. Like many of the lesser tents, it was made of sewn hides with the fur still on, but Mance Rayder\u2019s hides were the shaggy <b>white pelts of snow bears</b>.</i></p><p><i>Jon I, ASOS</i></p></blockquote><p>Jon Snow is the snow bear and the rightful King of the 7Ks.

Lady Graceford also sits on the left of King Joffrey, who is a Jon foil, in Tyrion VIII, ASOS, the place usually occupied by the queen.</b></p><p>I like this subtext very much.</p><p>Also, Mance Rayder\u2019s physical description also has echoes of Jon\u2019s physique in it.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201c<b>The King-beyond-the-Wall looked nothing like a king, nor even much a wildling</b>. He was of <b>middling height, slender, sharp-faced, with shrewd brown eyes and long brown hair that had gone mostly to grey. </b>There was <b>no crown on his head, no gold rings on his arms, no jewels at his throat, not even a gleam of silver. He wore wool and leather, and his only garment of note was his ragged black wool cloak, its long tears patched with faded red silk.</b></i><i><b>\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>-Jon I, ASOS</i></p></blockquote><p>Jon is of middling height, slender and graceful and quick with eyes that hardly miss a thing. The black wool cloak patched with faded red silk is an obvious nod to the red and black colors of House Targaryen and thus to Jon. Hair gone mostly to grey is a node to the grey colors of House Stark. Again a nod to Jon, who is of the House Stark. The Black also denotes Jon and him being the black bastard of the Wall as part of the Night\u2019s Watch. The\u00a0\u201cnor even much a wildling\u201d may allude to Jon trying to infiltrate the wildlings and pretending to become a wildling in the process. However, he neither looks like one nor does he ends up becoming one.</p><p><i><b>Since all is subtext, I think this right here is actually meant to describe Jon and not Mance. The title of the King-beyond-the-Wall is such a clever way of calling Jon, the King, because if you think about it, when you are actually in the far North, past the Wall, and you are looking south, anything South of the Wall, can also be described\u00a0as beyond the wall.\u00a0And who is the rightful King of this side (Southern side) of the wall? Jon Snow of Houses Targaryen and Stark.\u00a0</b></i></p><p>Moving on, in this Jon I ASOS chapter, we first get to listen to the song The Dornishman\u2019s Wife, and that is being sung by\u00a0<b><i>\u201ca grey-haired man in a tattered cloak of black and red sat cross-legged on a pillow, playing a lute and singing..\u201d</i></b></p><p>The grey-haired man in a cloak of black and red is another nod to Jon of the Houses Stark and Targaryen, who is also a Dornishman. A Dornishman\u2019s wife can also be called a Dornishwoman. In fact, one of the only two times the word <b>\u201cDornishwoman\u201d</b> shows up in the text in a POV chapter in ASOIAF, is in a Sansa chapter, <b>Sansa IV, ASOS</b>, talking about Ellaria Sand, paramour to the Red Viper of Dorne, Prince Oberyn. The other time is in the epilogue of ADWD.</p><p>Anyways, I think, there exists many subtextual clues that connect Jon and Sansa <i>via </i>apples or rather House Fossoway and may foreshadow them marrying and becoming King and Queen of the 7Ks and having a baby (or babies)!!! Here\u2019s to at least some of that in S8!</p><p>(I am a quarter way through ASOS, and hopefully, if I can find any more apple connections, I will add on to this post. If others find some, would love to read about them. One thing that always strikes me is the sheer number of parallels that exist between Sansa I and Jon I chapters in ASOS, later chapters of these two also have quite a lot of clues).\u00a0<br></p>",
                "content": "<p>I saw people posting about Sansa&rsquo;s name and what it means on Tumblr yesterday and decided to post this bit about Sansa and apples and her connection to Jon.
