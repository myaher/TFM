Despite its small size, it was nice and homey, and Cyrus absolutely loved his time there (though maybe it was the person he was spending the time with).</p><p>\u201cT.J.,\u201d Cyrus begins, his voice uneven and unable to look away from T.J.\u2019s stunning green eyes.</p><p>T.J. inhales deeply as he takes a step towards the nervous boy in front of him. He can\u2019t help but notice how adorable his chocolate-brown eyes look all wide in his current panicked state.</p><p>\u201cCyrus,\u201d TJ begins, his heart pounding in his chest, \u201cI want\u2014\u201c</p><p>Suddenly, the front door swings open. They jump apart from each other, and Cyrus quickly finds his shoes very intriguing.</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cDad,\u201d TJ nearly shouts as a deep blush makes its way onto his cheeks, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to be home so early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got off early, so I thought I should come home and make dinner. We can order Chinese another night,\u201d his Dad replies. T.J. is deep in thought trying to break down what he thought was about to happen. He barely grasps what his father tells him and opts to nod nondescriptly and hope he won\u2019t become suspicious.</p><p>In the awkward silence, Cyrus steps forward and holds out his hand, \u201cI\u2019m Cyrus. It\u2019s nice to meet you Mr. Kippen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you too,\u201d he says, giving the boy a firm handshake that nearly dislocates Cyrus\u2019s arm. \u201cTJ has told me so much about you.\u201d</p><p>T.J.\u2019s face heats up even more, his blush deepening. \u201cUh, Cyrus,\u201d he begins, now a stuttering, blushing mess, \u201cWell, he was just about to leave.\u201d</p><p>T.J. puts a hand on Cyrus\u2019s back to steer him towards the door.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay for dinner?\u201d His Dad asks. T.J. begins to panic. No way can he get through the awkwardness that is bound to ensue. Before T.J. can protest, Cyrus is nodding enthusiastically with an adorable, puppy-like smile on his face. T.J. can\u2019t say no to that face.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Thirty minutes later, T.J., his dad, and Cyrus sit around the Kippen\u2019s kitchen table in silence apart from the forks scraping up the spaghetti and meatballs from the bowls in front of them. T.J. can\u2019t help but steal glances at the dark haired Jewish boy across from him. Despite the awkwardness, he loves the domesticity of it and smiles at the idea that this could be a normal occurrence if the boy likes him back. Cyrus and him sitting around a dinner table with a home cooked meal.</p><p>\u201cSo Cyrus,\u201d Mr. Kippen finally says, \u201cDo you have any plans for the holidays?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I celebrate Hanukkah which starts on Sunday,\u201d Cyrus answers excitedly. \u201cIt\u2019s always a busy time because I have two sets of parents, so I spend the eight days hopping around between houses.\u201d</p><p>T.J. admires how Cyrus\u2019s eyes light up when he talks about the holidays, and he can\u2019t help but smile at the dorky boy.</p><p>\u201cAh, so you\u2019re Jewish?\u201d T.J.\u2019s dad asks, \u201cAll four parents?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus nods and adds, \u201cAlso, all four are therapists.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Kippen raises his eyebrows in surprise, \u201cWow that is a lot of mental health professionals! Must get overwhelming!\u201d</p><p>Cyrus laughs and nods sardonically as he looks down at his plate. T.J. slyly puts a hand on his knee comfortingly, noticing his discomfort with the subject. Their eyes lock for a brief second, and T.J. has to look away to keep himself from blushing.</p><p>\u201cSo T.J. hasn\u2019t told me much about any holiday plans,\u201d Cyrus says, desperately filling the silence and steering the conversation away from his overbearing parents. \u201cWhat do you guys do for the holidays?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, this year T.J.\u2019s sister and I have to work on Christmas morning, so I guess we don\u2019t really have anything planned,\u201d Mr. Kippen says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that,\u201d Cyrus says soothingly.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really feel like a holiday when it\u2019s just the immediate family anyway,\u201d T.J. bitterly states.</p><p>At this, Mr. Kippen seems to get mad. \u201cDo you want to spend Christmas with your homophobic grandparents?\u201d he scorns.</p><p>T.J. shakes his head, unable to make eye contact with his dad. Mr. Kippen takes a deep breath and lets out the tension in his body. It is clearly evident where T.J. gets his somewhat fiery temper from, but his dad is much better at handling it. Cyrus notices that T.J. is still silently fuming, and he becomes desperate to fill the silence before the other boy has an outburst.</p><p>\u201cI usually spend Christmas Day at my friend Andi\u2019s,\u201d Cyrus explains, \u201cBut long story short she kind of just met her dad so this is their first Christmas as a happy family and I didn\u2019t want to intrude on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t be intruding,\u201d Mr. Kippen assures him. \u201cAny family would be lucky to have you for the holidays.\u201d</p><p>The second part is said directly towards T.J. who has released his anger and seemed to shift all the way in the direction of flustered. He and his dad have a silent conversation with their eyes as T.J. begins to blush. He finally looks away, stands up from the table, and announces that they are going up to his room. Cyrus follows him out of the kitchen and up the stairs.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>T.J. walks briskly through the door of his bedroom and sits heavily on his unmade bed as Cyrus quietly shuts the door behind him. The jock falls onto his back and covers his face for the pillow.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Cyrus asks timidly.</p><p>T.J. doesn\u2019t answer, so Cyrus begins to examine the room around him. T.J.\u2019s room is exactly what you\u2019d expect out of a teenage boy. The walls are painted baby blue and there is a toy basketball hoop on the back of his door. The room is small, and the floor is littered with basketball shorts and brightly colored hoodies making it seem much smaller than it already is. There are a couple of trophies and baby pictures placed on shelves that clearly haven\u2019t been dusted in the last five years. After a bit, Cyrus returns his attention to T.J. who has not moved from his position on the bed. For once, Cyrus doesn\u2019t know how to comfort the boy, but he hopes that just being in the room with him will calm him down enough to talk. Eventually, T.J. pulls the pillow away from his face and sits up groggily. His eyes are tinged red, clearly from trying to hold back his tears.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me anything,\u201d Cyrus says comfortingly, \u201cBut I\u2019m here to help if you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry it\u2019s just\u2014sometimes when you talk about your family it just makes me realize that I don\u2019t really have one,\u201d T.J. explains barely keeping his composure.</p><p>\u201cYou have a dad and a sister,\u201d Cyrus offers, \u201cThat\u2019s all the family you need.\u201d</p><p>T.J. takes in Cyrus\u2019s words with his eyes on his hands. \u201cYeah, I guess,\u201d he contemplates, \u201cMy mom passed away a few years ago, my dad doesn\u2019t have any siblings, and we stopped seeing my grandparents, ever since my sister came out to them so it\u2019s really just us three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear about all that,\u201d Cyrus says placing a soothing hand on T.J.\u2019s, \u201cWhat exactly happened with your grandparents, if it\u2019s not too much to ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen my sister came out to us, it was about two years ago. My dad sat me down and said \u2018I want you to know that what your sister is feeling right now is completely normal and completely healthy, and I won\u2019t tolerate anyone who tells her otherwise\u2019,\u201d T.J. recites his father\u2019s words like he had just heard them yesterday. \u201cI remember it vividly because I was just starting to seriously question my identity. I think that\u2019s when I knew that I would be okay no matter what, but it was still really difficult for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that,\u201d Cyrus comments, thinking back to his own experience. Despite all the support he got from Buffy, he was still petrified when it came to admitting it to others. He hadn\u2019t even told his parents yet, even though he was sure they have their suspicions already.</p><p>\u201cThe next year,\u201d T.J. continues, \u201cmy sister came out to our grandparents, and they were not accepting at all. So my dad got in a fight with them, and\u2026we haven\u2019t seen them since. His own parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re better off without them,\u201d Cyrus assures him.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d T.J. says, \u201cIt just sucks to know that my own grandparents wouldn\u2019t be proud of who I am. Even though I am.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus offers a small smile to the boy and says, \u201cI\u2019m proud of who you are.\u201d</p><p>T.J. can\u2019t help but blush and look away bashfully at the compliment. Cyrus is the most caring person he knows, so Cyrus being proud of the person T.J. is has to mean something.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>After cooling down, T.J. heads downstairs to send Cyrus off. T.J. watches as Cyrus slides on his sneakers by the front door, a silence hanging over them that\u2019s uncharacteristic for their friendship.</p><p>\u201cSorry if that was awkward,\u201d T.J. says in a desperate attempt to release the tension.</p><p>\u201cNo, I had fun,\u201d Cyrus assures him. \u201cThanks for having me Mr. Kippen!\u201d</p><p>His dad yells \u2018anytime\u2019 from his place in the kitchen as Cyrus zips up his jacket. He casts a signature Cyrus smile at T.J. and turns to open the door.</p><p>\u201cCy,\u201d T.J. whispers, stopping Cyrus in his tracks. Cyrus turns around and looks up at the jock who once again can\u2019t bring himself to say what he feels. He settles for, \u201cI\u2019m really glad you\u2019re my friend.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus smiles his cutest smile and steps forward. He wraps his arms around TJ\u2019s neck, pulling him into a hug. After a brief moment of shock at the physical intimacy, TJ\u2019s arms find their way around the smaller boy\u2019s waist. He feels as if his heart is about to leap out of his chest. He\u2019s hugging Cyrus! The cutest of all cute boys has his chin resting on his shoulder! He never wants to pull away, but Cyrus reluctantly does after a few too many blissful seconds to be considered just friendly.</p><p>Cyrus\u2019s face is painted with a shy smile as he says, \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re my friend too. See ya tomorrow.\u201d His eyes cast a final glance towards TJ wearing a dopey grin as he disappears through the front door, leaving TJ in a dream-like state.</p><p>\u201cCyrus is nice,\u201d T.J.\u2019s Dad says, snapping him out of his haze. T.J. looks to his dad standing by the island in the kitchen, who witnessed the entire encounter. He has a knowing grin plastered across his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d T.J. asks, maybe a bit too defensively.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he replies. \u201cIt\u2019s just good to see you happy after what happened at dinner. And happier in general.\u201d</p><p>T.J. just nods and smiles to himself, as he walks over to the sink and begins rinsing off the plates from that night\u2019s meal of spaghetti and meatballs. He\u2019s pretty sure he knows what his dad is trying to get at, but he doesn\u2019t want to confirm anything.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSon, I know I\u2019m not always able to be here for you,\u201d his dad begins, \u201cBut you should know there\u2019s nothing you can\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about\u201d T.J. lies. He tries to speed up his kitchen cleaning duties, suddenly feeling an impulse to get out of the conversation as soon as humanly possible.</p><p>\u201cLet me just say this,\u201d his dad begins. \u201cI really like Cyrus. And I love you, no matter what. Understand?\u201d</p><p>T.J. nods slowly in contemplation of if he should tell his dad the truth or keep perpetuating his poorly constructed lie. He knows his father can see right through him, but he won\u2019t push too hard if T.J. seems uncomfortable. Making a decision, T.J. turns off the faucet and lets out a shake exhale.</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d T.J. whispers, his voice small and nervous, \u201cI like Cyrus.

They jump apart from each other, and Cyrus quickly finds his shoes very intriguing.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cDad,\u201d TJ nearly shouts as a deep blush makes its way onto his cheeks, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to be home so early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got off early, so I thought I should come home and make dinner. We can order Chinese another night,\u201d his Dad replies. T.J. is deep in thought trying to break down what he thought was about to happen. He barely grasps what his father tells him and opts to nod nondescriptly and hope he won\u2019t become suspicious.</p><p>In the awkward silence, Cyrus steps forward and holds out his hand, \u201cI\u2019m Cyrus. It\u2019s nice to meet you Mr. Kippen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you too,\u201d he says, giving the boy a firm handshake that nearly dislocates Cyrus\u2019s arm. \u201cTJ has told me so much about you.\u201d</p><p>T.J.\u2019s face heats up even more, his blush deepening. \u201cUh, Cyrus,\u201d he begins, now a stuttering, blushing mess, \u201cWell, he was just about to leave.\u201d</p><p>T.J. puts a hand on Cyrus\u2019s back to steer him towards the door.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay for dinner?\u201d His Dad asks. T.J. begins to panic. No way can he get through the awkwardness that is bound to ensue. Before T.J. can protest, Cyrus is nodding enthusiastically with an adorable, puppy-like smile on his face. T.J. can\u2019t say no to that face.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Thirty minutes later, T.J., his dad, and Cyrus sit around the Kippen\u2019s kitchen table in silence apart from the forks scraping up the spaghetti and meatballs from the bowls in front of them. T.J. can\u2019t help but steal glances at the dark haired Jewish boy across from him. Despite the awkwardness, he loves the domesticity of it and smiles at the idea that this could be a normal occurrence if the boy likes him back. Cyrus and him sitting around a dinner table with a home cooked meal.</p><p>\u201cSo Cyrus,\u201d Mr. Kippen finally says, \u201cDo you have any plans for the holidays?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I celebrate Hanukkah which starts on Sunday,\u201d Cyrus answers excitedly. \u201cIt\u2019s always a busy time because I have two sets of parents, so I spend the eight days hopping around between houses.\u201d</p><p>T.J. admires how Cyrus\u2019s eyes light up when he talks about the holidays, and he can\u2019t help but smile at the dorky boy.</p><p>\u201cAh, so you\u2019re Jewish?\u201d T.J.\u2019s dad asks, \u201cAll four parents?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus nods and adds, \u201cAlso, all four are therapists.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Kippen raises his eyebrows in surprise, \u201cWow that is a lot of mental health professionals! Must get overwhelming!\u201d</p><p>Cyrus laughs and nods sardonically as he looks down at his plate. T.J. slyly puts a hand on his knee comfortingly, noticing his discomfort with the subject. Their eyes lock for a brief second, and T.J. has to look away to keep himself from blushing.</p><p>\u201cSo T.J. hasn\u2019t told me much about any holiday plans,\u201d Cyrus says, desperately filling the silence and steering the conversation away from his overbearing parents. \u201cWhat do you guys do for the holidays?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, this year T.J.\u2019s sister and I have to work on Christmas morning, so I guess we don\u2019t really have anything planned,\u201d Mr. Kippen says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that,\u201d Cyrus says soothingly.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really feel like a holiday when it\u2019s just the immediate family anyway,\u201d T.J. bitterly states.</p><p>At this, Mr. Kippen seems to get mad. \u201cDo you want to spend Christmas with your homophobic grandparents?\u201d he scorns.</p><p>T.J. shakes his head, unable to make eye contact with his dad. Mr. Kippen takes a deep breath and lets out the tension in his body. It is clearly evident where T.J. gets his somewhat fiery temper from, but his dad is much better at handling it. Cyrus notices that T.J. is still silently fuming, and he becomes desperate to fill the silence before the other boy has an outburst.</p><p>\u201cI usually spend Christmas Day at my friend Andi\u2019s,\u201d Cyrus explains, \u201cBut long story short she kind of just met her dad so this is their first Christmas as a happy family and I didn\u2019t want to intrude on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t be intruding,\u201d Mr. Kippen assures him. \u201cAny family would be lucky to have you for the holidays.\u201d</p><p>The second part is said directly towards T.J. who has released his anger and seemed to shift all the way in the direction of flustered. He and his dad have a silent conversation with their eyes as T.J. begins to blush. He finally looks away, stands up from the table, and announces that they are going up to his room. Cyrus follows him out of the kitchen and up the stairs.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>T.J. walks briskly through the door of his bedroom and sits heavily on his unmade bed as Cyrus quietly shuts the door behind him. The jock falls onto his back and covers his face for the pillow.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Cyrus asks timidly.</p><p>T.J. doesn\u2019t answer, so Cyrus begins to examine the room around him. T.J.\u2019s room is exactly what you\u2019d expect out of a teenage boy. The walls are painted baby blue and there is a toy basketball hoop on the back of his door. The room is small, and the floor is littered with basketball shorts and brightly colored hoodies making it seem much smaller than it already is. There are a couple of trophies and baby pictures placed on shelves that clearly haven\u2019t been dusted in the last five years. After a bit, Cyrus returns his attention to T.J. who has not moved from his position on the bed. For once, Cyrus doesn\u2019t know how to comfort the boy, but he hopes that just being in the room with him will calm him down enough to talk. Eventually, T.J. pulls the pillow away from his face and sits up groggily. His eyes are tinged red, clearly from trying to hold back his tears.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me anything,\u201d Cyrus says comfortingly, \u201cBut I\u2019m here to help if you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry it\u2019s just\u2014sometimes when you talk about your family it just makes me realize that I don\u2019t really have one,\u201d T.J. explains barely keeping his composure.</p><p>\u201cYou have a dad and a sister,\u201d Cyrus offers, \u201cThat\u2019s all the family you need.\u201d</p><p>T.J. takes in Cyrus\u2019s words with his eyes on his hands. \u201cYeah, I guess,\u201d he contemplates, \u201cMy mom passed away a few years ago, my dad doesn\u2019t have any siblings, and we stopped seeing my grandparents, ever since my sister came out to them so it\u2019s really just us three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear about all that,\u201d Cyrus says placing a soothing hand on T.J.\u2019s, \u201cWhat exactly happened with your grandparents, if it\u2019s not too much to ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen my sister came out to us, it was about two years ago. My dad sat me down and said \u2018I want you to know that what your sister is feeling right now is completely normal and completely healthy, and I won\u2019t tolerate anyone who tells her otherwise\u2019,\u201d T.J. recites his father\u2019s words like he had just heard them yesterday. \u201cI remember it vividly because I was just starting to seriously question my identity. I think that\u2019s when I knew that I would be okay no matter what, but it was still really difficult for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that,\u201d Cyrus comments, thinking back to his own experience. Despite all the support he got from Buffy, he was still petrified when it came to admitting it to others. He hadn\u2019t even told his parents yet, even though he was sure they have their suspicions already.</p><p>\u201cThe next year,\u201d T.J. continues, \u201cmy sister came out to our grandparents, and they were not accepting at all. So my dad got in a fight with them, and\u2026we haven\u2019t seen them since. His own parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re better off without them,\u201d Cyrus assures him.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d T.J. says, \u201cIt just sucks to know that my own grandparents wouldn\u2019t be proud of who I am. Even though I am.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus offers a small smile to the boy and says, \u201cI\u2019m proud of who you are.\u201d</p><p>T.J. can\u2019t help but blush and look away bashfully at the compliment. Cyrus is the most caring person he knows, so Cyrus being proud of the person T.J. is has to mean something.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>After cooling down, T.J. heads downstairs to send Cyrus off. T.J. watches as Cyrus slides on his sneakers by the front door, a silence hanging over them that\u2019s uncharacteristic for their friendship.</p><p>\u201cSorry if that was awkward,\u201d T.J. says in a desperate attempt to release the tension.</p><p>\u201cNo, I had fun,\u201d Cyrus assures him. \u201cThanks for having me Mr. Kippen!\u201d</p><p>His dad yells \u2018anytime\u2019 from his place in the kitchen as Cyrus zips up his jacket. He casts a signature Cyrus smile at T.J. and turns to open the door.</p><p>\u201cCy,\u201d T.J. whispers, stopping Cyrus in his tracks. Cyrus turns around and looks up at the jock who once again can\u2019t bring himself to say what he feels. He settles for, \u201cI\u2019m really glad you\u2019re my friend.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus smiles his cutest smile and steps forward. He wraps his arms around TJ\u2019s neck, pulling him into a hug. After a brief moment of shock at the physical intimacy, TJ\u2019s arms find their way around the smaller boy\u2019s waist. He feels as if his heart is about to leap out of his chest. He\u2019s hugging Cyrus! The cutest of all cute boys has his chin resting on his shoulder! He never wants to pull away, but Cyrus reluctantly does after a few too many blissful seconds to be considered just friendly.</p><p>Cyrus\u2019s face is painted with a shy smile as he says, \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re my friend too. See ya tomorrow.\u201d His eyes cast a final glance towards TJ wearing a dopey grin as he disappears through the front door, leaving TJ in a dream-like state.</p><p>\u201cCyrus is nice,\u201d T.J.\u2019s Dad says, snapping him out of his haze. T.J. looks to his dad standing by the island in the kitchen, who witnessed the entire encounter. He has a knowing grin plastered across his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d T.J. asks, maybe a bit too defensively.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he replies. \u201cIt\u2019s just good to see you happy after what happened at dinner. And happier in general.\u201d</p><p>T.J. just nods and smiles to himself, as he walks over to the sink and begins rinsing off the plates from that night\u2019s meal of spaghetti and meatballs. He\u2019s pretty sure he knows what his dad is trying to get at, but he doesn\u2019t want to confirm anything.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSon, I know I\u2019m not always able to be here for you,\u201d his dad begins, \u201cBut you should know there\u2019s nothing you can\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about\u201d T.J. lies. He tries to speed up his kitchen cleaning duties, suddenly feeling an impulse to get out of the conversation as soon as humanly possible.</p><p>\u201cLet me just say this,\u201d his dad begins. \u201cI really like Cyrus. And I love you, no matter what. Understand?\u201d</p><p>T.J. nods slowly in contemplation of if he should tell his dad the truth or keep perpetuating his poorly constructed lie. He knows his father can see right through him, but he won\u2019t push too hard if T.J. seems uncomfortable. Making a decision, T.J. turns off the faucet and lets out a shake exhale.</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d T.J. whispers, his voice small and nervous, \u201cI like Cyrus. I\u2019m gay.\u201d</p><p>Without hesitating, his father wraps his arms around T.J., his son melting into the embrace. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of you, son,\u201d his dad assures him. \u201cI love you exactly the way you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel about both of us being gay?\u201d T.J. asks somewhat jokingly.</p><p>\u201cI love you both just as much!\u201d His dad assures him, \u201cBut I guess the bloodline ends with you two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess it does,\u201d T.J. laughs.</p><p>After a bit, T.J.\u2019s dad says, \u201cFor the record, I think Cyrus feels the same way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I should tell him?\u201d T.J. asks nervously.</p><p>\u201cYeah.

He barely grasps what his father tells him and opts to nod nondescriptly and hope he won\u2019t become suspicious.</p><p>In the awkward silence, Cyrus steps forward and holds out his hand, \u201cI\u2019m Cyrus. It\u2019s nice to meet you Mr. Kippen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you too,\u201d he says, giving the boy a firm handshake that nearly dislocates Cyrus\u2019s arm. \u201cTJ has told me so much about you.\u201d</p><p>T.J.\u2019s face heats up even more, his blush deepening. \u201cUh, Cyrus,\u201d he begins, now a stuttering, blushing mess, \u201cWell, he was just about to leave.\u201d</p><p>T.J. puts a hand on Cyrus\u2019s back to steer him towards the door.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay for dinner?\u201d His Dad asks. T.J. begins to panic. No way can he get through the awkwardness that is bound to ensue. Before T.J. can protest, Cyrus is nodding enthusiastically with an adorable, puppy-like smile on his face. T.J. can\u2019t say no to that face.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Thirty minutes later, T.J., his dad, and Cyrus sit around the Kippen\u2019s kitchen table in silence apart from the forks scraping up the spaghetti and meatballs from the bowls in front of them. T.J. can\u2019t help but steal glances at the dark haired Jewish boy across from him. Despite the awkwardness, he loves the domesticity of it and smiles at the idea that this could be a normal occurrence if the boy likes him back. Cyrus and him sitting around a dinner table with a home cooked meal.</p><p>\u201cSo Cyrus,\u201d Mr. Kippen finally says, \u201cDo you have any plans for the holidays?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I celebrate Hanukkah which starts on Sunday,\u201d Cyrus answers excitedly. \u201cIt\u2019s always a busy time because I have two sets of parents, so I spend the eight days hopping around between houses.\u201d</p><p>T.J. admires how Cyrus\u2019s eyes light up when he talks about the holidays, and he can\u2019t help but smile at the dorky boy.</p><p>\u201cAh, so you\u2019re Jewish?\u201d T.J.\u2019s dad asks, \u201cAll four parents?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus nods and adds, \u201cAlso, all four are therapists.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Kippen raises his eyebrows in surprise, \u201cWow that is a lot of mental health professionals! Must get overwhelming!\u201d</p><p>Cyrus laughs and nods sardonically as he looks down at his plate. T.J. slyly puts a hand on his knee comfortingly, noticing his discomfort with the subject. Their eyes lock for a brief second, and T.J. has to look away to keep himself from blushing.</p><p>\u201cSo T.J. hasn\u2019t told me much about any holiday plans,\u201d Cyrus says, desperately filling the silence and steering the conversation away from his overbearing parents. \u201cWhat do you guys do for the holidays?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, this year T.J.\u2019s sister and I have to work on Christmas morning, so I guess we don\u2019t really have anything planned,\u201d Mr. Kippen says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that,\u201d Cyrus says soothingly.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really feel like a holiday when it\u2019s just the immediate family anyway,\u201d T.J. bitterly states.</p><p>At this, Mr. Kippen seems to get mad. \u201cDo you want to spend Christmas with your homophobic grandparents?\u201d he scorns.</p><p>T.J. shakes his head, unable to make eye contact with his dad. Mr. Kippen takes a deep breath and lets out the tension in his body. It is clearly evident where T.J. gets his somewhat fiery temper from, but his dad is much better at handling it. Cyrus notices that T.J. is still silently fuming, and he becomes desperate to fill the silence before the other boy has an outburst.</p><p>\u201cI usually spend Christmas Day at my friend Andi\u2019s,\u201d Cyrus explains, \u201cBut long story short she kind of just met her dad so this is their first Christmas as a happy family and I didn\u2019t want to intrude on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t be intruding,\u201d Mr. Kippen assures him. \u201cAny family would be lucky to have you for the holidays.\u201d</p><p>The second part is said directly towards T.J. who has released his anger and seemed to shift all the way in the direction of flustered. He and his dad have a silent conversation with their eyes as T.J. begins to blush. He finally looks away, stands up from the table, and announces that they are going up to his room. Cyrus follows him out of the kitchen and up the stairs.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>T.J. walks briskly through the door of his bedroom and sits heavily on his unmade bed as Cyrus quietly shuts the door behind him. The jock falls onto his back and covers his face for the pillow.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Cyrus asks timidly.</p><p>T.J. doesn\u2019t answer, so Cyrus begins to examine the room around him. T.J.\u2019s room is exactly what you\u2019d expect out of a teenage boy. The walls are painted baby blue and there is a toy basketball hoop on the back of his door. The room is small, and the floor is littered with basketball shorts and brightly colored hoodies making it seem much smaller than it already is. There are a couple of trophies and baby pictures placed on shelves that clearly haven\u2019t been dusted in the last five years. After a bit, Cyrus returns his attention to T.J. who has not moved from his position on the bed. For once, Cyrus doesn\u2019t know how to comfort the boy, but he hopes that just being in the room with him will calm him down enough to talk. Eventually, T.J. pulls the pillow away from his face and sits up groggily. His eyes are tinged red, clearly from trying to hold back his tears.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me anything,\u201d Cyrus says comfortingly, \u201cBut I\u2019m here to help if you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry it\u2019s just\u2014sometimes when you talk about your family it just makes me realize that I don\u2019t really have one,\u201d T.J. explains barely keeping his composure.</p><p>\u201cYou have a dad and a sister,\u201d Cyrus offers, \u201cThat\u2019s all the family you need.\u201d</p><p>T.J. takes in Cyrus\u2019s words with his eyes on his hands. \u201cYeah, I guess,\u201d he contemplates, \u201cMy mom passed away a few years ago, my dad doesn\u2019t have any siblings, and we stopped seeing my grandparents, ever since my sister came out to them so it\u2019s really just us three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear about all that,\u201d Cyrus says placing a soothing hand on T.J.\u2019s, \u201cWhat exactly happened with your grandparents, if it\u2019s not too much to ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen my sister came out to us, it was about two years ago. My dad sat me down and said \u2018I want you to know that what your sister is feeling right now is completely normal and completely healthy, and I won\u2019t tolerate anyone who tells her otherwise\u2019,\u201d T.J. recites his father\u2019s words like he had just heard them yesterday. \u201cI remember it vividly because I was just starting to seriously question my identity. I think that\u2019s when I knew that I would be okay no matter what, but it was still really difficult for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that,\u201d Cyrus comments, thinking back to his own experience. Despite all the support he got from Buffy, he was still petrified when it came to admitting it to others. He hadn\u2019t even told his parents yet, even though he was sure they have their suspicions already.</p><p>\u201cThe next year,\u201d T.J. continues, \u201cmy sister came out to our grandparents, and they were not accepting at all. So my dad got in a fight with them, and\u2026we haven\u2019t seen them since. His own parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re better off without them,\u201d Cyrus assures him.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d T.J. says, \u201cIt just sucks to know that my own grandparents wouldn\u2019t be proud of who I am. Even though I am.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus offers a small smile to the boy and says, \u201cI\u2019m proud of who you are.\u201d</p><p>T.J. can\u2019t help but blush and look away bashfully at the compliment. Cyrus is the most caring person he knows, so Cyrus being proud of the person T.J. is has to mean something.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>After cooling down, T.J. heads downstairs to send Cyrus off. T.J. watches as Cyrus slides on his sneakers by the front door, a silence hanging over them that\u2019s uncharacteristic for their friendship.</p><p>\u201cSorry if that was awkward,\u201d T.J. says in a desperate attempt to release the tension.</p><p>\u201cNo, I had fun,\u201d Cyrus assures him. \u201cThanks for having me Mr. Kippen!\u201d</p><p>His dad yells \u2018anytime\u2019 from his place in the kitchen as Cyrus zips up his jacket. He casts a signature Cyrus smile at T.J. and turns to open the door.</p><p>\u201cCy,\u201d T.J. whispers, stopping Cyrus in his tracks. Cyrus turns around and looks up at the jock who once again can\u2019t bring himself to say what he feels. He settles for, \u201cI\u2019m really glad you\u2019re my friend.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus smiles his cutest smile and steps forward. He wraps his arms around TJ\u2019s neck, pulling him into a hug. After a brief moment of shock at the physical intimacy, TJ\u2019s arms find their way around the smaller boy\u2019s waist. He feels as if his heart is about to leap out of his chest. He\u2019s hugging Cyrus! The cutest of all cute boys has his chin resting on his shoulder! He never wants to pull away, but Cyrus reluctantly does after a few too many blissful seconds to be considered just friendly.</p><p>Cyrus\u2019s face is painted with a shy smile as he says, \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re my friend too. See ya tomorrow.\u201d His eyes cast a final glance towards TJ wearing a dopey grin as he disappears through the front door, leaving TJ in a dream-like state.</p><p>\u201cCyrus is nice,\u201d T.J.\u2019s Dad says, snapping him out of his haze. T.J. looks to his dad standing by the island in the kitchen, who witnessed the entire encounter. He has a knowing grin plastered across his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d T.J. asks, maybe a bit too defensively.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he replies. \u201cIt\u2019s just good to see you happy after what happened at dinner. And happier in general.\u201d</p><p>T.J. just nods and smiles to himself, as he walks over to the sink and begins rinsing off the plates from that night\u2019s meal of spaghetti and meatballs. He\u2019s pretty sure he knows what his dad is trying to get at, but he doesn\u2019t want to confirm anything.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSon, I know I\u2019m not always able to be here for you,\u201d his dad begins, \u201cBut you should know there\u2019s nothing you can\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about\u201d T.J. lies. He tries to speed up his kitchen cleaning duties, suddenly feeling an impulse to get out of the conversation as soon as humanly possible.</p><p>\u201cLet me just say this,\u201d his dad begins. \u201cI really like Cyrus. And I love you, no matter what. Understand?\u201d</p><p>T.J. nods slowly in contemplation of if he should tell his dad the truth or keep perpetuating his poorly constructed lie. He knows his father can see right through him, but he won\u2019t push too hard if T.J. seems uncomfortable. Making a decision, T.J. turns off the faucet and lets out a shake exhale.</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d T.J. whispers, his voice small and nervous, \u201cI like Cyrus. I\u2019m gay.\u201d</p><p>Without hesitating, his father wraps his arms around T.J., his son melting into the embrace. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of you, son,\u201d his dad assures him. \u201cI love you exactly the way you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel about both of us being gay?\u201d T.J. asks somewhat jokingly.</p><p>\u201cI love you both just as much!\u201d His dad assures him, \u201cBut I guess the bloodline ends with you two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess it does,\u201d T.J. laughs.</p><p>After a bit, T.J.\u2019s dad says, \u201cFor the record, I think Cyrus feels the same way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I should tell him?\u201d T.J. asks nervously.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Go get him tiger,\u201d His dad encourages with a playful push. \u201cLock that boy down. Be a man and ask that boy out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a statement you hear too often\u2026\u201d T.J. starts before he\u2019s cut off by his father again.</p><p>\u201cAnd then be the sappiest boyfriend in existence with your \u2018Cy, I\u2019m happy you\u2019re my friend\u2019,\u201d his dad teases.</p><p>\u201cUgh, you\u2019re the worst\u201d T.J. says, unable to hide the blush that creeps onto his cheeks and the dopey smile that tugs at his lips. God, he is so far gone.</p><p>\u201cI have an idea. Your sister has to work on Christmas, why don\u2019t you invite your boy over so you\u2019ll have someone to spend time with?\u201d his dad offers, a mischievous grin gracing his face, \u201cIt\u2019d be the perfect time to confess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew that was coming,\u201d T.J. says, his cheeks now burning and deep red, \u201dAnd he\u2019s Jewish. He doesn\u2019t celebrate Christmas\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect!\u201d His dad exclaims, \u201cHe won\u2019t have plans.\u201d</p><p>T.J. sighs and says, \u201cSomething tells me you aren\u2019t going to let this go.\u201d</p><p>His dad shakes his head no and engulfs his son a tight hug earning a squeal from the basketball player. For a moment, T.J. and his father are carefree and messing around as they used to in old times. T.J. no longer holds a secret from his father, and his best friend in the world knows and accepts his identity. Plus, Cyrus Goodman is gay, cute as hell, and probably the sweetest person on the planet!</p>",

He&rsquo;s pretty sure he knows what his dad is trying to get at, but he doesn&rsquo;t want to confirm anything.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Son, I know I&rsquo;m not always able to be here for you,&rdquo; his dad begins, &ldquo;But you should know there&rsquo;s nothing you can&rsquo;t tell me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about&rdquo; T.J. lies. He tries to speed up his kitchen cleaning duties, suddenly feeling an impulse to get out of the conversation as soon as humanly possible.</p><p>&ldquo;Let me just say this,&rdquo; his dad begins. &ldquo;I really like Cyrus. And I love you, no matter what. Understand?&rdquo;</p><p>T.J. nods slowly in contemplation of if he should tell his dad the truth or keep perpetuating his poorly constructed lie. He knows his father can see right through him, but he won&rsquo;t push too hard if T.J. seems uncomfortable. Making a decision, T.J. turns off the faucet and lets out a shake exhale.</p><p>&ldquo;Dad,&rdquo; T.J. whispers, his voice small and nervous, &ldquo;I like Cyrus. I&rsquo;m gay.&rdquo;</p><p>Without hesitating, his father wraps his arms around T.J., his son melting into the embrace. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so proud of you, son,&rdquo; his dad assures him. &ldquo;I love you exactly the way you are.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How do you feel about both of us being gay?&rdquo; T.J. asks somewhat jokingly.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you both just as much!&rdquo; His dad assures him, &ldquo;But I guess the bloodline ends with you two.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I guess it does,&rdquo; T.J. laughs.</p><p>After a bit, T.J.&rsquo;s dad says, &ldquo;For the record, I think Cyrus feels the same way.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You think I should tell him?&rdquo; T.J. asks nervously.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. Go get him tiger,&rdquo; His dad encourages with a playful push. &ldquo;Lock that boy down. Be a man and ask that boy out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a statement you hear too often&hellip;&rdquo; T.J. starts before he&rsquo;s cut off by his father again.</p><p>&ldquo;And then be the sappiest boyfriend in existence with your &lsquo;Cy, I&rsquo;m happy you&rsquo;re my friend&rsquo;,&rdquo; his dad teases.</p><p>&ldquo;Ugh, you&rsquo;re the worst&rdquo; T.J. says, unable to hide the blush that creeps onto his cheeks and the dopey smile that tugs at his lips. God, he is so far gone.</p><p>&ldquo;I have an idea. Your sister has to work on Christmas, why don&rsquo;t you invite your boy over so you&rsquo;ll have someone to spend time with?&rdquo; his dad offers, a mischievous grin gracing his face, &ldquo;It&rsquo;d be the perfect time to confess.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I knew that was coming,&rdquo; T.J. says, his cheeks now burning and deep red, &rdquo;And he&rsquo;s Jewish. He doesn&rsquo;t celebrate Christmas&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Perfect!&rdquo; His dad exclaims, &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t have plans.&rdquo;</p><p>T.J. sighs and says, &ldquo;Something tells me you aren&rsquo;t going to let this go.&rdquo;</p><p>His dad shakes his head no and engulfs his son a tight hug earning a squeal from the basketball player. For a moment, T.J. and his father are carefree and messing around as they used to in old times. T.J. no longer holds a secret from his father, and his best friend in the world knows and accepts his identity. Plus, Cyrus Goodman is gay, cute as hell, and probably the sweetest person on the planet!</p>",

Ironically, learning about the existence of gay people in church is what made him realise he could like boys like that, and that he does.

He has to be careful to keep it from his siblings and his mom and step dad, which is a little toxing for Cyrus, but he doesn\u2019t complain. Of course TJ can tell though. He wants to say something, wants to\u00a0 show off his boyfriend so badly, if maybe it slightly is in spite. There\u2019s a point where he just..does it. Just snaps. Maybe something escalates to it but he\u2019s just like,\u00a0\u2018Well guess what, mom? Cyrus is my boyfriend. Yeah. Boyfriend.

He has to be careful to keep it from his siblings and his mom and step dad, which is a little toxing for Cyrus, but he doesn\u2019t complain. Of course TJ can tell though. He wants to say something, wants to\u00a0 show off his boyfriend so badly, if maybe it slightly is in spite. There\u2019s a point where he just..does it. Just snaps.

                "content": "<p>I have two dividing HCs, similar to how i see his family life.</p><p>On one side, I draw TJ&rsquo;s family life/parents off of the ever hoping Kippen siblings. Obviously Amber&rsquo;s parents fight a lot, that&rsquo;s canon. She said on the phone that she wasn&rsquo;t going to go home because it made her upset to see them fight and they .. didn&rsquo;t seem to care. Her dad lost his job and she has a job as a 14/15 year old&nbsp; to help compensate. Throw TJ into the mix then, a kid who has dyscalculia, didn&rsquo;t know how to do 3rd grade math in 7th grade and NO ONE knew or even THOUGHT he might have a learning disability? I don&rsquo;t see their parents as very&hellip;aware. They have marital and job issues, their kids have jobs to try to support them, and they don&rsquo;t care if their kids are struggling socially/in school or if they even make it home for the night. I think TJ being gay would be the LAST thing they would care about at that point. I will always hc TJ&rsquo;s parents as emotionally neglectful, that they just honestly don&rsquo;t care THAT MUCH about him (or Amber). Him being gay is just something he&rsquo;s known for a while and just&hellip;never really cared to tell his parents. It&rsquo;s not something he ever feels he would get satisfaction out of.</p><blockquote><p>In that retrospect, how I can see the situation going down is: He&rsquo;s with Cyrus, they hang out at TJ&rsquo;s house a lot since his parents are never there, they&rsquo;re on the couch together and maybe Amber is there too, just watching a movie and his dad comes home and Amber and TJ are..unbothered, don&rsquo;t care to even look up. And their dad is like&nbsp;&lsquo;who is this? Why is there another kid in our house?&rsquo; and TJ is just like&nbsp;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s Cyrus, my boyfriend&rsquo; and his dad is just like&nbsp;&lsquo;Okay well don&rsquo;t give him any of our food, I just went shopping&rsquo;&nbsp; and huffs off.
