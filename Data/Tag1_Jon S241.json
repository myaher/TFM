No matter how hard she tried, she couldn\u2019t do it. She couldn\u2019t draw the right lines, she couldn\u2019t draw the right shades, she couldn\u2019t capture what made her boyfriend unique and handsome.</p><p>Jon raised his eyebrows, but didn\u2019t move apart from that. \u201cAren&rsquo;t you a little harsh on yourself?\u201d He spoke softly, but his words echoed loud and clear through the silent dorm room. </p><p>Sansa\u2019s roommates knew when they had to leave her alone. Luckily. Both for them and for Sansa.</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m not a six year old girl drawing Christmas cards for fun anymore, Jon.\u201d Sansa rolled her eyes and she reached for a brand new empty paper. \u201cI&rsquo;m an art student and I don\u2019t want them to wonder why the hell they have ever accepted me in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey&rsquo;ll never do that.\u201d Jon shook his head.</p><p>\u201cStay still!\u201d Sansa hissed between her teeth and she bit on the back of her pencil.</p><p>Once upon a time the voice of her mother had always sounded in the back of her mind when she had done that. Pencil\u2019s weren\u2019t food and leaving toothmarks on them wasn\u2019t very lady like. Or something like that.</p><p>But biting the back of her pencil helped her to focus, to concentrate, to determine where she would start. Maybe her drawing simply sucked because she always started with the face.</p><p>Everyone knew that the face was the hardest. It was barely doable to draw two eyes even remotely alike and then there was a certain vividness in smiles and dimples that was almost impossible to catch. </p><!-- more --><p>Maybe this drawing would work out if she would start with his body. </p><p>Her steady hand draw a few lines and she cocked her head, staring at Jon once more and back at the paper in front of her. She drew a few more lines and then she looked again before she added some more. </p><p>It wasn\u2019t the first time Sansa noticed how perfect Jon\u2019s body was.</p><p>The first few nights they had spent together, her hands had traveled all over his body until she knew all the curves by heart. </p><p>When she closed her eyes she could draw his body in thin air with nothing but her hands. She could let her palms trace his imaginary shoulders. She could exactly tell how long his arms were, where the muscles of his abdomen were visible, how tensed they were under her touch. She could picture his hips and butt and knew exactly where to squeeze to make him squirm. And she knew exactly how tight to curl up her fingers to make him scream her name on top of her lungs.</p><p>\u201cSansa?\u201d Jon whispered her name and Sansa\u2019s eyes flashed open. \u201cIf you\u2019re gonna fall asleep, can you at least tell me so I can move again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Sansa shook her head and she concentrated on her empty paper again. \u201cDon&rsquo;t move! Not yet!\u201d She drew more lines, added some shadows and erased some of her work to start over again.</p><p>But no matter how perfect her lines were, they couldn\u2019t grasp the beauty called Jon Snow. </p><p>After another half an hour she once again shred her drawing into a thousand little pieces, falling on top of the other ones from her previous tries. </p><p>Jon pushed himself up. \u201cYou&rsquo;re really being too hard on yourself, Sansa.\u201d He stood up from the couch and wrapped his arms around her. He pulled her as close to her naked chest as possible and Sansa placed her hand on his sternum. </p><p>She could feel his heart beating in a rapid, but steady rhythm. Under the palm of her hand his chest moved quickly up and down. His heartbeat and breathing had a calming effect on her and while she closed her eyes and breathed in and out as deeply and calmly as she could, her hand started wandering again.</p><p>Under her touch all his muscles tensed and he held his breath for a few seconds when she let the tip of her finger circle around his nipple.</p><p>Maybe it was so hard and impossible to draw Jon because his body was art in itself already. It was as if the Gods had allowed their masterpiece to roam the earth, as if they had all contributed their talents and hard work until there was nothing but perfection left.</p><p>\u201cI should hand you in for my exam\u2026\u201d She whispered while she wrapped her hands around his waist to trace the hardened muscles in his back. </p><p>\u201cWouldn&rsquo;t that be copyright infringement?\u201d Jon stroke her long red hair and Sansa\u2019s lips curled up into a smile before he kissed her. \u201cYou didn\u2019t make me.\u201d</p><p>Sansa\u2019s smile brightened and she opened her eyes again so her glance could meet his. \u201cI could make someone with you?\u201d</p><p>Jon\u2019s laugh echoed all around her like a warm cocoon that could keep the rest of the big bad world out. \u201cI guess you came up with that a little late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly a little\u2026\u201d Sansa whispered. \u201cBut good art needs practice.\u201d She pulled her own dress over her head and kicked off her shoes. \u201cI&rsquo;ve got two years of study left. If we start practicing now, I can hand in our master piece to graduate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still have to hand in something else tomorrow\u2026\u201d Jon placed his hands on her shoulders and pushed her away. </p><p>Sansa rolled her eyes. \u201cYou&rsquo;re killing the mood here, Jon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon&rsquo;t artists create their best works when they\u2019re in terrible moods?\u201d Jon left a trace of kisses on her jaw, in her neck and on her naked shoulder.</p><p>Sansa moaned. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s sadness.\u201d She buried her sharp nails in his back and enjoyed Jon\u2019s scream hurting her ears. \u201cI like to believe that every extreme emotion works. The terrible moods and the ecstatic ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want ecstatic?\u201d Jon whispered in her ear and then he sucked on her earlobe. In one smooth movement he lifted her off the floor and carried her towards the bed in the corner. \u201cYour wish is my command, my queen.\u201d He gently placed her down, took off her briefs and spread her legs.</p><p>Yes, Sansa thought while Jon placed his hands on the insides of her thighs. She just had to get in the right mood and then she would be able to finish her art project before the deadline tomorrow.</p><p>A loud scream escaped her lips when Jon let his tongue circle around her clit.</p><p>Or maybe she would just tell her professor that the form of art she used for this project couldn\u2019t be handed in.</p>",

She just had to get in the right mood and then she would be able to finish her art project before the deadline tomorrow.</p><p>A loud scream escaped her lips when Jon let his tongue circle around her clit.</p><p>Or maybe she would just tell her professor that the form of art she used for this project couldn&rsquo;t be handed in.</p></p>",

Okay, I guess it&rsquo;s mostly Sansa lamenting on Jon&rsquo;s perfect body.</i></small></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Aargh!&rdquo; Sansa grabbed her paper and shred it to a thousand little pieces. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn&rsquo;t do it. She couldn&rsquo;t draw the right lines, she couldn&rsquo;t draw the right shades, she couldn&rsquo;t capture what made her boyfriend unique and handsome.</p>\n<p>Jon raised his eyebrows, but didn&rsquo;t move apart from that. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you a little harsh on yourself?&rdquo; He spoke softly, but his words echoed loud and clear through the silent dorm room. </p>\n<p>Sansa&rsquo;s roommates knew when they had to leave her alone. Luckily. Both for them and for Sansa.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a six year old girl drawing Christmas cards for fun anymore, Jon.&rdquo; Sansa rolled her eyes and she reached for a brand new empty paper. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an art student and I don&rsquo;t want them to wonder why the hell they have ever accepted me in the first place.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll never do that.&rdquo; Jon shook his head.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Stay still!&rdquo; Sansa hissed between her teeth and she bit on the back of her pencil.</p>\n<p>Once upon a time the voice of her mother had always sounded in the back of her mind when she had done that. Pencil&rsquo;s weren&rsquo;t food and leaving toothmarks on them wasn&rsquo;t very lady like. Or something like that.</p>\n<p>But biting the back of her pencil helped her to focus, to concentrate, to determine where she would start. Maybe her drawing simply sucked because she always started with the face.</p>\n<p>Everyone knew that the face was the hardest. It was barely doable to draw two eyes even remotely alike and then there was a certain vividness in smiles and dimples that was almost impossible to catch. </p>\n</p>",

His impulsive and careless approach to his affair with Lyanna combined with the currently mysterious haste he was in leads me to think he did not think that far. The priority was to complete the three heads of the dragon <i>now </i>and then think of the consequences later.</p><p>But you raise an interesting question about the possibility of Rhaegar intending to raise his child with Lyanna at court which is something I\u2019ve pondered before. It\u2019s certainly possible. I\u2019ve flirted before with the idea that Rhaegar might have entertained the thought that he was <i>needed</i> on the throne as an organizing principle for the War for the Dawn and as a prophetic guide for the three heads of the dragon. If so, I can see Rhaegar hoping to raise his children together so as to build a strong relationship between them and to give them the proper education for the prophetic saviors they were. For such a prophecy-oriented individual, training and educating the three heads on their magical destiny and responsibility would be an important priority and I definitely do not think Rhaegar entertained the thought of sending Lyanna on her merry way with his child, not when said child was immeasurably important to him to the point of causing a scandal at Harrenhal followed by a political crisis. As for where that leaves Elia, well, Elia fell to the very bottom on the list of Rhaegar\u2019s priorities in his single-minded pursuit of the prophecy and I don\u2019t expect that would change.<br/></p><p>But it\u2019s worth noting that we don\u2019t know what Rhaegars reaction to<i> Jon</i> would be. If the theory that Rhaegar was trying to recreate the three conquerors with his children is correct, Jon\u2019s gender would throw a wrench in his plans and I really can\u2019t say how he\u2019d react to it. It could be anything from reconsidering his conclusions wrt the prophecy and his children\u2019s place in it to shrugging off Jon\u2019s existence with the thought that, Idk, Orys Baratheon existed or something, and trying for another ice-based child - a girl this time - with Lyanna. I don\u2019t think he\u2019d change his mind about Aegon being the prince who was promised regardless because the symbolism of the comet during his conception is fairly strong, and I question if Rhaegar might be led to apply the heralds of the prince that was promised to the other two heads as well - after all, Rhaenys was also born amidst salt and smoke so perhaps, to Rhaegar\u2019s mind, Jon being the wrong gender can be attributed to the circumstances and location of his birth in Dorne lacking that - and react by shipping Lyanna to Dragonstone so that the next child would share the circumstances of her eldest brother and sister\u2019s birth. I am, of course, ignoring every other facet of the plot right now and pretty much shooting darts in the dark using nothing but conjecture. But I guess it\u2019s something to chew on in lieu of just \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af .<br/></p>",
