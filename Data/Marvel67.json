Except, now, \u00a0you couldn\u2019t help the anger and frustration boiling up because of your own actions.</p><p>In the aftermath of the breakdown, you\u2019d resolved to getting over it. There\u2019s nothing you could\u2019ve done, and although you had called off the friendship, you still felt that it was your duty to make sure he had his happiness, which for a while it seemed he did.</p><p>And so to help, you found a boy who did like you back. You had crossed paths in Science, and he was sweet and stuttery. He made you happy, mostly, and he was head over heels for you, but this is where things started to get complicated.</p><p>Ever since your confession, Peter had found himself seeing you where he shouldn\u2019t, and god did it eat him up inside. Sometimes he thought he could hear you say his name; sometimes he could smell your gum when he studied, he remembered how you\u2019d claimed chewing gum helped you remember concepts; sometimes he\u2019d catch himself leering towards a McDonald&rsquo;s trip, before he thought about how wrong it\u2019d feel without you stealing his fries and coming up with some silly excuse as to where the fries had gone; sometimes he thought his girlfriend\u2019s touch was your own. He just couldn\u2019t find comfort being with her like he used to, which in the end, caused him to end it with her.</p><p>When Peter broke it off with his girlfriend, part of him felt bad for her, but the larger part justified his actions; it was better to end things now rather than lead her on. Besides, he could finally be with you now and you\u2019d both be happy. It was for the best, for all of you, if he ended it then and there.</p><p>At least, that was how it was meant to go.</p><p>But when Peter swung over in his spandex suit that night, he\u2019d been crushed before he could start.</p><p>Excitement ran through his veins as he swung to your place. Images of you and how you\u2019d react passed through his mind. He could barely contain his smile when he reached your house, he had rehearsed how he\u2019d tell you that he loved you all the way, he pictured how it\u2019d feel when you\u2019d engulf him in your warmth, how your lips would feel on his. He could practically feel himself melting under your touch, sense your hands burying in his hair, the shine in your eyes when the two of you would separate. Finally, you could stop running around his head.</p><p>He almost knocked, almost. His knuckles were inches away from the surface of your window when he froze. \u00a0It felt like a bucket of cold water simultaneously poured over him while his insides burned with fire at the scene of you cuddled on the bed watching a movie with him. Your new boyfriend.</p><p>Peter didn\u2019t want to watch but he found he couldn\u2019t tear his eyes away from the way your boyfriend tenderly stroked your hair and how you nuzzled into his chest, from how badly Peter wanted to be in that boy\u2019s shoes.</p><p>Peter left that night feeling like the biggest loser; he had your heart in his hands, but he foolishly tossed it away and now he was suffering the consequences.</p><p>That wouldn\u2019t stop Pete from caring about you, though. He knew better than to try and weasel his way into your life again, especially when you were finally happy, but he didn\u2019t think you\u2019d notice his alter-ego.</p><p>And so he spent many nights on rooftops watching you walk home, making sure you were safe, keeping you out of trouble. Because despite the distance, the pain of the separation, he couldn\u2019t think of anything that would hurt him more than losing you.</p><p>Some nights this seemed like the worst thing he could do, when Peter broke it off with his girlfriend he knew it was for the best, but he\u2019d hoped it\u2019d be a new beginning for you both, not the beginning of the incessant ache in his chest.</p><p>For example, one night he watched you walk to a local restaurant looking like a star, and his heart leapt out of his chest as he watched your mannerisms, how you\u2019d tuck hair behind your ears, how you kept smiling giddily. He could swear he\u2019d never been more in love.</p><p>But his heart was soon shattered at the sight of your boyfriend jogging over to you, looking dashing. And the final stomp was when he leant down to kiss you so tenderly and instantly Peter\u2019s stomach bubbled hotly, it felt as though he\u2019d swallowed cement. He couldn\u2019t look away from you, you were positively glowing, something Peter could still see through his tears.</p><p>That was the last night Peter watched you walk home, though he still kept an eye out for any trouble coming your way, he couldn\u2019t bear to watch you walk home with your boyfriend, hand fitting so nicely in his as you laughed at each other\u2019s stories.</p><p>Eventually, you had left town for University, and Peter slowly began to move on. At least it seemed that way.</p><p>You had gone to study at Oxford in the UK, whereas Peter had gone to MIT, being oceans apart made the chances of you two meeting again more unlikely, however, this did not stop it from happening.</p><p>Tony had ordered Peter to transfer to Oxford due to a recent safety concern there and in the hopes of bringing ease to the people\u2019s minds at the presence of a vigilante to protect them.</p><p>Of course, Peter had no idea if you were still in Oxford at all, hypothetically you should be still studying there, but Peter didn\u2019t really care to re-open the wound.</p><p>Peter was currently off duty and he took that chance to explore the area as he strolled through the streets in his grey jumper. He glanced down at his phone for less than five seconds when he stepped onto the road. A car came roaring his way and he was a deer in the headlights, his feet wouldn\u2019t move and the distinct screeching of the tires that barreled towards him was overpowered by his heart thundering in his chest. could only hear his heartbeat overpowering the screeching of the tires as his heart thundered in his chest.</p><p>\u2018This is it.\u2019 He thought \u2018This is where Peter Parker meets his end.\u2019</p><p>Peter closed his eyes, preparing himself for impact while he listed off everyone who meant anyone to him.</p><p>That\u2019s when he felt a hand on his arm and a shocking yank. He stumbled and fell over his own feet. His hands hit the cold concrete pavement, but he was alive. Oh, how alive he was. He could hear his breathing, could feel his heartbeat in his chest. He laughed incredulously and got up, dusting himself off.</p><p>\u201cYou alright, love?\u201d he heard a soft voice ring, a voice that was warm and felt like home. Like laughter ringing on late night study dates, like cold ice cream and feet in ponds, like stealing sweaters and chases through the house. It felt like you.</p><p>His cheeks warmed when it clicked, he looked up at you quickly.</p><p>And my god, you took his breath away.</p><p>To Peter, you\u2019d always been beautiful. Both physically, mentally and emotionally. Perhaps to him, you were more beautiful than to others. To him, you\u2019d always been golden.

Your face was mature and natural, everything was perfect and you\u2019d taken to accepting yourself more. He noted the way you\u2019d changed your style. It was bolder, and now things fit better. One thing that had never changed was your eyes. They shone with concern and bewilderment, adrenaline shocking your irises.

He could barely contain his smile when he reached your house, he had rehearsed how he&rsquo;d tell you that he loved you all the way, he pictured how it&rsquo;d feel when you&rsquo;d engulf him in your warmth, how your lips would feel on his. He could practically feel himself melting under your touch, sense your hands burying in his hair, the shine in your eyes when the two of you would separate. Finally, you could stop running around his head.</p><p>He almost knocked, almost.

He knew better than to try and weasel his way into your life again, especially when you were finally happy, but he didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d notice his alter-ego.</p><p>And so he spent many nights on rooftops watching you walk home, making sure you were safe, keeping you out of trouble.

Except, now, &nbsp;you couldn&rsquo;t help the anger and frustration boiling up because of your own actions.</p>\n<p>In the aftermath of the breakdown, you&rsquo;d resolved to getting over it. There&rsquo;s nothing you could&rsquo;ve done, and although you had called off the friendship, you still felt that it was your duty to make sure he had his happiness, which for a while it seemed he did.</p>\n<p>And so to help, you found a boy who did like you back. You had crossed paths in Science, and he was sweet and stuttery. He made you happy, mostly, and he was head over heels for you, but this is where things started to get complicated.</p>\n<p>Ever since your confession, Peter had found himself seeing you where he shouldn&rsquo;t, and god did it eat him up inside. Sometimes he thought he could hear you say his name; sometimes he could smell your gum when he studied, he remembered how you&rsquo;d claimed chewing gum helped you remember concepts; sometimes he&rsquo;d catch himself leering towards a McDonald&rsquo;s trip, before he thought about how wrong it&rsquo;d feel without you stealing his fries and coming up with some silly excuse as to where the fries had gone; sometimes he thought his girlfriend&rsquo;s touch was your own. He just couldn&rsquo;t find comfort being with her like he used to, which in the end, caused him to end it with her.</p>\n<p>When Peter broke it off with his girlfriend, part of him felt bad for her, but the larger part justified his actions; it was better to end things now rather than lead her on. Besides, he could finally be with you now and you&rsquo;d both be happy. It was for the best, for all of you, if he ended it then and there.</p>\n<p>At least, that was how it was meant to go.</p>\n<p>But when Peter swung over in his spandex suit that night, he&rsquo;d been crushed before he could start.</p>\n<p>Excitement ran through his veins as he swung to your place.
