It\u2019s midterm season and there are so many subjects to study for!\u201d He said, flopping down in one of the rolling chairs and spinning slowly in it. </p><p>You did the same. \u201cMy brain feels like mush.\u201d</p><p>Bruce set down his notepad and stepped over to his desk to swig down some of his cold coffee. \u201cYou both will be fine.\u201d</p><p>You sat up and rested your elbows on your knees, and rested your chin in your hands. \u201cThat\u2019s easy for you to say, Mr. world-renowned expert in biochemistry, nuclear physics, and gamma radiation! I\u2019m dumber than a box of rocks.\u201d</p><p>Bruce hid his smile behind his coffee cup as he took another sip. \u201cYou\u2019re both smart kids! Don\u2019t put yourself down! Peter is brilliant at math. Maybe he can help you with that?\u201d</p><p>Peter uncovered his eyes and sat up. \u201cThat\u2019s the plan, but we still have Literature, History, Biology/ Chemistry to study for, and I don\u2019t know anything about history. It\u2019s never been my strong-suit.\u201d</p><p>You huffed. \u201cAnd I love science, but it\u2019s all of the chemical equations that don\u2019t stick\u2026\u201d</p><p>You wanted to ask Bruce to help you, but how were you supposed to ask the Doctor Robert Bruce Banner to help you with your homework?</p><p>As if an answer to your silent prayer, Tony shrunk the hologram and turned to face the two of you.\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cAlright. How about this,\u201d he walked to the desk that was across from you and leaned back on it. \u201cBruce and I will help you with Biology and Chemistry. I\u2019m sure Steve has no problem teaching you a bit of history, saying as he was part of it, so just ask him. As for literature, as much as I hate to say it, Loki would be your best bet. He\u2019s at least 1,000 years old and would know the evolution of language and customs better than anyone. I\u2019d say to ask him about history, but I don\u2019t know how well I would trust that information.\u201d</p><p>You just sat there in shock and awe that The Avengers\u2122 were offering to help you and Peter with your school-work.</p><p>At this time, you had no clue that Peter was Spider-Man. He was just a friend from school that you had gotten close to. He told you and his other friends about his Stark Internship, which was overheard, then spread like wildfire across the school. Everyone wanted to tag along with him and be his friend to get to Tony Stark, which you, Ned, and MJ thought was repulsive. </p><p>Peter knew he couldn\u2019t bring Ned with him to meet The Avengers because he was too curious, too loud, and wouldn\u2019t know how to keep his mouth shut at school. He thought about bring MJ, but honestly, he didn\u2019t know her that well yet. Now, you, he knew he could trust. He had confided so many things in you, testing with small things to see if they would get out to other people, but they didn\u2019t. After two years of being friends, he knew he could trust you with everything\u2026 well\u2026 almost everything. </p><p>For the past few months, you had tagged along with Peter after school on Wednesdays to visit Tony and Bruce. You hadn\u2019t really gotten to meet anyone else except in passing, so Tony telling you to ask Captain Steve Rogers to help you with homework was mind boggling. Then he told you to ask The God of Mischief, aka the crazy guy who tried to enslave New York and destroy the world, to help with you with english literature.</p><p><i>What is my life</i>? You asked yourself.</p><p>Two consecutive snaps of Tony\u2019s fingers in your face jolted you from the little world you had escaped to in your mind. </p><p>\u201cHey. You with us, kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm. Yeah. Sorry.\u201d You said while nervously picking at your fingernails.</p><p>Tony let out a small laugh. \u201cWhere were you just now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust thinking about the fact that the Avengers are about to help me study for my midterm, and trying to figure out how the hell I got to this point in my life.\u201d A small blush spread across your cheeks at the immediate embarrassment of how dorky you sounded</p><p>Peter must have noticed, and laughed while patting you on the back. \u201cI ask myself that question every day. I mean, come on, man! Tony Stark came to me and wanted me to be part of his internship! How crazy is that!?\u201d He exclaimed.</p><p>Tony smirked. \u201cYou got skill, kid. I\u2019ll give you that.\u201d</p><p>He walked over and grabbed both of your back packs and pulled them to a larger table near the center of the room.<br/>\u201cShort break and we\u2019ll begin.\u201d</p><p>The four of you made your way to the living room area to watch some television and unwind. </p><p>Upon entering, you saw Natasha, Steve, and Clint sitting on the big L shaped couch watching some kind of mystery documentary. The three of them greeted you and Peter, and welcomed you to sit down with them. You found a spot between Steve and Natasha and sat down. Peter didn\u2019t seemed phased sitting there with them, but you were. You were sitting next to, allegedly, the world\u2019s greatest spy/ assassin, and were an arms length away from history\u2019s greatest science project. </p><p>Tony ordered Chinese take out, which arrived within minutes of ordering.</p><p>You sat with everyone and ate in silence, still overwhelmed by that amount of knowledge and skill in one room. You were starstruck, and somehow had to work up the never to ask Steve to help you with your homework. </p><p>After about 45 minutes of watching the episode that was on the big flat screen, Natasha gently jabbed you with her elbow.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been awfully quiet. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>You jolted at the sudden contact and looked at her. \u201cOh. Uh. Nothing.\u201d</p><p>She uncrossed her legs and faced toward you a little more. \u201cY/N,\u201d she stated, \u201cI lie for a living. You\u2019re going to have to do better than \u2018nothing\u2019.\u201d</p><p>You looked over at Steve, who\u2019s attention was still fixed on the TV, then over to Clint and Peter, who were in the middle of their own conversation on the opposite side of the couch, and lastly at Bruce, who was passed out in the recliner, then sighed. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s stupid&hellip;\u201d You breath.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not stupid.\u201d She reassured.</p><p>You inhaled deeply. \u201cPeter and I are studying for our midterms, and I need help with a few subjects. Dr. Banner, and Mr. Stark are going to help us with the science stuff, Peter is going to help me with math, but\u2026\u201d</p><p>Nat\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly in confusion. \u201cBut?\u201d She prompted.</p><p>You glanced at Steve who was still enveloped by the show. </p><p>\u201cMr. Stark said I should ask Captain Rogers for help with history\u2026\u201d</p><p>Steve turned his head to you and tried to hold back a smile. \u201cI\u2019d be happy to help.\u201d </p><p>You jumped at his booming voice coming from behind you. Both Natasha and Steve laughed while you were a blushing mess.</p><p>Steve leaned and nudged you with his broad shoulder. <br/>\u201cDid you really think I couldn\u2019t hear you talking when you\u2019re barely four feet away from me?\u201d</p><p>You continued blushing. \u201cI- well, you were watching tv and-\u201d</p><p>Steve laughed \u201cI may be 100 years old, but I\u2019m not an old man who can only focus on one thing at a time. By the way, that wasn\u2019t a stupid question. Don\u2019t put yourself down like that.\u201d</p><p>You awkwardly laughed. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to call you old! And uh. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Technically, if we ignore the 70 some-odd years I was in the ice, I\u2019d be about 30.\u201d</p><p>Steve and you then proceeded to talk about what topics you\u2019ll have to cover to get an idea of what he can help you with.</p><p>After the show finished, you, Peter, Tony, and Bruce made your way back to the lab.<br/>Once in there, homework and studying hit hard. </p><p>Tony and Bruce had scrap pieces of paper and showed you how the chemical equations worked step by step. After you and Peter got Chemistry down, you moved to biology and microbiology. That was more Bruce\u2019s field, so he showed you the different sites on the body where different bacterial infections could occur, which bacteria grow on which plate medias, what air conditions are needed for each to grow properly, and how long they need to incubate. <br/>Once you finished the book work for that, Bruce pulled out a few specimens and show you how to properly plate them. Thankfully, you were a hands-on learner, so that helped you greatly.</p><p>Hours passed, and soon, the sun was setting. You and Peter gathered up your things and headed to your respective homes before curfew.</p><p>The next day, after school, you and Peter headed back to The Tower for another round of studying. You told your parents, and they were all for it. </p><p>When you both arrived, FRIDAY directed you to go to the library to meet with Steve.</p><p>Steve sat, hunched over a large, slightly browned, leather-backed book. He had on a blue and white plaid shirt that was rolled up to his elbows and a pair of dark grey, high waisted, trousers. </p><p>For some godforsaken reason, the line \u201c<i>I wear your grandad&rsquo;s clothes. I look incredible</i>\u201d played through your head, and you had to stifle back a laugh.</p><p>He looked up from his book. \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>You looked over at Peter who had a slightly confused expression on his face, but also somewhat smiling, knowing that whatever it was, he\u2019d probably laugh as well.<br/>You bursted out laughing and slapped your hand over your mouth for a second so you could compose yourself.</p><p>\u201cThe bridge towards the end of the <i>Thrift Shop</i> by Macklemore\u2026\u201d You said vaguely. His brows knit together in thought, then he looked at Steve, and realization hit him hard. He laughed so hard that he fell on the ground; you laughed and doubled over with tears in your eyes.</p><p>Poor Steve was sat at the old oak table wondering why the two of you were laughing at him. He looked himself over to see what was wrong with his appearance, and you felt so bad.</p><p>After another minute of calming down, you set your things on a chair across from him and wiped the last tear that tried to escape. <br/>\u201cWe\u2019re not laughing at you, Captain Rogers. Your outfit reminded me of a line from a song is all.\u201d</p><p>Steve frowned. \u201cAnd what would that be?\u201d</p><p>Peter stood up and started singing \u201c<i>I wear your your granddad\u2019s clothes. I look incredible</i>.\u201d</p><p>You reached over and smacked Peter on the shoulder. \u201cKnock it off!\u201d </p><p>You looked at Steve and tried holding back a smile. \u201cNothing is wrong with what you\u2019re wearing. It\u2019s what you wore back when you were growing up. Saying as you were born in 1918, and I was born in 2002, you\u2019re technically old enough to be my great, great grandfather.\u201d </p><p>Steve physically cringed at this information that he never needed to hear. \u201cYeah okay. Great\u2026 Can we just get on with history\u2026\u201d His face was still wrinkled up in mild disgust and discomfort. </p><p>To get such a reaction out of Captain America, you had a sense of pride in that.</p><p>Steve started his teaching with the Civil War. His grandfather fought in that war and kept a notebook of events and details he remembered when he was in the service. After he passed, it was passed on to Steve\u2019s dad, and eventually to him. Thankfully, Howard kept all of his belonging in a safe vault that was passed down to Tony. <br/>Steve matched what his grandfather wrote to what was written in the older history book that was in front of him. </p><p>From there, they moved on the the first World War, which his father fought and died in. His dad wrote in a little notebook, just like his dad did, and eventually, it was passed to Steve as well\u2014 the only way to remember his dad. Again, he fact checked between what his dad wrote and what was written in the old and new textbooks.</p><p>Then they got to World War two. This topic went on forever, but neither of you minded. Steve told about the Nazi\u2019s, the normal factual things that would be in history book, and doing his best to avoid topics of Bucky, Peggy, Howard, and the Howling Commandos. Sometimes, he would go off on a tangent about how wonder the people in his life were, telling stories, reliving the memories, but they all lead back to either how they died or how he left them behind. Bucky was brought up quite a bit. It was obvious that he was fresh on Steve\u2019s mind, almost like an old wound had opened up. In those moments, you and Peter both changed the topic back to where they left off, and continued on.</p><p>Since the war didn\u2019t end until after he went into the ice, Steve had to rely heavily on his own research of the topic.</p><p>Hours passed, and all three of you were hungry. Steve decided that was enough for the day, so he asked if you and Peter could put away the books they pulled out before heading up to the kitchen. You read the shelves and eventually found where the one you had went. </p><p>As you turned down the correct isle, you saw Loki sitting on the windowsill, reading a book. A small yelp escaped from your throat and you jumped back. </p><p>Loki calmly looked over at you with a raised eyebrow. </p><p>Peter sprinted over to you and was about to ask what was wrong, but then he saw Loki. <br/>\u201cHi, Mr. Loki.\u201d Peter said with a nervous quiver to his voice.</p><p>\u201cAh. Parker. How is the studying going?\u201d</p><p><i>How does Peter know him!?</i> You thought</p><p>Loki\u2019s eyes landed on you. \u201cHe practically lives here. We were bound to meet at some point.\u201d</p><p>You froze in fear. <i>Did he just read my thoughts!?</i></p><p>\u201cYes I did. Now that that is out of the way, yes, I will help you with literature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you-\u201d Peter began</p><p>\u201cI have ears everywhere.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cDid you use your illusions!? That would be so cool\u2026 and kind of creepy, bUT super awesome! Is this an illusion?\u201d</p><p>He reached out to touch him on the shoulder, but Loki smacked his hand away. <br/>\u201cHey!\u201d He exclaimed, rubbing his wrist. <br/>\u201cIf you\u2019ll be back tomorrow, meet me here in the library and we will begin the lesson.\u201d Loki looked back down to his book as if neither of you were there, seemingly willing it into existence.</p><p>You and Peter exchanged a look and set off to the kitchen, where you grabbed something quick to eat before heading home for the evening.</p><p>It was finally Friday. This was the third day in a row where you got to go to Stark Towers, or now the Avengers Towers. You were surprised how human they all were- well, all except Loki. Of course you knew they were humans, but they were also superheros. They are idolized, and only the craziest headlines and stories show up on social media and the news. You never hear \u201cSam Wilson and Steve Rogers go to the grocery store\u201d, or \u201cNatasha Romanoff and Wanda Maximoff go to the movies\u201d, therefore never getting a sense of how \u201cnormal\u201d they are. </p><p>On the way to the Tower, you and Peter grabbed some street hot dogs and made your way to the library, knowing it was going to be another long afternoon.</p><p>Upon entering the room, you saw Loki sitting at the oak table; Not one, but four; one sat on each side of the table with a different book. </p><p>\u201cHoly shit!\u201d You and Peter exclaimed simultaneously. His was said in awe and admiration. Yours was said in shock and possibly fear.</p><p>All four of them looked at you and grinned before three disappeared into a small cloud of green and gold shimmer. </p><p>\u201cThat is so cool!\u201d Peter said excitedly, completely awestruck by his magic.</p><p>You were also impressed, but you were much more observant. \u201cWait. Since all four of you were reading different books, and they are all you, does that mean you literally just read four books at the same time!?\u201d</p><p>Loki chuckled lowly. \u201cClever girl. You\u2019re not as dumb as you think you are. There is hope for you to learn yet. Sit and we shall begin.\u201d</p><p>You were shocked by his words, but he wasn\u2019t wrong. You never thought you were the smartest. You barely scraped by in your classes and struggled learning the material presented to you. Clever is not the word you would have described yourself as.</p><p>Peter sat in the seat adjacent to him and look him with mild confusion across his face. \u201cWhy did you agree to help us?\u201d</p><p>You sat down adjacent to Peter and across from Loki, waiting for his response. </p><p>He exhaled sharply and looked at Peter. \u201cTo be quite honest, you\u2019re the only ones here who not only treats me normally, but takes interest in what I have to say.\u201d</p><p>Peter blinked at him. \u201cWell, you did try to take over my city and killed many innocent people, but I trusted Thor when he told me that you weren\u2019t like that. You lie and deceive, but you\u2019ve never been one to do all of that taking over stuff, so I decided to give you a chance, and you\u2019re actually pretty cool.\u201d</p><p>Loki smirked. \u201cI\u2019ll take that as a complement.\u201d</p><p>You all started on Shakespeare\u2019s Macbeth, one of Loki\u2019s favorites. As you all read out loud, taking turns, Loki translated old English into modern terms so you two could more easily understand. At a certain point, Loki got sick of you two stuttering and mispronouncing words, and took over reading the rest of the book/ play. It was so pleasant to the ears to hear his deep voice effortlessly read the text with perfect inflection and subtle voice acting. The pair of you filled out answers to your homework sheet as he read and took notes so that you could write your essay easier. </p><p>\u201cOf this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen, who, as &lsquo;tis thought, by self and violent hands took off her life; this, and what needful else that calls upon us, by the grace of Grace, we will perform in measure, time and place: So, thanks to all at once and to each one, whom we invite to see us crown&rsquo;d at Scone. End.\u201d</p><p>You and Peter set down your books and clapped enthusiastically while Loki faked a bow from his seat.</p><p>\u201cAny questions?\u201d He said with a slight smug look on his face. </p><p>You smiled at him. \u201cNot right now, but next week, I\u2019d like to do this again.\u201d You said at Loki, but also addressing Peter.</p><p>\u201cYeah! This was great. Thank you, Mr. Loki. Next week, we just need to focus on going over the material from the semester, and we should be good to go.\u201d Peter added.</p><p>That being said, it was exactly what the two of you did. You came back the following week on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday with Peter and continued on with your studying\u2014 Monday with Bruce and Tony, Wednesday with Steve, and Friday with Loki. Tuesday was set aside for you and Peter to help you get the math down, which thankfully didn\u2019t take too long.</p><p>You kept your nose to the books and rewrote notes, read them out loud, and were unafraid to ask any questions you may have had.</p><p>A few weeks later, was midterms week. Luckily, it was all done on the computer so you got your results immediately. Once you submitted your last exam on the last day of testing, you left the room, waiting for your friends. </p><p>One by one, MJ, Ned, and Peter trickled out of the room. All of you passed, and you had to do everything in your power not to squeal like a schoolgirl. You surprised yourself.</p><p>When school ended, you were about to head to the bus when a black car pulled up in front of you four and unrolled the window. </p><p>Happy Hogan was in the driver&rsquo;s seat. \u201cPeter, Y/N, Mr. Stark would like to see you both.\u201d He said very plainly. MJ and Ned looked at each other, then at you two. You felt bad that they weren\u2019t invited to go with you, but you also understood that if more people from the school started going to Stark Towers, the whole school would be wanting to go as well.</p><p>Both you and Peter must have felt the same way because the two of you looked at the other pair in an apologetic way.</p><p>MJ was the one to speak first. \u201cDon\u2019t stand here staring at us. Go!\u201d </p><p>Peter smiled at her and hopped in. Happy got out and held the door for you, to which you thanked him.</p><p>Once you arrived at the Towers, you were directed to go to the kitchen. Peter entered first and flicked on the lights.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCongratulations!\u201d A symphony of voices yelled.\u00a0</p><p>Tony, Bruce, Nat, Clint, Wanda, Vision, Steve, and even Loki all stood around the island, which had a large sheet cake in the middle.</p><p>Tony walked over and slapped a cheap, cone shaped party hat on both of your heads. \u201cYou passed. No, you didn\u2019t just pass, you both got all A\u2019s and a few B\u2019s on all of your exams! That calls for celebration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know that?\u201d You said, still a little in shock from the surprise. </p><p>Nat chuckled \u201cI can hack into government computers. You don\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to tap into a high school\u2019s student records?\u201d .</p><p>Peter stepped forward. \u201cThis is nice and all, but you do realize this was just a midterm, right? This wasn\u2019t even for the whole school year. This wasn\u2019t a graduation exam or anything.\u201d</p><p>Steve smiled. \u201cCelebrate the small victories. You both did great. You took your studies seriously and did everything you could to do more than just pass. That is what we\u2019re truly celebrating. This is especially for you, Y/N. We all noticed how you talked down about yourself, calling yourself dumb, and stupid, but look at you! You got some of the highest grades in your class! We\u2019re all so proud of you.\u201d</p><p>You teared up at his sweet words, but couldn\u2019t help but laugh. He sounded just like one of those dumb Captain America PSA\u2019s, but this one was so heartfelt and genuine. </p><p>Clint went to punch Steve on the shoulder, but it looked like he punched a brick wall with how little Steve moved, but he carried on anyway. \u201cEnough with the mush. Cake time!\u201d </p><p>Everyone gathered around as Clint cut unequally sized pieces and handed them to everyone, even Loki who turned up his nose at the Midgardian celebratory sweet. </p><p>The afternoon/ evening was spent talking and laughing with everyone gathered in the living room; conversation ranging anywhere from unclassified past missions, to what everyone\u2019s high school experience was, to what your plans were for the short winter break. </p><p>As the sun set, you and Peter said your goodbyes to the team, hoping to see them again in a couple weeks after vacation, but you never did. </p><p>News blew up towards the end of winter break about \u201cThe Winter Soldier\u201d again, having reappeared since the last attack on New York. Once school was back in session, Peter seemed a bit shaken up. You, Ned, and MJ tried talking it out of him, but he didn\u2019t budge. A week or so back in class, more news came up about the Avengers signing some kind of Accords. The next day, Peter didn\u2019t show up to school; no call, no show, just gone. </p><p>Watching the Avengers be pit against each other hurt. Tony against Steve, Nat against Clint, Wanda against Vision. It felt almost like a divorce. You hurt for them, and knew that Peter hurt for them too. You chalked up his absence from school as him mourning the divorce of his extended family, but you pushed on, because no matter what tried to get in your way, you remembered all of the lessons that everyone there taught you. More importantly, you learned to have faith in your mind, your abilities, and yourself. </p>",

How about this,\u201d he walked to the desk that was across from you and leaned back on it. \u201cBruce and I will help you with Biology and Chemistry. I\u2019m sure Steve has no problem teaching you a bit of history, saying as he was part of it, so just ask him. As for literature, as much as I hate to say it, Loki would be your best bet. He\u2019s at least 1,000 years old and would know the evolution of language and customs better than anyone. I\u2019d say to ask him about history, but I don\u2019t know how well I would trust that information.\u201d</p><p>You just sat there in shock and awe that The Avengers\u2122 were offering to help you and Peter with your school-work.</p><p>At this time, you had no clue that Peter was Spider-Man. He was just a friend from school that you had gotten close to. He told you and his other friends about his Stark Internship, which was overheard, then spread like wildfire across the school. Everyone wanted to tag along with him and be his friend to get to Tony Stark, which you, Ned, and MJ thought was repulsive. </p><p>Peter knew he couldn\u2019t bring Ned with him to meet The Avengers because he was too curious, too loud, and wouldn\u2019t know how to keep his mouth shut at school. He thought about bring MJ, but honestly, he didn\u2019t know her that well yet. Now, you, he knew he could trust. He had confided so many things in you, testing with small things to see if they would get out to other people, but they didn\u2019t. After two years of being friends, he knew he could trust you with everything\u2026 well\u2026 almost everything. </p><p>For the past few months, you had tagged along with Peter after school on Wednesdays to visit Tony and Bruce. You hadn\u2019t really gotten to meet anyone else except in passing, so Tony telling you to ask Captain Steve Rogers to help you with homework was mind boggling. Then he told you to ask The God of Mischief, aka the crazy guy who tried to enslave New York and destroy the world, to help with you with english literature.</p><p><i>What is my life</i>? You asked yourself.</p><p>Two consecutive snaps of Tony\u2019s fingers in your face jolted you from the little world you had escaped to in your mind. </p><p>\u201cHey. You with us, kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm. Yeah. Sorry.\u201d You said while nervously picking at your fingernails.</p><p>Tony let out a small laugh. \u201cWhere were you just now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust thinking about the fact that the Avengers are about to help me study for my midterm, and trying to figure out how the hell I got to this point in my life.\u201d A small blush spread across your cheeks at the immediate embarrassment of how dorky you sounded</p><p>Peter must have noticed, and laughed while patting you on the back. \u201cI ask myself that question every day. I mean, come on, man! Tony Stark came to me and wanted me to be part of his internship! How crazy is that!?\u201d He exclaimed.</p><p>Tony smirked. \u201cYou got skill, kid. I\u2019ll give you that.\u201d</p><p>He walked over and grabbed both of your back packs and pulled them to a larger table near the center of the room.<br>\u201cShort break and we\u2019ll begin.\u201d</p><p>The four of you made your way to the living room area to watch some television and unwind. </p><p>Upon entering, you saw Natasha, Steve, and Clint sitting on the big L shaped couch watching some kind of mystery documentary. The three of them greeted you and Peter, and welcomed you to sit down with them. You found a spot between Steve and Natasha and sat down. Peter didn\u2019t seemed phased sitting there with them, but you were. You were sitting next to, allegedly, the world\u2019s greatest spy/ assassin, and were an arms length away from history\u2019s greatest science project. </p><p>Tony ordered Chinese take out, which arrived within minutes of ordering.</p><p>You sat with everyone and ate in silence, still overwhelmed by that amount of knowledge and skill in one room. You were starstruck, and somehow had to work up the never to ask Steve to help you with your homework. </p><p>After about 45 minutes of watching the episode that was on the big flat screen, Natasha gently jabbed you with her elbow.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been awfully quiet. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>You jolted at the sudden contact and looked at her. \u201cOh. Uh. Nothing.\u201d</p><p>She uncrossed her legs and faced toward you a little more. \u201cY/N,\u201d she stated, \u201cI lie for a living. You\u2019re going to have to do better than \u2018nothing\u2019.\u201d</p><p>You looked over at Steve, who\u2019s attention was still fixed on the TV, then over to Clint and Peter, who were in the middle of their own conversation on the opposite side of the couch, and lastly at Bruce, who was passed out in the recliner, then sighed. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s stupid\u2026\u201d You breath.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not stupid.\u201d She reassured.</p><p>You inhaled deeply. \u201cPeter and I are studying for our midterms, and I need help with a few subjects. Dr. Banner, and Mr. Stark are going to help us with the science stuff, Peter is going to help me with math, but\u2026\u201d</p><p>Nat\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly in confusion. \u201cBut?\u201d She prompted.</p><p>You glanced at Steve who was still enveloped by the show. </p><p>\u201cMr. Stark said I should ask Captain Rogers for help with history\u2026\u201d</p><p>Steve turned his head to you and tried to hold back a smile. \u201cI\u2019d be happy to help.\u201d </p><p>You jumped at his booming voice coming from behind you. Both Natasha and Steve laughed while you were a blushing mess.</p><p>Steve leaned and nudged you with his broad shoulder. <br>\u201cDid you really think I couldn\u2019t hear you talking when you\u2019re barely four feet away from me?\u201d</p><p>You continued blushing. \u201cI- well, you were watching tv and-\u201d</p><p>Steve laughed \u201cI may be 100 years old, but I\u2019m not an old man who can only focus on one thing at a time. By the way, that wasn\u2019t a stupid question. Don\u2019t put yourself down like that.\u201d</p><p>You awkwardly laughed. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to call you old! And uh. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Technically, if we ignore the 70 some-odd years I was in the ice, I\u2019d be about 30.\u201d</p><p>Steve and you then proceeded to talk about what topics you\u2019ll have to cover to get an idea of what he can help you with.</p><p>After the show finished, you, Peter, Tony, and Bruce made your way back to the lab.<br>Once in there, homework and studying hit hard. </p><p>Tony and Bruce had scrap pieces of paper and showed you how the chemical equations worked step by step. After you and Peter got Chemistry down, you moved to biology and microbiology. That was more Bruce\u2019s field, so he showed you the different sites on the body where different bacterial infections could occur, which bacteria grow on which plate medias, what air conditions are needed for each to grow properly, and how long they need to incubate. <br>Once you finished the book work for that, Bruce pulled out a few specimens and show you how to properly plate them. Thankfully, you were a hands-on learner, so that helped you greatly.</p><p>Hours passed, and soon, the sun was setting. You and Peter gathered up your things and headed to your respective homes before curfew.</p><p>The next day, after school, you and Peter headed back to The Tower for another round of studying. You told your parents, and they were all for it. </p><p>When you both arrived, FRIDAY directed you to go to the library to meet with Steve.</p><p>Steve sat, hunched over a large, slightly browned, leather-backed book. He had on a blue and white plaid shirt that was rolled up to his elbows and a pair of dark grey, high waisted, trousers. </p><p>For some godforsaken reason, the line \u201c<i>I wear your grandad\u2019s clothes. I look incredible</i>\u201d played through your head, and you had to stifle back a laugh.</p><p>He looked up from his book. \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>You looked over at Peter who had a slightly confused expression on his face, but also somewhat smiling, knowing that whatever it was, he\u2019d probably laugh as well.<br>You bursted out laughing and slapped your hand over your mouth for a second so you could compose yourself.</p><p>\u201cThe bridge towards the end of the <i>Thrift Shop</i> by Macklemore\u2026\u201d You said vaguely. His brows knit together in thought, then he looked at Steve, and realization hit him hard. He laughed so hard that he fell on the ground; you laughed and doubled over with tears in your eyes.</p><p>Poor Steve was sat at the old oak table wondering why the two of you were laughing at him. He looked himself over to see what was wrong with his appearance, and you felt so bad.</p><p>After another minute of calming down, you set your things on a chair across from him and wiped the last tear that tried to escape. <br>\u201cWe\u2019re not laughing at you, Captain Rogers. Your outfit reminded me of a line from a song is all.\u201d</p><p>Steve frowned. \u201cAnd what would that be?\u201d</p><p>Peter stood up and started singing \u201c<i>I wear your your granddad\u2019s clothes. I look incredible</i>.\u201d</p><p>You reached over and smacked Peter on the shoulder. \u201cKnock it off!\u201d </p><p>You looked at Steve and tried holding back a smile. \u201cNothing is wrong with what you\u2019re wearing. It\u2019s what you wore back when you were growing up. Saying as you were born in 1918, and I was born in 2002, you\u2019re technically old enough to be my great, great grandfather.\u201d </p><p>Steve physically cringed at this information that he never needed to hear. \u201cYeah okay. Great\u2026 Can we just get on with history\u2026\u201d His face was still wrinkled up in mild disgust and discomfort. </p><p>To get such a reaction out of Captain America, you had a sense of pride in that.</p><p>Steve started his teaching with the Civil War. His grandfather fought in that war and kept a notebook of events and details he remembered when he was in the service. After he passed, it was passed on to Steve\u2019s dad, and eventually to him. Thankfully, Howard kept all of his belonging in a safe vault that was passed down to Tony. <br>Steve matched what his grandfather wrote to what was written in the older history book that was in front of him. </p><p>From there, they moved on the the first World War, which his father fought and died in. His dad wrote in a little notebook, just like his dad did, and eventually, it was passed to Steve as well\u2014 the only way to remember his dad. Again, he fact checked between what his dad wrote and what was written in the old and new textbooks.</p><p>Then they got to World War two. This topic went on forever, but neither of you minded. Steve told about the Nazi\u2019s, the normal factual things that would be in history book, and doing his best to avoid topics of Bucky, Peggy, Howard, and the Howling Commandos. Sometimes, he would go off on a tangent about how wonder the people in his life were, telling stories, reliving the memories, but they all lead back to either how they died or how he left them behind. Bucky was brought up quite a bit. It was obvious that he was fresh on Steve\u2019s mind, almost like an old wound had opened up. In those moments, you and Peter both changed the topic back to where they left off, and continued on.</p><p>Since the war didn\u2019t end until after he went into the ice, Steve had to rely heavily on his own research of the topic.</p><p>Hours passed, and all three of you were hungry. Steve decided that was enough for the day, so he asked if you and Peter could put away the books they pulled out before heading up to the kitchen. You read the shelves and eventually found where the one you had went. </p><p>As you turned down the correct isle, you saw Loki sitting on the windowsill, reading a book. A small yelp escaped from your throat and you jumped back. </p><p>Loki calmly looked over at you with a raised eyebrow. </p><p>Peter sprinted over to you and was about to ask what was wrong, but then he saw Loki. <br>\u201cHi, Mr. Loki.\u201d Peter said with a nervous quiver to his voice.</p><p>\u201cAh. Parker. How is the studying going?\u201d</p><p><i>How does Peter know him!?</i> You thought</p><p>Loki\u2019s eyes landed on you. \u201cHe practically lives here. We were bound to meet at some point.\u201d</p><p>You froze in fear. <i>Did he just read my thoughts!?</i></p><p>\u201cYes I did. Now that that is out of the way, yes, I will help you with literature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you-\u201d Peter began</p><p>\u201cI have ears everywhere.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cDid you use your illusions!? That would be so cool\u2026 and kind of creepy, bUT super awesome! Is this an illusion?\u201d</p><p>He reached out to touch him on the shoulder, but Loki smacked his hand away. <br>\u201cHey!\u201d He exclaimed, rubbing his wrist. <br>\u201cIf you\u2019ll be back tomorrow, meet me here in the library and we will begin the lesson.\u201d Loki looked back down to his book as if neither of you were there, seemingly willing it into existence.</p><p>You and Peter exchanged a look and set off to the kitchen, where you grabbed something quick to eat before heading home for the evening.</p><p>It was finally Friday. This was the third day in a row where you got to go to Stark Towers, or now the Avengers Towers. You were surprised how human they all were- well, all except Loki. Of course you knew they were humans, but they were also superheros. They are idolized, and only the craziest headlines and stories show up on social media and the news. You never hear \u201cSam Wilson and Steve Rogers go to the grocery store\u201d, or \u201cNatasha Romanoff and Wanda Maximoff go to the movies\u201d, therefore never getting a sense of how \u201cnormal\u201d they are. </p><p>On the way to the Tower, you and Peter grabbed some street hot dogs and made your way to the library, knowing it was going to be another long afternoon.</p><p>Upon entering the room, you saw Loki sitting at the oak table; Not one, but four; one sat on each side of the table with a different book. </p><p>\u201cHoly shit!\u201d You and Peter exclaimed simultaneously. His was said in awe and admiration. Yours was said in shock and possibly fear.</p><p>All four of them looked at you and grinned before three disappeared into a small cloud of green and gold shimmer. </p><p>\u201cThat is so cool!\u201d Peter said excitedly, completely awestruck by his magic.</p><p>You were also impressed, but you were much more observant. \u201cWait. Since all four of you were reading different books, and they are all you, does that mean you literally just read four books at the same time!?\u201d</p><p>Loki chuckled lowly. \u201cClever girl. You\u2019re not as dumb as you think you are. There is hope for you to learn yet. Sit and we shall begin.\u201d</p><p>You were shocked by his words, but he wasn\u2019t wrong. You never thought you were the smartest. You barely scraped by in your classes and struggled learning the material presented to you. Clever is not the word you would have described yourself as.</p><p>Peter sat in the seat adjacent to him and look him with mild confusion across his face. \u201cWhy did you agree to help us?\u201d</p><p>You sat down adjacent to Peter and across from Loki, waiting for his response. </p><p>He exhaled sharply and looked at Peter. \u201cTo be quite honest, you\u2019re the only ones here who not only treats me normally, but takes interest in what I have to say.\u201d</p><p>Peter blinked at him. \u201cWell, you did try to take over my city and killed many innocent people, but I trusted Thor when he told me that you weren\u2019t like that. You lie and deceive, but you\u2019ve never been one to do all of that taking over stuff, so I decided to give you a chance, and you\u2019re actually pretty cool.\u201d</p><p>Loki smirked. \u201cI\u2019ll take that as a complement.\u201d</p><p>You all started on Shakespeare\u2019s Macbeth, one of Loki\u2019s favorites. As you all read out loud, taking turns, Loki translated old English into modern terms so you two could more easily understand. At a certain point, Loki got sick of you two stuttering and mispronouncing words, and took over reading the rest of the book/ play. It was so pleasant to the ears to hear his deep voice effortlessly read the text with perfect inflection and subtle voice acting. The pair of you filled out answers to your homework sheet as he read and took notes so that you could write your essay easier. </p><p>\u201cOf this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen, who, as \u2018tis thought, by self and violent hands took off her life; this, and what needful else that calls upon us, by the grace of Grace, we will perform in measure, time and place: So, thanks to all at once and to each one, whom we invite to see us crown\u2019d at Scone. End.\u201d</p><p>You and Peter set down your books and clapped enthusiastically while Loki faked a bow from his seat.</p><p>\u201cAny questions?\u201d He said with a slight smug look on his face. </p><p>You smiled at him. \u201cNot right now, but next week, I\u2019d like to do this again.\u201d You said at Loki, but also addressing Peter.</p><p>\u201cYeah! This was great. Thank you, Mr. Loki. Next week, we just need to focus on going over the material from the semester, and we should be good to go.\u201d Peter added.</p><p>That being said, it was exactly what the two of you did. You came back the following week on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday with Peter and continued on with your studying\u2014 Monday with Bruce and Tony, Wednesday with Steve, and Friday with Loki. Tuesday was set aside for you and Peter to help you get the math down, which thankfully didn\u2019t take too long.</p><p>You kept your nose to the books and rewrote notes, read them out loud, and were unafraid to ask any questions you may have had.</p><p>A few weeks later, was midterms week. Luckily, it was all done on the computer so you got your results immediately. Once you submitted your last exam on the last day of testing, you left the room, waiting for your friends. </p><p>One by one, MJ, Ned, and Peter trickled out of the room. All of you passed, and you had to do everything in your power not to squeal like a schoolgirl. You surprised yourself.</p><p>When school ended, you were about to head to the bus when a black car pulled up in front of you four and unrolled the window. </p><p>Happy Hogan was in the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cPeter, Y/N, Mr. Stark would like to see you both.\u201d He said very plainly. MJ and Ned looked at each other, then at you two. You felt bad that they weren\u2019t invited to go with you, but you also understood that if more people from the school started going to Stark Towers, the whole school would be wanting to go as well.</p><p>Both you and Peter must have felt the same way because the two of you looked at the other pair in an apologetic way.</p><p>MJ was the one to speak first. \u201cDon\u2019t stand here staring at us. Go!\u201d </p><p>Peter smiled at her and hopped in. Happy got out and held the door for you, to which you thanked him.</p><p>Once you arrived at the Towers, you were directed to go to the kitchen. Peter entered first and flicked on the lights.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCongratulations!\u201d A symphony of voices yelled.\u00a0</p><p>Tony, Bruce, Nat, Clint, Wanda, Vision, Steve, and even Loki all stood around the island, which had a large sheet cake in the middle.</p><p>Tony walked over and slapped a cheap, cone shaped party hat on both of your heads. \u201cYou passed. No, you didn\u2019t just pass, you both got all A\u2019s and a few B\u2019s on all of your exams! That calls for celebration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know that?\u201d You said, still a little in shock from the surprise. </p><p>Nat chuckled \u201cI can hack into government computers. You don\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to tap into a high school\u2019s student records?\u201d .</p><p>Peter stepped forward. \u201cThis is nice and all, but you do realize this was just a midterm, right? This wasn\u2019t even for the whole school year. This wasn\u2019t a graduation exam or anything.\u201d</p><p>Steve smiled. \u201cCelebrate the small victories. You both did great. You took your studies seriously and did everything you could to do more than just pass. That is what we\u2019re truly celebrating. This is especially for you, Y/N. We all noticed how you talked down about yourself, calling yourself dumb, and stupid, but look at you! You got some of the highest grades in your class! We\u2019re all so proud of you.\u201d</p><p>You teared up at his sweet words, but couldn\u2019t help but laugh. He sounded just like one of those dumb Captain America PSA\u2019s, but this one was so heartfelt and genuine. </p><p>Clint went to punch Steve on the shoulder, but it looked like he punched a brick wall with how little Steve moved, but he carried on anyway. \u201cEnough with the mush. Cake time!\u201d </p><p>Everyone gathered around as Clint cut unequally sized pieces and handed them to everyone, even Loki who turned up his nose at the Midgardian celebratory sweet. </p><p>The afternoon/ evening was spent talking and laughing with everyone gathered in the living room; conversation ranging anywhere from unclassified past missions, to what everyone\u2019s high school experience was, to what your plans were for the short winter break. </p><p>As the sun set, you and Peter said your goodbyes to the team, hoping to see them again in a couple weeks after vacation, but you never did. </p><p>News blew up towards the end of winter break about \u201cThe Winter Soldier\u201d again, having reappeared since the last attack on New York. Once school was back in session, Peter seemed a bit shaken up. You, Ned, and MJ tried talking it out of him, but he didn\u2019t budge. A week or so back in class, more news came up about the Avengers signing some kind of Accords. The next day, Peter didn\u2019t show up to school; no call, no show, just gone. </p><p>Watching the Avengers be pit against each other hurt. Tony against Steve, Nat against Clint, Wanda against Vision. It felt almost like a divorce. You hurt for them, and knew that Peter hurt for them too. You chalked up his absence from school as him mourning the divorce of his extended family, but you pushed on, because no matter what tried to get in your way, you remembered all of the lessons that everyone there taught you. More importantly, you learned to have faith in your mind, your abilities, and yourself. </p>",

Peter is brilliant at math.

I\u2019m sure Steve has no problem teaching you a bit of history, saying as he was part of it, so just ask him. As for literature, as much as I hate to say it, Loki would be your best bet. He\u2019s at least 1,000 years old and would know the evolution of language and customs better than anyone. I\u2019d say to ask him about history, but I don\u2019t know how well I would trust that information.\u201d</p><p>You just sat there in shock and awe that The Avengers\u2122 were offering to help you and Peter with your school-work.</p><p>At this time, you had no clue that Peter was Spider-Man. He was just a friend from school that you had gotten close to. He told you and his other friends about his Stark Internship, which was overheard, then spread like wildfire across the school. Everyone wanted to tag along with him and be his friend to get to Tony Stark, which you, Ned, and MJ thought was repulsive. </p><p>Peter knew he couldn\u2019t bring Ned with him to meet The Avengers because he was too curious, too loud, and wouldn\u2019t know how to keep his mouth shut at school. He thought about bring MJ, but honestly, he didn\u2019t know her that well yet. Now, you, he knew he could trust. He had confided so many things in you, testing with small things to see if they would get out to other people, but they didn\u2019t. After two years of being friends, he knew he could trust you with everything\u2026 well\u2026 almost everything. </p><p>For the past few months, you had tagged along with Peter after school on Wednesdays to visit Tony and Bruce. You hadn\u2019t really gotten to meet anyone else except in passing, so Tony telling you to ask Captain Steve Rogers to help you with homework was mind boggling. Then he told you to ask The God of Mischief, aka the crazy guy who tried to enslave New York and destroy the world, to help with you with english literature.</p><p><i>What is my life</i>? You asked yourself.</p><p>Two consecutive snaps of Tony\u2019s fingers in your face jolted you from the little world you had escaped to in your mind. </p><p>\u201cHey. You with us, kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm. Yeah. Sorry.\u201d You said while nervously picking at your fingernails.</p><p>Tony let out a small laugh. \u201cWhere were you just now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust thinking about the fact that the Avengers are about to help me study for my midterm, and trying to figure out how the hell I got to this point in my life.\u201d A small blush spread across your cheeks at the immediate embarrassment of how dorky you sounded</p><p>Peter must have noticed, and laughed while patting you on the back. \u201cI ask myself that question every day. I mean, come on, man! Tony Stark came to me and wanted me to be part of his internship! How crazy is that!?\u201d He exclaimed.</p><p>Tony smirked. \u201cYou got skill, kid. I\u2019ll give you that.\u201d</p><p>He walked over and grabbed both of your back packs and pulled them to a larger table near the center of the room.<br>\u201cShort break and we\u2019ll begin.\u201d</p><p>The four of you made your way to the living room area to watch some television and unwind. </p><p>Upon entering, you saw Natasha, Steve, and Clint sitting on the big L shaped couch watching some kind of mystery documentary. The three of them greeted you and Peter, and welcomed you to sit down with them. You found a spot between Steve and Natasha and sat down. Peter didn\u2019t seemed phased sitting there with them, but you were. You were sitting next to, allegedly, the world\u2019s greatest spy/ assassin, and were an arms length away from history\u2019s greatest science project. </p><p>Tony ordered Chinese take out, which arrived within minutes of ordering.</p><p>You sat with everyone and ate in silence, still overwhelmed by that amount of knowledge and skill in one room. You were starstruck, and somehow had to work up the never to ask Steve to help you with your homework. </p><p>After about 45 minutes of watching the episode that was on the big flat screen, Natasha gently jabbed you with her elbow.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been awfully quiet. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>You jolted at the sudden contact and looked at her. \u201cOh. Uh. Nothing.\u201d</p><p>She uncrossed her legs and faced toward you a little more. \u201cY/N,\u201d she stated, \u201cI lie for a living. You\u2019re going to have to do better than \u2018nothing\u2019.\u201d</p><p>You looked over at Steve, who\u2019s attention was still fixed on the TV, then over to Clint and Peter, who were in the middle of their own conversation on the opposite side of the couch, and lastly at Bruce, who was passed out in the recliner, then sighed. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s stupid\u2026\u201d You breath.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not stupid.\u201d She reassured.</p><p>You inhaled deeply. \u201cPeter and I are studying for our midterms, and I need help with a few subjects. Dr. Banner, and Mr. Stark are going to help us with the science stuff, Peter is going to help me with math, but\u2026\u201d</p><p>Nat\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly in confusion. \u201cBut?\u201d She prompted.</p><p>You glanced at Steve who was still enveloped by the show. </p><p>\u201cMr. Stark said I should ask Captain Rogers for help with history\u2026\u201d</p><p>Steve turned his head to you and tried to hold back a smile. \u201cI\u2019d be happy to help.\u201d </p><p>You jumped at his booming voice coming from behind you. Both Natasha and Steve laughed while you were a blushing mess.</p><p>Steve leaned and nudged you with his broad shoulder. <br>\u201cDid you really think I couldn\u2019t hear you talking when you\u2019re barely four feet away from me?\u201d</p><p>You continued blushing. \u201cI- well, you were watching tv and-\u201d</p><p>Steve laughed \u201cI may be 100 years old, but I\u2019m not an old man who can only focus on one thing at a time. By the way, that wasn\u2019t a stupid question. Don\u2019t put yourself down like that.\u201d</p><p>You awkwardly laughed. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to call you old! And uh. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Technically, if we ignore the 70 some-odd years I was in the ice, I\u2019d be about 30.\u201d</p><p>Steve and you then proceeded to talk about what topics you\u2019ll have to cover to get an idea of what he can help you with.</p><p>After the show finished, you, Peter, Tony, and Bruce made your way back to the lab.<br>Once in there, homework and studying hit hard. </p><p>Tony and Bruce had scrap pieces of paper and showed you how the chemical equations worked step by step. After you and Peter got Chemistry down, you moved to biology and microbiology. That was more Bruce\u2019s field, so he showed you the different sites on the body where different bacterial infections could occur, which bacteria grow on which plate medias, what air conditions are needed for each to grow properly, and how long they need to incubate. <br>Once you finished the book work for that, Bruce pulled out a few specimens and show you how to properly plate them. Thankfully, you were a hands-on learner, so that helped you greatly.</p><p>Hours passed, and soon, the sun was setting. You and Peter gathered up your things and headed to your respective homes before curfew.</p><p>The next day, after school, you and Peter headed back to The Tower for another round of studying. You told your parents, and they were all for it. </p><p>When you both arrived, FRIDAY directed you to go to the library to meet with Steve.</p><p>Steve sat, hunched over a large, slightly browned, leather-backed book. He had on a blue and white plaid shirt that was rolled up to his elbows and a pair of dark grey, high waisted, trousers. </p><p>For some godforsaken reason, the line \u201c<i>I wear your grandad\u2019s clothes. I look incredible</i>\u201d played through your head, and you had to stifle back a laugh.</p><p>He looked up from his book. \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>You looked over at Peter who had a slightly confused expression on his face, but also somewhat smiling, knowing that whatever it was, he\u2019d probably laugh as well.<br>You bursted out laughing and slapped your hand over your mouth for a second so you could compose yourself.</p><p>\u201cThe bridge towards the end of the <i>Thrift Shop</i> by Macklemore\u2026\u201d You said vaguely. His brows knit together in thought, then he looked at Steve, and realization hit him hard. He laughed so hard that he fell on the ground; you laughed and doubled over with tears in your eyes.</p><p>Poor Steve was sat at the old oak table wondering why the two of you were laughing at him. He looked himself over to see what was wrong with his appearance, and you felt so bad.</p><p>After another minute of calming down, you set your things on a chair across from him and wiped the last tear that tried to escape. <br>\u201cWe\u2019re not laughing at you, Captain Rogers. Your outfit reminded me of a line from a song is all.\u201d</p><p>Steve frowned. \u201cAnd what would that be?\u201d</p><p>Peter stood up and started singing \u201c<i>I wear your your granddad\u2019s clothes. I look incredible</i>.\u201d</p><p>You reached over and smacked Peter on the shoulder. \u201cKnock it off!\u201d </p><p>You looked at Steve and tried holding back a smile. \u201cNothing is wrong with what you\u2019re wearing. It\u2019s what you wore back when you were growing up. Saying as you were born in 1918, and I was born in 2002, you\u2019re technically old enough to be my great, great grandfather.\u201d </p><p>Steve physically cringed at this information that he never needed to hear. \u201cYeah okay. Great\u2026 Can we just get on with history\u2026\u201d His face was still wrinkled up in mild disgust and discomfort. </p><p>To get such a reaction out of Captain America, you had a sense of pride in that.</p><p>Steve started his teaching with the Civil War. His grandfather fought in that war and kept a notebook of events and details he remembered when he was in the service. After he passed, it was passed on to Steve\u2019s dad, and eventually to him. Thankfully, Howard kept all of his belonging in a safe vault that was passed down to Tony. <br>Steve matched what his grandfather wrote to what was written in the older history book that was in front of him. </p><p>From there, they moved on the the first World War, which his father fought and died in. His dad wrote in a little notebook, just like his dad did, and eventually, it was passed to Steve as well\u2014 the only way to remember his dad. Again, he fact checked between what his dad wrote and what was written in the old and new textbooks.</p><p>Then they got to World War two. This topic went on forever, but neither of you minded. Steve told about the Nazi\u2019s, the normal factual things that would be in history book, and doing his best to avoid topics of Bucky, Peggy, Howard, and the Howling Commandos. Sometimes, he would go off on a tangent about how wonder the people in his life were, telling stories, reliving the memories, but they all lead back to either how they died or how he left them behind. Bucky was brought up quite a bit. It was obvious that he was fresh on Steve\u2019s mind, almost like an old wound had opened up. In those moments, you and Peter both changed the topic back to where they left off, and continued on.</p><p>Since the war didn\u2019t end until after he went into the ice, Steve had to rely heavily on his own research of the topic.</p><p>Hours passed, and all three of you were hungry. Steve decided that was enough for the day, so he asked if you and Peter could put away the books they pulled out before heading up to the kitchen. You read the shelves and eventually found where the one you had went. </p><p>As you turned down the correct isle, you saw Loki sitting on the windowsill, reading a book. A small yelp escaped from your throat and you jumped back. </p><p>Loki calmly looked over at you with a raised eyebrow. </p><p>Peter sprinted over to you and was about to ask what was wrong, but then he saw Loki. <br>\u201cHi, Mr. Loki.\u201d Peter said with a nervous quiver to his voice.</p><p>\u201cAh. Parker. How is the studying going?\u201d</p><p><i>How does Peter know him!?</i> You thought</p><p>Loki\u2019s eyes landed on you. \u201cHe practically lives here. We were bound to meet at some point.\u201d</p><p>You froze in fear. <i>Did he just read my thoughts!?</i></p><p>\u201cYes I did. Now that that is out of the way, yes, I will help you with literature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you-\u201d Peter began</p><p>\u201cI have ears everywhere.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cDid you use your illusions!? That would be so cool\u2026 and kind of creepy, bUT super awesome! Is this an illusion?\u201d</p><p>He reached out to touch him on the shoulder, but Loki smacked his hand away. <br>\u201cHey!\u201d He exclaimed, rubbing his wrist. <br>\u201cIf you\u2019ll be back tomorrow, meet me here in the library and we will begin the lesson.\u201d Loki looked back down to his book as if neither of you were there, seemingly willing it into existence.</p><p>You and Peter exchanged a look and set off to the kitchen, where you grabbed something quick to eat before heading home for the evening.</p><p>It was finally Friday. This was the third day in a row where you got to go to Stark Towers, or now the Avengers Towers. You were surprised how human they all were- well, all except Loki. Of course you knew they were humans, but they were also superheros. They are idolized, and only the craziest headlines and stories show up on social media and the news. You never hear \u201cSam Wilson and Steve Rogers go to the grocery store\u201d, or \u201cNatasha Romanoff and Wanda Maximoff go to the movies\u201d, therefore never getting a sense of how \u201cnormal\u201d they are. </p><p>On the way to the Tower, you and Peter grabbed some street hot dogs and made your way to the library, knowing it was going to be another long afternoon.</p><p>Upon entering the room, you saw Loki sitting at the oak table; Not one, but four; one sat on each side of the table with a different book. </p><p>\u201cHoly shit!\u201d You and Peter exclaimed simultaneously. His was said in awe and admiration. Yours was said in shock and possibly fear.</p><p>All four of them looked at you and grinned before three disappeared into a small cloud of green and gold shimmer. </p><p>\u201cThat is so cool!\u201d Peter said excitedly, completely awestruck by his magic.</p><p>You were also impressed, but you were much more observant. \u201cWait. Since all four of you were reading different books, and they are all you, does that mean you literally just read four books at the same time!?\u201d</p><p>Loki chuckled lowly. \u201cClever girl. You\u2019re not as dumb as you think you are. There is hope for you to learn yet. Sit and we shall begin.\u201d</p><p>You were shocked by his words, but he wasn\u2019t wrong. You never thought you were the smartest. You barely scraped by in your classes and struggled learning the material presented to you. Clever is not the word you would have described yourself as.</p><p>Peter sat in the seat adjacent to him and look him with mild confusion across his face. \u201cWhy did you agree to help us?\u201d</p><p>You sat down adjacent to Peter and across from Loki, waiting for his response. </p><p>He exhaled sharply and looked at Peter. \u201cTo be quite honest, you\u2019re the only ones here who not only treats me normally, but takes interest in what I have to say.\u201d</p><p>Peter blinked at him. \u201cWell, you did try to take over my city and killed many innocent people, but I trusted Thor when he told me that you weren\u2019t like that. You lie and deceive, but you\u2019ve never been one to do all of that taking over stuff, so I decided to give you a chance, and you\u2019re actually pretty cool.\u201d</p><p>Loki smirked. \u201cI\u2019ll take that as a complement.\u201d</p><p>You all started on Shakespeare\u2019s Macbeth, one of Loki\u2019s favorites. As you all read out loud, taking turns, Loki translated old English into modern terms so you two could more easily understand. At a certain point, Loki got sick of you two stuttering and mispronouncing words, and took over reading the rest of the book/ play. It was so pleasant to the ears to hear his deep voice effortlessly read the text with perfect inflection and subtle voice acting. The pair of you filled out answers to your homework sheet as he read and took notes so that you could write your essay easier. </p><p>\u201cOf this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen, who, as \u2018tis thought, by self and violent hands took off her life; this, and what needful else that calls upon us, by the grace of Grace, we will perform in measure, time and place: So, thanks to all at once and to each one, whom we invite to see us crown\u2019d at Scone. End.\u201d</p><p>You and Peter set down your books and clapped enthusiastically while Loki faked a bow from his seat.</p><p>\u201cAny questions?\u201d He said with a slight smug look on his face. </p><p>You smiled at him. \u201cNot right now, but next week, I\u2019d like to do this again.\u201d You said at Loki, but also addressing Peter.</p><p>\u201cYeah! This was great. Thank you, Mr. Loki. Next week, we just need to focus on going over the material from the semester, and we should be good to go.\u201d Peter added.</p><p>That being said, it was exactly what the two of you did. You came back the following week on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday with Peter and continued on with your studying\u2014 Monday with Bruce and Tony, Wednesday with Steve, and Friday with Loki. Tuesday was set aside for you and Peter to help you get the math down, which thankfully didn\u2019t take too long.</p><p>You kept your nose to the books and rewrote notes, read them out loud, and were unafraid to ask any questions you may have had.</p><p>A few weeks later, was midterms week. Luckily, it was all done on the computer so you got your results immediately. Once you submitted your last exam on the last day of testing, you left the room, waiting for your friends. </p><p>One by one, MJ, Ned, and Peter trickled out of the room. All of you passed, and you had to do everything in your power not to squeal like a schoolgirl. You surprised yourself.</p><p>When school ended, you were about to head to the bus when a black car pulled up in front of you four and unrolled the window. </p><p>Happy Hogan was in the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cPeter, Y/N, Mr. Stark would like to see you both.\u201d He said very plainly. MJ and Ned looked at each other, then at you two. You felt bad that they weren\u2019t invited to go with you, but you also understood that if more people from the school started going to Stark Towers, the whole school would be wanting to go as well.</p><p>Both you and Peter must have felt the same way because the two of you looked at the other pair in an apologetic way.</p><p>MJ was the one to speak first. \u201cDon\u2019t stand here staring at us. Go!\u201d </p><p>Peter smiled at her and hopped in. Happy got out and held the door for you, to which you thanked him.</p><p>Once you arrived at the Towers, you were directed to go to the kitchen. Peter entered first and flicked on the lights.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCongratulations!\u201d A symphony of voices yelled.\u00a0</p><p>Tony, Bruce, Nat, Clint, Wanda, Vision, Steve, and even Loki all stood around the island, which had a large sheet cake in the middle.</p><p>Tony walked over and slapped a cheap, cone shaped party hat on both of your heads. \u201cYou passed. No, you didn\u2019t just pass, you both got all A\u2019s and a few B\u2019s on all of your exams! That calls for celebration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know that?\u201d You said, still a little in shock from the surprise. </p><p>Nat chuckled \u201cI can hack into government computers. You don\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to tap into a high school\u2019s student records?\u201d .</p><p>Peter stepped forward. \u201cThis is nice and all, but you do realize this was just a midterm, right? This wasn\u2019t even for the whole school year. This wasn\u2019t a graduation exam or anything.\u201d</p><p>Steve smiled. \u201cCelebrate the small victories. You both did great. You took your studies seriously and did everything you could to do more than just pass. That is what we\u2019re truly celebrating. This is especially for you, Y/N. We all noticed how you talked down about yourself, calling yourself dumb, and stupid, but look at you! You got some of the highest grades in your class! We\u2019re all so proud of you.\u201d</p><p>You teared up at his sweet words, but couldn\u2019t help but laugh. He sounded just like one of those dumb Captain America PSA\u2019s, but this one was so heartfelt and genuine. </p><p>Clint went to punch Steve on the shoulder, but it looked like he punched a brick wall with how little Steve moved, but he carried on anyway. \u201cEnough with the mush. Cake time!\u201d </p><p>Everyone gathered around as Clint cut unequally sized pieces and handed them to everyone, even Loki who turned up his nose at the Midgardian celebratory sweet. </p><p>The afternoon/ evening was spent talking and laughing with everyone gathered in the living room; conversation ranging anywhere from unclassified past missions, to what everyone\u2019s high school experience was, to what your plans were for the short winter break. </p><p>As the sun set, you and Peter said your goodbyes to the team, hoping to see them again in a couple weeks after vacation, but you never did. </p><p>News blew up towards the end of winter break about \u201cThe Winter Soldier\u201d again, having reappeared since the last attack on New York. Once school was back in session, Peter seemed a bit shaken up. You, Ned, and MJ tried talking it out of him, but he didn\u2019t budge. A week or so back in class, more news came up about the Avengers signing some kind of Accords. The next day, Peter didn\u2019t show up to school; no call, no show, just gone. </p><p>Watching the Avengers be pit against each other hurt. Tony against Steve, Nat against Clint, Wanda against Vision. It felt almost like a divorce. You hurt for them, and knew that Peter hurt for them too. You chalked up his absence from school as him mourning the divorce of his extended family, but you pushed on, because no matter what tried to get in your way, you remembered all of the lessons that everyone there taught you. More importantly, you learned to have faith in your mind, your abilities, and yourself. </p>",

Sorry.&rdquo; You said while nervously picking at your fingernails.</p><p>Tony let out a small laugh. &ldquo;Where were you just now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just thinking about the fact that the Avengers are about to help me study for my midterm, and trying to figure out how the hell I got to this point in my life.&rdquo; A small blush spread across your cheeks at the immediate embarrassment of how dorky you sounded</p><p>Peter must have noticed, and laughed while patting you on the back. &ldquo;I ask myself that question every day. I mean, come on, man! Tony Stark came to me and wanted me to be part of his internship! How crazy is that!?&rdquo; He exclaimed.</p><p>Tony smirked. &ldquo;You got skill, kid. I&rsquo;ll give you that.&rdquo;</p><p>He walked over and grabbed both of your back packs and pulled them to a larger table near the center of the room.<br />&ldquo;Short break and we&rsquo;ll begin.&rdquo;</p><p>The four of you made your way to the living room area to watch some television and unwind. </p><p>Upon entering, you saw Natasha, Steve, and Clint sitting on the big L shaped couch watching some kind of mystery documentary. The three of them greeted you and Peter, and welcomed you to sit down with them. You found a spot between Steve and Natasha and sat down. Peter didn&rsquo;t seemed phased sitting there with them, but you were. You were sitting next to, allegedly, the world&rsquo;s greatest spy/ assassin, and were an arms length away from history&rsquo;s greatest science project. </p><p>Tony ordered Chinese take out, which arrived within minutes of ordering.</p><p>You sat with everyone and ate in silence, still overwhelmed by that amount of knowledge and skill in one room. You were starstruck, and somehow had to work up the never to ask Steve to help you with your homework. </p><p>After about 45 minutes of watching the episode that was on the big flat screen, Natasha gently jabbed you with her elbow.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been awfully quiet. What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p><p>You jolted at the sudden contact and looked at her. &ldquo;Oh. Uh. Nothing.&rdquo;</p><p>She uncrossed her legs and faced toward you a little more. &ldquo;Y/N,&rdquo; she stated, &ldquo;I lie for a living. You&rsquo;re going to have to do better than &lsquo;nothing&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p>You looked over at Steve, who&rsquo;s attention was still fixed on the TV, then over to Clint and Peter, who were in the middle of their own conversation on the opposite side of the couch, and lastly at Bruce, who was passed out in the recliner, then sighed. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s stupid&hellip;&rdquo; You breath.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not stupid.&rdquo; She reassured.</p><p>You inhaled deeply. &ldquo;Peter and I are studying for our midterms, and I need help with a few subjects. Dr. Banner, and Mr. Stark are going to help us with the science stuff, Peter is going to help me with math, but&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Nat&rsquo;s eyes narrowed slightly in confusion. &ldquo;But?&rdquo; She prompted.</p><p>You glanced at Steve who was still enveloped by the show. </p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark said I should ask Captain Rogers for help with history&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Steve turned his head to you and tried to hold back a smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be happy to help.&rdquo; </p><p>You jumped at his booming voice coming from behind you. Both Natasha and Steve laughed while you were a blushing mess.</p><p>Steve leaned and nudged you with his broad shoulder. <br />&ldquo;Did you really think I couldn&rsquo;t hear you talking when you&rsquo;re barely four feet away from me?&rdquo;</p><p>You continued blushing. &ldquo;I- well, you were watching tv and-&rdquo;</p><p>Steve laughed &ldquo;I may be 100 years old, but I&rsquo;m not an old man who can only focus on one thing at a time. By the way, that wasn&rsquo;t a stupid question. Don&rsquo;t put yourself down like that.&rdquo;</p><p>You awkwardly laughed. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to call you old! And uh. Thanks.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it. Technically, if we ignore the 70 some-odd years I was in the ice, I&rsquo;d be about 30.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve and you then proceeded to talk about what topics you&rsquo;ll have to cover to get an idea of what he can help you with.</p><p>After the show finished, you, Peter, Tony, and Bruce made your way back to the lab.<br />Once in there, homework and studying hit hard. </p><p>Tony and Bruce had scrap pieces of paper and showed you how the chemical equations worked step by step. After you and Peter got Chemistry down, you moved to biology and microbiology. That was more Bruce&rsquo;s field, so he showed you the different sites on the body where different bacterial infections could occur, which bacteria grow on which plate medias, what air conditions are needed for each to grow properly, and how long they need to incubate. <br />Once you finished the book work for that, Bruce pulled out a few specimens and show you how to properly plate them. Thankfully, you were a hands-on learner, so that helped you greatly.</p><p>Hours passed, and soon, the sun was setting. You and Peter gathered up your things and headed to your respective homes before curfew.</p><p>The next day, after school, you and Peter headed back to The Tower for another round of studying. You told your parents, and they were all for it. </p><p>When you both arrived, FRIDAY directed you to go to the library to meet with Steve.</p><p>Steve sat, hunched over a large, slightly browned, leather-backed book. He had on a blue and white plaid shirt that was rolled up to his elbows and a pair of dark grey, high waisted, trousers. </p><p>For some godforsaken reason, the line &ldquo;<i>I wear your grandad&rsquo;s clothes. I look incredible</i>&rdquo; played through your head, and you had to stifle back a laugh.</p><p>He looked up from his book. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s so funny?&rdquo;</p><p>You looked over at Peter who had a slightly confused expression on his face, but also somewhat smiling, knowing that whatever it was, he&rsquo;d probably laugh as well.<br />You bursted out laughing and slapped your hand over your mouth for a second so you could compose yourself.</p><p>&ldquo;The bridge towards the end of the <i>Thrift Shop</i> by Macklemore&hellip;&rdquo; You said vaguely. His brows knit together in thought, then he looked at Steve, and realization hit him hard. He laughed so hard that he fell on the ground; you laughed and doubled over with tears in your eyes.</p><p>Poor Steve was sat at the old oak table wondering why the two of you were laughing at him. He looked himself over to see what was wrong with his appearance, and you felt so bad.</p><p>After another minute of calming down, you set your things on a chair across from him and wiped the last tear that tried to escape. <br />&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not laughing at you, Captain Rogers. Your outfit reminded me of a line from a song is all.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve frowned. &ldquo;And what would that be?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter stood up and started singing &ldquo;<i>I wear your your granddad&rsquo;s clothes. I look incredible</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>You reached over and smacked Peter on the shoulder. &ldquo;Knock it off!&rdquo; </p><p>You looked at Steve and tried holding back a smile. &ldquo;Nothing is wrong with what you&rsquo;re wearing. It&rsquo;s what you wore back when you were growing up. Saying as you were born in 1918, and I was born in 2002, you&rsquo;re technically old enough to be my great, great grandfather.&rdquo; </p><p>Steve physically cringed at this information that he never needed to hear. &ldquo;Yeah okay. Great&hellip; Can we just get on with history&hellip;&rdquo; His face was still wrinkled up in mild disgust and discomfort. </p><p>To get such a reaction out of Captain America, you had a sense of pride in that.</p><p>Steve started his teaching with the Civil War. His grandfather fought in that war and kept a notebook of events and details he remembered when he was in the service. After he passed, it was passed on to Steve&rsquo;s dad, and eventually to him. Thankfully, Howard kept all of his belonging in a safe vault that was passed down to Tony. <br />Steve matched what his grandfather wrote to what was written in the older history book that was in front of him. </p><p>From there, they moved on the the first World War, which his father fought and died in. His dad wrote in a little notebook, just like his dad did, and eventually, it was passed to Steve as well&mdash; the only way to remember his dad. Again, he fact checked between what his dad wrote and what was written in the old and new textbooks.</p><p>Then they got to World War two. This topic went on forever, but neither of you minded. Steve told about the Nazi&rsquo;s, the normal factual things that would be in history book, and doing his best to avoid topics of Bucky, Peggy, Howard, and the Howling Commandos. Sometimes, he would go off on a tangent about how wonder the people in his life were, telling stories, reliving the memories, but they all lead back to either how they died or how he left them behind. Bucky was brought up quite a bit. It was obvious that he was fresh on Steve&rsquo;s mind, almost like an old wound had opened up. In those moments, you and Peter both changed the topic back to where they left off, and continued on.</p><p>Since the war didn&rsquo;t end until after he went into the ice, Steve had to rely heavily on his own research of the topic.</p><p>Hours passed, and all three of you were hungry. Steve decided that was enough for the day, so he asked if you and Peter could put away the books they pulled out before heading up to the kitchen. You read the shelves and eventually found where the one you had went. </p><p>As you turned down the correct isle, you saw Loki sitting on the windowsill, reading a book. A small yelp escaped from your throat and you jumped back. </p><p>Loki calmly looked over at you with a raised eyebrow. </p><p>Peter sprinted over to you and was about to ask what was wrong, but then he saw Loki. <br />&ldquo;Hi, Mr. Loki.&rdquo; Peter said with a nervous quiver to his voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah. Parker. How is the studying going?&rdquo;</p><p><i>How does Peter know him!?</i> You thought</p><p>Loki&rsquo;s eyes landed on you. &ldquo;He practically lives here. We were bound to meet at some point.&rdquo;</p><p>You froze in fear. <i>Did he just read my thoughts!?</i></p><p>&ldquo;Yes I did. Now that that is out of the way, yes, I will help you with literature.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How did you-&rdquo; Peter began</p><p>&ldquo;I have ears everywhere.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s eyes lit up. &ldquo;Did you use your illusions!? That would be so cool&hellip; and kind of creepy, bUT super awesome! Is this an illusion?&rdquo;</p><p>He reached out to touch him on the shoulder, but Loki smacked his hand away. <br />&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; He exclaimed, rubbing his wrist. <br />&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll be back tomorrow, meet me here in the library and we will begin the lesson.&rdquo; Loki looked back down to his book as if neither of you were there, seemingly willing it into existence.</p><p>You and Peter exchanged a look and set off to the kitchen, where you grabbed something quick to eat before heading home for the evening.</p><p>It was finally Friday. This was the third day in a row where you got to go to Stark Towers, or now the Avengers Towers. You were surprised how human they all were- well, all except Loki. Of course you knew they were humans, but they were also superheros. They are idolized, and only the craziest headlines and stories show up on social media and the news. You never hear &ldquo;Sam Wilson and Steve Rogers go to the grocery store&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Natasha Romanoff and Wanda Maximoff go to the movies&rdquo;, therefore never getting a sense of how &ldquo;normal&rdquo; they are. </p><p>On the way to the Tower, you and Peter grabbed some street hot dogs and made your way to the library, knowing it was going to be another long afternoon.</p><p>Upon entering the room, you saw Loki sitting at the oak table; Not one, but four; one sat on each side of the table with a different book. </p><p>&ldquo;Holy shit!&rdquo; You and Peter exclaimed simultaneously. His was said in awe and admiration. Yours was said in shock and possibly fear.</p><p>All four of them looked at you and grinned before three disappeared into a small cloud of green and gold shimmer. </p><p>&ldquo;That is so cool!&rdquo; Peter said excitedly, completely awestruck by his magic.</p><p>You were also impressed, but you were much more observant. &ldquo;Wait. Since all four of you were reading different books, and they are all you, does that mean you literally just read four books at the same time!?&rdquo;</p><p>Loki chuckled lowly. &ldquo;Clever girl. You&rsquo;re not as dumb as you think you are. There is hope for you to learn yet. Sit and we shall begin.&rdquo;</p><p>You were shocked by his words, but he wasn&rsquo;t wrong. You never thought you were the smartest. You barely scraped by in your classes and struggled learning the material presented to you. Clever is not the word you would have described yourself as.</p><p>Peter sat in the seat adjacent to him and look him with mild confusion across his face. &ldquo;Why did you agree to help us?&rdquo;</p><p>You sat down adjacent to Peter and across from Loki, waiting for his response. </p><p>He exhaled sharply and looked at Peter. &ldquo;To be quite honest, you&rsquo;re the only ones here who not only treats me normally, but takes interest in what I have to say.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter blinked at him. &ldquo;Well, you did try to take over my city and killed many innocent people, but I trusted Thor when he told me that you weren&rsquo;t like that. You lie and deceive, but you&rsquo;ve never been one to do all of that taking over stuff, so I decided to give you a chance, and you&rsquo;re actually pretty cool.&rdquo;</p><p>Loki smirked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take that as a complement.&rdquo;</p><p>You all started on Shakespeare&rsquo;s Macbeth, one of Loki&rsquo;s favorites. As you all read out loud, taking turns, Loki translated old English into modern terms so you two could more easily understand. At a certain point, Loki got sick of you two stuttering and mispronouncing words, and took over reading the rest of the book/ play. It was so pleasant to the ears to hear his deep voice effortlessly read the text with perfect inflection and subtle voice acting. The pair of you filled out answers to your homework sheet as he read and took notes so that you could write your essay easier. </p><p>&ldquo;Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen, who, as &lsquo;tis thought, by self and violent hands took off her life; this, and what needful else that calls upon us, by the grace of Grace, we will perform in measure, time and place: So, thanks to all at once and to each one, whom we invite to see us crown&rsquo;d at Scone. End.&rdquo;</p><p>You and Peter set down your books and clapped enthusiastically while Loki faked a bow from his seat.</p><p>&ldquo;Any questions?&rdquo; He said with a slight smug look on his face. </p><p>You smiled at him. &ldquo;Not right now, but next week, I&rsquo;d like to do this again.&rdquo; You said at Loki, but also addressing Peter.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah! This was great. Thank you, Mr. Loki. Next week, we just need to focus on going over the material from the semester, and we should be good to go.&rdquo; Peter added.</p><p>That being said, it was exactly what the two of you did. You came back the following week on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday with Peter and continued on with your studying&mdash; Monday with Bruce and Tony, Wednesday with Steve, and Friday with Loki. Tuesday was set aside for you and Peter to help you get the math down, which thankfully didn&rsquo;t take too long.</p><p>You kept your nose to the books and rewrote notes, read them out loud, and were unafraid to ask any questions you may have had.</p><p>A few weeks later, was midterms week. Luckily, it was all done on the computer so you got your results immediately. Once you submitted your last exam on the last day of testing, you left the room, waiting for your friends. </p><p>One by one, MJ, Ned, and Peter trickled out of the room. All of you passed, and you had to do everything in your power not to squeal like a schoolgirl. You surprised yourself.</p><p>When school ended, you were about to head to the bus when a black car pulled up in front of you four and unrolled the window. </p><p>Happy Hogan was in the driver&rsquo;s seat. &ldquo;Peter, Y/N, Mr. Stark would like to see you both.&rdquo; He said very plainly. MJ and Ned looked at each other, then at you two. You felt bad that they weren&rsquo;t invited to go with you, but you also understood that if more people from the school started going to Stark Towers, the whole school would be wanting to go as well.</p><p>Both you and Peter must have felt the same way because the two of you looked at the other pair in an apologetic way.</p><p>MJ was the one to speak first. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stand here staring at us. Go!&rdquo; </p><p>Peter smiled at her and hopped in. Happy got out and held the door for you, to which you thanked him.</p><p>Once you arrived at the Towers, you were directed to go to the kitchen. Peter entered first and flicked on the lights.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Congratulations!&rdquo; A symphony of voices yelled.&nbsp;</p><p>Tony, Bruce, Nat, Clint, Wanda, Vision, Steve, and even Loki all stood around the island, which had a large sheet cake in the middle.</p><p>Tony walked over and slapped a cheap, cone shaped party hat on both of your heads. &ldquo;You passed. No, you didn&rsquo;t just pass, you both got all A&rsquo;s and a few B&rsquo;s on all of your exams! That calls for celebration.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How did you know that?&rdquo; You said, still a little in shock from the surprise. </p><p>Nat chuckled &ldquo;I can hack into government computers. You don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d be able to tap into a high school&rsquo;s student records?&rdquo; .</p><p>Peter stepped forward. &ldquo;This is nice and all, but you do realize this was just a midterm, right? This wasn&rsquo;t even for the whole school year. This wasn&rsquo;t a graduation exam or anything.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve smiled. &ldquo;Celebrate the small victories. You both did great. You took your studies seriously and did everything you could to do more than just pass. That is what we&rsquo;re truly celebrating. This is especially for you, Y/N. We all noticed how you talked down about yourself, calling yourself dumb, and stupid, but look at you! You got some of the highest grades in your class! We&rsquo;re all so proud of you.&rdquo;</p><p>You teared up at his sweet words, but couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh. He sounded just like one of those dumb Captain America PSA&rsquo;s, but this one was so heartfelt and genuine. </p><p>Clint went to punch Steve on the shoulder, but it looked like he punched a brick wall with how little Steve moved, but he carried on anyway. &ldquo;Enough with the mush. Cake time!&rdquo; </p><p>Everyone gathered around as Clint cut unequally sized pieces and handed them to everyone, even Loki who turned up his nose at the Midgardian celebratory sweet. </p><p>The afternoon/ evening was spent talking and laughing with everyone gathered in the living room; conversation ranging anywhere from unclassified past missions, to what everyone&rsquo;s high school experience was, to what your plans were for the short winter break. </p><p>As the sun set, you and Peter said your goodbyes to the team, hoping to see them again in a couple weeks after vacation, but you never did. </p><p>News blew up towards the end of winter break about &ldquo;The Winter Soldier&rdquo; again, having reappeared since the last attack on New York. Once school was back in session, Peter seemed a bit shaken up. You, Ned, and MJ tried talking it out of him, but he didn&rsquo;t budge. A week or so back in class, more news came up about the Avengers signing some kind of Accords. The next day, Peter didn&rsquo;t show up to school; no call, no show, just gone. </p><p>Watching the Avengers be pit against each other hurt. Tony against Steve, Nat against Clint, Wanda against Vision. It felt almost like a divorce. You hurt for them, and knew that Peter hurt for them too. You chalked up his absence from school as him mourning the divorce of his extended family, but you pushed on, because no matter what tried to get in your way, you remembered all of the lessons that everyone there taught you. More importantly, you learned to have faith in your mind, your abilities, and yourself. </p>",
