They are saying you\u2019re indeed a prince. Oh, you must look so great in those Prince costume. Do you think Disney will really consider it?\u201d You couldn\u2019t help but started your whole fangirl rambling about the news.</p><p>\u201cHow about the Snow White? Who do they choose for Snow White? You?\u201d Chris sat next to you on the couch after he got two cups of coffee for you two.</p><p>\u201cNah. I\u2019m not eligible for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense! No one would be eligible then!\u201d He jokingly said as his tone sounded like he was defending you. However, the jealousy and more importantly, the self-doubt made you kinda blind.</p><p>\u201cHow about Collin?\u201d You handed him your phone so to show him the post that you\u2019re reading and he took your phone, \u201cI think you two will really make a good couple.\u201d You smiled at him bitterly when you said so.</p><p>Chris only took a brief glance at your phone before he put your phone on the coffee table and took your hands in his instead.</p><p>\u201cY/n, stop thinking about it! You would only be my Snow White, my one and only Snow White. If things have worked out between me and Collin, I will not be here. And now, obviously, I\u2019m with you and there\u2019s no way I would let you go! Remember what I\u2019ve said before, y/n, <a href=\"https://mschrisaholic.tumblr.com/post/185110193317/ill-only-let-go-if-you-do\">I\u2019ll only let go if you do</a>. (P.S. this plot goes to my another work!) If you\u2019re not being Snow White with me, then Disney is not having me as the prince! Not to mention that I don\u2019t think they are really thinking about finding me cause I\u2019m too old to be a prince.\u201d He first stared at you lovingly and then giggled at his \u201cold\u201d joke, trying to lighten up your mood.</p><p>You heard what Chris said and it comforted you as always. You threw your arms around his neck and laid your head on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry that I always think that I don\u2019t deserve you. I just can\u2019t help. Thank you for always being with me whenever I doubt myself.\u201d You said then you pecked his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a fool! A fool that doubts yourself and thanks your boyfriend for being there for you!\u201d He returned your peck with a kiss on your lips.</p><p>You two stayed on the couch and snuggled for the following hours, doing nothing but only drinking coffee and watching Disney movies. Before \u201cMoana\u201d ended, you fell asleep sitting on Chris\u2019s lap and your head lying</p><p>At nearly 3, Chris\u2019s phone rang. He looked at the screen, realized it\u2019s from Downey. Then, he stared at you and realized you were stirring a bit because of the noise from the phone. He sneaked out from the couch and picked up the phone at the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cHey, Downey!&ldquo;</p><p>\u201cHi, Evans! What takes you so long? I am thinking you\u2019re not gonna answer my call.&rdquo;</p><p>\u201cOh, I would be out of my mind if I don\u2019t pick up the greatest RDJ\u2019s call. Y/n is sleeping, I don\u2019t wanna wake her up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! Being a caring boyfriend here, I see. Anyway, I\u2019m throwing a costume party tonight! You and Y/n have 5 hours to get ready! The theme is Disney, which is your favorite. Do you get me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy so sudden, Downey? I\u2019m not complaining, of course, just wondering.\u201d Chris slightly chuckled of RDJ\u2019s idea of throwing a costume party themed on Disney.</p><p>\u201cWell, no reasons at all. I\u2019m just being a random person as always! See you two tonight, my dear! I\u2019ve tried to invite as many of the Avengers as I can. Okay, I\u2019m gonna call others now! You know my address in LA. Bye, Evans!\u201d RDJ blew Chris a kiss through the screen before he hung up the phone.</p><p>Chris walked back to the couch where you were sleeping on, he saw your sleeping face and gave a peck on your forehead. He had already got something in mind and he wrote a note and put it on the coffee table before he took the car key and left the house.</p><p>\u201cHey, sleepyhead!\u201d You were wakened by Chris once he got back and shook your body slightly.</p><p>\u201cMmm\u2026Chris? Oh god, how long did I sleep?\u201d You rubbed your eyes while you asked him.</p><p>\u201cLong enough for me to go out and buy what we need for tonight\u2019s party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cParty? What party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, RDJ is currently in LA for filming and he is throwing a costume party with the theme of Disney tonight. Of course, we are invited!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Costume party? Then what should I wear? Oh god, you should wake me up! Now I have nothing to wear for the party!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ve already prepared it for you!\u201d Chris said and then handed you a costume before he urged you to change it upstairs.</p><p>After you changed the costume and put on some make up, you went downstairs and saw that Chris was in his costume too.</p><p>\u201cWhy Snow White?\u201d You stretched your hands and turned around in front of Chris.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t wike it?\u201d Chris in his Prince Ferdinand costume asked.</p><p>\u201cI love it, just wonder why it\u2019s Snow White but not your favorite Little Mermaid.&ldquo;</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what princess you\u2019re, it only matters whose princess you\u2019re. The answer is you\u2019re forever my princess. Only I can tell that you\u2019re eligible or not, and you\u2019re the only one who\u2019s always eligible.\u201d Chris told you as he stared at you so deeply and showed you how much he loves you.</p><p>You could feel his love of course and his words just made some tears brimming in your eyes. All you could do is to throw your arms around his neck and left a lipstick mark on his face.</p><p>\u2014 At RDJ\u2019s party &ndash;</p><p>\u201cHere come Prince Evans and his one and only Snow White!\u201d RDJ said so as he opened the door for you and Chris to get inside. He gave you two a big hug.</p><p>\u201cHi, Downey! I miss you so much! Thank for inviting us here!&rdquo;</p><p>\u201cOh, dear. You have no idea how much I miss you since the wrapping up of the Avengers! I know you would never say no for a party with the theme of Disney!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Robert. I would never say no to all of your parties!\u201d You said to RDJ with a wide smile broke on your face.</p><p>\u201cWell, go and have some drinks before the DJ plays you some songs to do slow dancing.\u201d RDJ led you and Chris to the bar area of his house before he went to find Susan.</p><p>Chris ordered your favorite cocktail from the bar and you two started to chat before the DJ played the emotional songs.</p><p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019m not old enough to drink in this Snow White costume, considering Snow White is only 14.&ldquo;</p><p>Chris laughed as he grabbed his left boob. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hilarious, babe. That\u2019s why I love you so much!\u201d He leaned down and kissed you.

English is not my first language, so please do forgive me if I make any mistakes, which I am so sure that there are some in my writing;)) Enjoy~</p><p><a href=\"https://mschrisaholic.tumblr.com/post/184802401782/my-masterlist\"><b><i>My Masterlist</i></b></a></p><p><b>He is like a prince when he dresses like this in this GIF;)</b></p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>&mdash; At your shared house &mdash;</p><p>You were scrolling those social media and saw some news about your boyfriend. </p><p>&ldquo;Chris, the fans are saying that you should be the prince in Snow White. They are saying you&rsquo;re indeed a prince. Oh, you must look so great in those Prince costume. Do you think Disney will really consider it?&rdquo; You couldn&rsquo;t help but started your whole fangirl rambling about the news.</p><p>&ldquo;How about the Snow White? Who do they choose for Snow White? You?&rdquo; Chris sat next to you on the couch after he got two cups of coffee for you two.</p><p>&ldquo;Nah. I&rsquo;m not eligible for it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nonsense! No one would be eligible then!&rdquo; He jokingly said as his tone sounded like he was defending you. However, the jealousy and more importantly, the self-doubt made you kinda blind.</p><p>&ldquo;How about Collin?&rdquo; You handed him your phone so to show him the post that you&rsquo;re reading and he took your phone, &ldquo;I think you two will really make a good couple.&rdquo; You smiled at him bitterly when you said so.</p><p>Chris only took a brief glance at your phone before he put your phone on the coffee table and took your hands in his instead.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/n, stop thinking about it! You would only be my Snow White, my one and only Snow White. If things have worked out between me and Collin, I will not be here. And now, obviously, I&rsquo;m with you and there&rsquo;s no way I would let you go! Remember what I&rsquo;ve said before, y/n, <a href=\"https://mschrisaholic.tumblr.com/post/185110193317/ill-only-let-go-if-you-do\">I&rsquo;ll only let go if you do</a>. (P.S. this plot goes to my another work!) If you&rsquo;re not being Snow White with me, then Disney is not having me as the prince! Not to mention that I don&rsquo;t think they are really thinking about finding me cause I&rsquo;m too old to be a prince.&rdquo; He first stared at you lovingly and then giggled at his &ldquo;old&rdquo; joke, trying to lighten up your mood.</p><p>You heard what Chris said and it comforted you as always. You threw your arms around his neck and laid your head on his shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry that I always think that I don&rsquo;t deserve you. I just can&rsquo;t help. Thank you for always being with me whenever I doubt myself.&rdquo; You said then you pecked his cheeks.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re such a fool! A fool that doubts yourself and thanks your boyfriend for being there for you!&rdquo; He returned your peck with a kiss on your lips.</p><p>You two stayed on the couch and snuggled for the following hours, doing nothing but only drinking coffee and watching Disney movies. Before &ldquo;Moana&rdquo; ended, you fell asleep sitting on Chris&rsquo;s lap and your head lying</p><p>At nearly 3, Chris&rsquo;s phone rang. He looked at the screen, realized it&rsquo;s from Downey. Then, he stared at you and realized you were stirring a bit because of the noise from the phone. He sneaked out from the couch and picked up the phone at the kitchen.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Downey!&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hi, Evans! What takes you so long? I am thinking you&rsquo;re not gonna answer my call.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I would be out of my mind if I don&rsquo;t pick up the greatest RDJ&rsquo;s call. Y/n is sleeping, I don&rsquo;t wanna wake her up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! Being a caring boyfriend here, I see. Anyway, I&rsquo;m throwing a costume party tonight! You and Y/n have 5 hours to get ready! The theme is Disney, which is your favorite. Do you get me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why so sudden, Downey? I&rsquo;m not complaining, of course, just wondering.&rdquo; Chris slightly chuckled of RDJ&rsquo;s idea of throwing a costume party themed on Disney.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, no reasons at all. I&rsquo;m just being a random person as always! See you two tonight, my dear! I&rsquo;ve tried to invite as many of the Avengers as I can. Okay, I&rsquo;m gonna call others now! You know my address in LA. Bye, Evans!&rdquo; RDJ blew Chris a kiss through the screen before he hung up the phone.</p><p>Chris walked back to the couch where you were sleeping on, he saw your sleeping face and gave a peck on your forehead. He had already got something in mind and he wrote a note and put it on the coffee table before he took the car key and left the house.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, sleepyhead!&rdquo; You were wakened by Chris once he got back and shook your body slightly.</p><p>&ldquo;Mmm&hellip;Chris? Oh god, how long did I sleep?&rdquo; You rubbed your eyes while you asked him.</p><p>&ldquo;Long enough for me to go out and buy what we need for tonight&rsquo;s party.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Party? What party?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, RDJ is currently in LA for filming and he is throwing a costume party with the theme of Disney tonight. Of course, we are invited!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What? Costume party? Then what should I wear? Oh god, you should wake me up! Now I have nothing to wear for the party!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. I&rsquo;ve already prepared it for you!&rdquo; Chris said and then handed you a costume before he urged you to change it upstairs.</p><p>After you changed the costume and put on some make up, you went downstairs and saw that Chris was in his costume too.</p><p>&ldquo;Why Snow White?&rdquo; You stretched your hands and turned around in front of Chris.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t wike it?&rdquo; Chris in his Prince Ferdinand costume asked.</p><p>&ldquo;I love it, just wonder why it&rsquo;s Snow White but not your favorite Little Mermaid.&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter what princess you&rsquo;re, it only matters whose princess you&rsquo;re. The answer is you&rsquo;re forever my princess. Only I can tell that you&rsquo;re eligible or not, and you&rsquo;re the only one who&rsquo;s always eligible.&rdquo; Chris told you as he stared at you so deeply and showed you how much he loves you.</p><p>You could feel his love of course and his words just made some tears brimming in your eyes. All you could do is to throw your arms around his neck and left a lipstick mark on his face.</p><p>&mdash; At RDJ&rsquo;s party &ndash;</p><p>&ldquo;Here come Prince Evans and his one and only Snow White!&rdquo; RDJ said so as he opened the door for you and Chris to get inside. He gave you two a big hug.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi, Downey! I miss you so much! Thank for inviting us here!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, dear. You have no idea how much I miss you since the wrapping up of the Avengers! I know you would never say no for a party with the theme of Disney!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Robert. I would never say no to all of your parties!&rdquo; You said to RDJ with a wide smile broke on your face.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, go and have some drinks before the DJ plays you some songs to do slow dancing.&rdquo; RDJ led you and Chris to the bar area of his house before he went to find Susan.</p><p>Chris ordered your favorite cocktail from the bar and you two started to chat before the DJ played the emotional songs.</p><p>&ldquo;I feel like I&rsquo;m not old enough to drink in this Snow White costume, considering Snow White is only 14.&ldquo;</p><p>Chris laughed as he grabbed his left boob. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re hilarious, babe. That&rsquo;s why I love you so much!&rdquo; He leaned down and kissed you. You could taste the smell of Vodka when you two were kissing.</p><p>Once you two finished your drinks, the DJ finally played some slow songs and Chris stretched out his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;May I, overgrown Snow White?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, dear prince. You&rsquo;re lucky that I&rsquo;m nice enough to say yes even you&rsquo;ve called me overgrown.&rdquo; You put your hand in his as you said yes.</p><p>Then, Chris and you danced along with the songs, nothing had stopped your feet, no matter the songs were fast or slow.</p><p>Later that night, RDJ sent you back some photos that he took while you and Chris were dancing. You&rsquo;re in Chris&rsquo;s arms and you two smiled so widely to each other.</p><p>Chris posted the photo of you two on his only social media, Twitter, with the caption, &ldquo;Prince Evans and his one and only Snow White, &#65532;@y&#65532;/n. Waiting for her to finally become an adult so that the prince can marry her. Even without the certificate now, these two can already picture their future of living happily ever after.&rdquo;</p><p>You saw his post while you were sitting between his legs, you tilted up your head and smiled at him before you retweeted his post, saying &ldquo;Dear prince, age is really just a number. Moreover, there&rsquo;s no need for waiting cause you&rsquo;ve just called me overgrown and indeed I am.&rdquo;</p>",
