You had initially taken a seat in one of the arm chairs, but before the film had started, Tony had pulled you over to the couch to sit beside him.</p> <p>He had grabbed one of the throw blankets and laid it across the two of you as he pulled you cozily into his side. He rested his arm on the back of the couch and lazily played with your hair, gently massaging your scalp with his finger tips.</p> <p>Peter sat on the floor in front of the couch on the other side of Tony\u2019s legs, eyes glued to the action film the entire time. Bucky, Steve, and Sam each took up a sofa sack towards the front of the room, while Wanda curled up in one of the arm chairs.</p> <p>The room was dark, lit only by the light of the flat screen TV, and the two of you had the couch to yourselves. Halfway through the film, Tony had grown completely bored of the movie and had turned all of his attention to you. He had moved his hand to your shoulder, his thumb softly rubbing the small bit of exposed skin of your collarbone, and placed soft, quiet kisses to your head.</p> <p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he whispered in your ear, so soft that only you could hear. He nudged you with his nose, encouraging him to look at you. With every touch of his fingertips and every soft kiss he had pressed on you, the butterflies in your stomach had fluttered, but when you finally turned your face towards him they burst into full flight.</p> <p>A sweet smirk teased the edges of his mouth as he bit his bottom lip, and his gaze danced between your eyes and your lips. In the weeks that had passed since he\u2019d admitted that he liked you, the two of you had only kissed briefly a few times, as you hardly had the time to be alone between jobs and missions.</p> <p>He leaned in and kissed you, softly at first to test the waters. But soon, he lost himself in it, and was instinctively pulling you closer to him while the kiss built in passion. You followed your own desires and sunk into the kiss, and within minutes you the two of you were making out with you halfway in his lap while the rest of the room was entirely oblivious to anything but the movie.</p> <p>All at once you became equally aware of how pleasantly your body was reacting to his touch and how you actually had no idea what you were doing, and the knowledge of the latter fact echoed in your head, causing every nervous fiber in your body to freeze. You immediately broke the kiss, and fell back into the couch and off of his lap.</p> <p>\u201cUh, I gotta go, um, check some emails,\u201d you murmured as you tossed the blanket off your lap and clumsily jumped up off the couch to rush to your room.</p> <p>You closed the door behind you and immediately threw yourself face first onto the bed, burying your face in your pillow. You let out a long, muffled groan and internally cursed yourself for panicking.</p> <p>All you wanted was to kiss Tony. Everytime you looked at him, all you wanted was him. Even before he had confessed his feelings for you, all you thought about was him, and you spent all your time imagining what it would be like for him to like you, to hold you, to kiss you, to\u2026</p> <p>You lifted your head up out of the pillow when there was a soft knock at your door.</p> <p>\u201c<i>Please don\u2019t be Tony, please don\u2019t be Tony, please don\u2019t be Tony,</i>\u201d you whispered to yourself as you approached the door.</p> <p>You\u2019d spent months wondering what would happen, what you would do if he ever showed up at your door, but now you had probably ruined any chance of it being anything good, and he was the last person you wanted to face.</p> <p>\u201cTony,\u201d you said awkwardly with a half-forced smile when you found him on the other side of your door.</p> <p>\u201cWhat did I do wrong?\u201d he asked immediately.</p> <p>\u201cWhat? Oh, nothing! I just- emails, you know?\u201d You stammered with a forced laugh, embarrassed that he was blaming himself for your trepidation.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t know, babe,\u201d he said, \u201cYou\u2019re notorious for staying on top of your work, so you wouldn\u2019t be behind on your emails, and who would be emailing you at midnight on a Saturday? I did something wrong. What did I do wrong?\u201d</p> <p><i>Babe</i>. He called you \u2018babe\u2019. He had called you \u2018beautiful\u2019 on occasion when he was flirting with you when you first joined the team, but by his reputation you knew you certainly weren\u2019t the first, and aside from that he had only ever called you by your name, which still sounded sweet enough on his lips. But \u2018babe\u2019&hellip; that made your heart skip a beat. </p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong, I promise,\u201d you sighed as you walked away from the door frame and leaned back against your desk. You stared at your feet and chewed on your lip, trying to find the words to explain how you felt.</p> <p>You heard the door click shut, and soon Tony stood in front of you with his arms crossed. He nudged your foot with his to get you to look up at him.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it, then? If you don\u2019t like me, I get it. I won\u2019t blame you,\u201d he said softly, \u201cJust tell me so I don\u2019t get my hopes up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d you nearly shouted, terrified that he\u2019d think you were anything less than head-over-heels for him, \u201cI like you! A lot!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen what is it?\u201d he pleaded, taking a step closer to you.</p> <p>\u201cThis is my first\u2026\u201d you sighed, struggling to find the right word, not knowing if relationship was exactly what it was yet, as you hadn\u2019t exactly become \u2018official\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cOh! Shit! I had no idea, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he said, his eyes wide with surprise and regret, \u201cthat wasn\u2019t at all what I was trying to do back there- I mean, that would\u2019ve been great if it turned into that- but that wasn\u2019t my intention! I just really wanted to kiss you. I really like kissing you. But I\u2019m sorry if you felt like you had to- we don\u2019t have to do that if you\u2019re not ready! We can wait, or not do it at all, or whatever you want! Really, I-\u201d</p> <p>\u201c<i>Tony</i>!\u201d you interrupted, the flush of your cheeks turning as red as his Iron Man suit, \u201cthat\u2019s not what I meant! I mean, that\u2019s part of it, but that\u2019s not specifically what I meant.\u201d</p> <p>He took a tiny step back, his brow knitting in confusion. \u201cYou\u2019re losing me here, babe. What do you mean?\u201d</p> <p>You took a deep breath and organized the words in your head before stating them, wanting to finally be as honest and as clear as possible.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been in a relationship.\u201d</p> <p>You saw his expression change and his eyes widen again as he took in the words you said and finally understood what you meant.</p> <p>\u201cOhhh,\u201d he said, \u201cwait, really?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut\u2026 how?\u201d he said, tilting his head as confusion washed over him again, \u201cYou\u2019re gorgeous, you\u2019re brilliant, you\u2019re funny\u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I just\u2026 never really had the time, and when I did have the time, if I even found someone I actually I liked, I didn\u2019t have the confidence to try. I\u2019ve kissed like, three guys, but they weren\u2019t real kisses. One was during the only round of spin the bottle I ever played in high school, one was when I was drunk on my 21st birthday, and one was to get out of a dodgy situation on a mission.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you do like me?\u201d he asked curiously.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d you insisted, \u201ca lot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo, if you like me, and you know I like you too- so much, by the way, so so much- then what\u2019s the issue here?\u201d</p> <p>You dropped your gaze to your feet again, afraid of being so vulnerable with someone for the first time, especially with someone whos reputation makes your insecurities that much harder to ignore.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2026 I just get nervous,\u201d you whispered, \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing. I don\u2019t know how to be flirty or sexy or intimate. This is all new to me. Even just making out with you is new to me. I\u2019m just terrified of doing something stupid or wrong or just messing up, especially with someone like you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike me?\u201d he whispered, hesitantly taking another tiny step closer to you.</p> <p>\u201cSomeone with your reputation. Your\u2026 experience,\u201d you sighed, \u201cI can\u2019t match up to that.\u201d</p> <p>He let out a quiet laugh as he uncrossed his arms and delicately placed his hands on your hips, closing most of the distance that was left between the two of you. You looked up at him, hoping that the tears that threatened to break the surface didn\u2019t show, but the soft smile on his lips warmed your frozen nerves.</p> <p>\u201cFirst off, I don\u2019t want you to flirt with me. I want you to be yourself with me. Secondly, you are the sexiest woman I have ever laid eyes on,\u201d he smirked, \u201cand did I mention mention that you\u2019re gorgeous? And brilliant? And funny? I know I have a reputation, I know that. But the moment I met you, I wished that I could take all of that back, because I realized that all of my time had been wasted. None of them compared to you, babe. Not a damn one. I just want you, babe, in whatever ways you\u2019ll have me.\u201d</p> <p>As hard as you had fought against them, a few tears managed to escape and roll down your cheeks, but instead of insecurity, these were out of relief. You let out a laugh as you wiped them away, and then confidently wrapped your arms around his neck.</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d you sniffled.</p> <p>\u201cOkay?\u201d he grinned, resting his forehead against yours.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m wanna try,\u201d you smiled, \u201cI\u2019m not promising I won\u2019t get nervous, and I\u2019m not saying I don\u2019t want to take it slow, but I do want to try. And I want you&hellip; in a few different ways\u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally,\u201d he cooed, giving your hips a soft squeeze as he relished in how effortlessly you made him feel like the luckiest man alive, \u201cand what ways are those, exactly?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, for starters\u2026\u201d</p> <p>You mustered every ounce of confidence you could find in yourself, and then leaned up and kissed him. Slowly, but surely, and without pulling back. Your fingers toyed with the hair at the nape of his neck as he sunk into the kiss, moaning quietly against your lips.</p> <p>Just as your hands began to wander down to his chest and one of his hands traveled down to softly grab your ass, he let out a heavy exhale as he broke the kiss.</p> <p>\u201cSlow,\u201d he stated with a smirk, more as a reminder to himself than to you, \u201cHow about this. You get some sleep, and then you and I are going to spend the day together. We\u2019ll go do all of the cheesy, cliche couple-y things. I\u2019m going to give you the full boyfriend experience.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo is that what you are?\u201d You teased.</p> <p>\u201cWell I certainly hope so\u2026\u201d he said, feigning offense that you\u2019d think otherwise, earning a giggle out of you.</p> <p>\u201cSo, tomorrow?\u201d You confirmed.</p> <p>\u201cTomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>He placed a quick kiss to your lips and then one to the tip of your nose, and then turned and headed for the door. You followed him and held it open for him.</p> <p>\u201cWait,\u201d he said, turning on his heel just after he stepped into the hallway, \u201cyou said you kissed someone on a mission. Who?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUhhh, don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d you giggled, quickly shutting the door in his face and locking it. You leaned your back against the door for a second with an uncontrollable smile on your face and a new-found confidence in your new relationship.</p> <p>And just when you were about to walk away and head to bed, you could\u2019ve sworn you heard Tony grumble \u201cI swear to god, if it was Steve\u2026\u201d as he walked away, throwing you into a whole new state of panic.</p> <p><b>MASTERLIST</b></p> <p><b>TAGGED:</b> <br/><br/>@totheendofthelinepal <br/>@locke-writes <br/>@rogersxbarnesx <br/>@bbbarneswrites <br/>@harley-dent <br/>@sebbytrash <br/>@i-less-than-three-you <br/>@aenna-4 <br/>@litterally-trash <br/>@belleetlabeast <br/>@stormy-thomas <br/>@becausefanfictionthough <br/>@sebaestans <br/>@fab-notfat <br/>@shieldagentofthemonth <br/>@spnfandommademeamoose <br/>@hellomissmabel <br/>@lovely-geek <br/>@allinhishands <br/>@majestic-squad <br/>@happelu970 <br/>@7minutes-tomidnight <br/>@-supernatural-coffee-llama <br/>@angel34jolly-blog <br/>@feelmyroarrrr  <br/>@dearthofequanimity <br/>@lbouvet <br/>@takemetothefictionalworld <br/>@thesmolbear <br/>@avengerofyourheart <br/>@laurenwhitehouse-blog <br/>@beccaanne814-blog <br/>@melonberri <br/>@lostinspace33 <br/>@fangirl1029 <br/>@ryverpenrad <br/>@angryschnauzer <br/>@lovelyladylilac <br/>@bellenuit45 <br/>@knittingknerdy <br/>@the-real-tony-stank <br/>@castielohcastiel <br/>@ijustwanttobepartofyourworld <br/>@eyeofdionysus <br/>@buckyhawk <br/>@oinchavengewho <br/>@whatsbetterthanfantasy <br/>@diving-down-to-wonderland <br/>@ianbewiild <br/>@pixierox101  <br/>@marvel-ous-fics  <br/>@devilstrip <br/>@girl-next-door-writes <br/>@nikkitia7 <br/>@flowercrownsandmetallicarms <br/>@jaybird6232 <br/>@crownie-sr <br/>@crazychick010 <br/>@tinacuppy <br/>@buckybarnesisalittleshit <br/>@fantasticallyabnormal <br/>@popsicle863 <br/>@bwozzler <br/>@bellastellaluna <br/>@sebbeanstan <br/>@divide-supermarketflowers <br/>@secondstartotheright-imagines <br/>@aesthetic-bbygoats  <br/>@just-another-fangirl777 <br/>@shieldagentofthemonth <br/>@broken-pieces <br/>@its-onepiece <br/>@little-lord <br/>@strawberrybucky <br/>@lovelyfuckingcunt <br/>@4theluvofall <br/>@txcountrybelle <br/>@ginasellsbooks  <br/>@phasma-trash <br/>@thevanishedillusion  <br/>@magnitude101999 <br/>@lady-thor-foster <br/>@power-of-god-and-anime <br/>@volcanicchoas <br/>@a-watson-in-search-of-a-sherlock <br/>@olivelongnprosper <br/>@yourwonderbelle <br/>@neeadinghugs <br/>@odinhson <br/>@dafnekeenfblog <br/>@thinkwritexpress-official <br/>@vethrvolnir <br/>@wildefire <br/>@heartssick <br/>@riddikulus-obsessions <br/>@cudan2 <br/>@metalarmlover <br/>@jaegers-and-kaijus <br/>@pandamambo5<i> <br/>@bookscoffeeandracoons <br/>@katelynkargol <br/>@stonedxsoldier\n\n</i> <br/></p> <p><b>If you would like to be tagged or removed, or if I forgot anyone, please let me know &lt;3</b></p>",

I won\u2019t blame you,\u201d he said softly, \u201cJust tell me so I don\u2019t get my hopes up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d you nearly shouted, terrified that he\u2019d think you were anything less than head-over-heels for him, \u201cI like you! A lot!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen what is it?\u201d he pleaded, taking a step closer to you.</p> <p>\u201cThis is my first\u2026\u201d you sighed, struggling to find the right word, not knowing if relationship was exactly what it was yet, as you hadn\u2019t exactly become \u2018official\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cOh! Shit! I had no idea, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he said, his eyes wide with surprise and regret, \u201cthat wasn\u2019t at all what I was trying to do back there- I mean, that would\u2019ve been great if it turned into that- but that wasn\u2019t my intention! I just really wanted to kiss you. I really like kissing you. But I\u2019m sorry if you felt like you had to- we don\u2019t have to do that if you\u2019re not ready! We can wait, or not do it at all, or whatever you want! Really, I-\u201d</p> <p>\u201c<i>Tony</i>!\u201d you interrupted, the flush of your cheeks turning as red as his Iron Man suit, \u201cthat\u2019s not what I meant! I mean, that\u2019s part of it, but that\u2019s not specifically what I meant.\u201d</p> <p>He took a tiny step back, his brow knitting in confusion. \u201cYou\u2019re losing me here, babe. What do you mean?\u201d</p> <p>You took a deep breath and organized the words in your head before stating them, wanting to finally be as honest and as clear as possible.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been in a relationship.\u201d</p> <p>You saw his expression change and his eyes widen again as he took in the words you said and finally understood what you meant.</p> <p>\u201cOhhh,\u201d he said, \u201cwait, really?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut\u2026 how?\u201d he said, tilting his head as confusion washed over him again, \u201cYou\u2019re gorgeous, you\u2019re brilliant, you\u2019re funny\u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I just\u2026 never really had the time, and when I did have the time, if I even found someone I actually I liked, I didn\u2019t have the confidence to try. I\u2019ve kissed like, three guys, but they weren\u2019t real kisses. One was during the only round of spin the bottle I ever played in high school, one was when I was drunk on my 21st birthday, and one was to get out of a dodgy situation on a mission.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you do like me?\u201d he asked curiously.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d you insisted, \u201ca lot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo, if you like me, and you know I like you too- so much, by the way, so so much- then what\u2019s the issue here?\u201d</p> <p>You dropped your gaze to your feet again, afraid of being so vulnerable with someone for the first time, especially with someone whos reputation makes your insecurities that much harder to ignore.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2026 I just get nervous,\u201d you whispered, \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing. I don\u2019t know how to be flirty or sexy or intimate. This is all new to me. Even just making out with you is new to me. I\u2019m just terrified of doing something stupid or wrong or just messing up, especially with someone like you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike me?\u201d he whispered, hesitantly taking another tiny step closer to you.</p> <p>\u201cSomeone with your reputation. Your\u2026 experience,\u201d you sighed, \u201cI can\u2019t match up to that.\u201d</p> <p>He let out a quiet laugh as he uncrossed his arms and delicately placed his hands on your hips, closing most of the distance that was left between the two of you. You looked up at him, hoping that the tears that threatened to break the surface didn\u2019t show, but the soft smile on his lips warmed your frozen nerves.</p> <p>\u201cFirst off, I don\u2019t want you to flirt with me. I want you to be yourself with me. Secondly, you are the sexiest woman I have ever laid eyes on,\u201d he smirked, \u201cand did I mention mention that you\u2019re gorgeous? And brilliant? And funny? I know I have a reputation, I know that. But the moment I met you, I wished that I could take all of that back, because I realized that all of my time had been wasted. None of them compared to you, babe. Not a damn one. I just want you, babe, in whatever ways you\u2019ll have me.\u201d</p> <p>As hard as you had fought against them, a few tears managed to escape and roll down your cheeks, but instead of insecurity, these were out of relief. You let out a laugh as you wiped them away, and then confidently wrapped your arms around his neck.</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d you sniffled.</p> <p>\u201cOkay?\u201d he grinned, resting his forehead against yours.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m wanna try,\u201d you smiled, \u201cI\u2019m not promising I won\u2019t get nervous, and I\u2019m not saying I don\u2019t want to take it slow, but I do want to try. And I want you\u2026 in a few different ways\u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally,\u201d he cooed, giving your hips a soft squeeze as he relished in how effortlessly you made him feel like the luckiest man alive, \u201cand what ways are those, exactly?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, for starters\u2026\u201d</p> <p>You mustered every ounce of confidence you could find in yourself, and then leaned up and kissed him. Slowly, but surely, and without pulling back. Your fingers toyed with the hair at the nape of his neck as he sunk into the kiss, moaning quietly against your lips.</p> <p>Just as your hands began to wander down to his chest and one of his hands traveled down to softly grab your ass, he let out a heavy exhale as he broke the kiss.</p> <p>\u201cSlow,\u201d he stated with a smirk, more as a reminder to himself than to you, \u201cHow about this. You get some sleep, and then you and I are going to spend the day together. We\u2019ll go do all of the cheesy, cliche couple-y things. I\u2019m going to give you the full boyfriend experience.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo is that what you are?\u201d You teased.</p> <p>\u201cWell I certainly hope so\u2026\u201d he said, feigning offense that you\u2019d think otherwise, earning a giggle out of you.</p> <p>\u201cSo, tomorrow?\u201d You confirmed.</p> <p>\u201cTomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>He placed a quick kiss to your lips and then one to the tip of your nose, and then turned and headed for the door. You followed him and held it open for him.</p> <p>\u201cWait,\u201d he said, turning on his heel just after he stepped into the hallway, \u201cyou said you kissed someone on a mission. Who?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUhhh, don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d you giggled, quickly shutting the door in his face and locking it. You leaned your back against the door for a second with an uncontrollable smile on your face and a new-found confidence in your new relationship.</p> <p>And just when you were about to walk away and head to bed, you could\u2019ve sworn you heard Tony grumble \u201cI swear to god, if it was Steve\u2026\u201d as he walked away, throwing you into a whole new state of panic.</p> <p><b>MASTERLIST</b></p> <p><b>TAGGED:</b> <br><br>@totheendofthelinepal <br>@locke-writes <br>@rogersxbarnesx <br>@bbbarneswrites <br>@harley-dent <br>@sebbytrash <br>@i-less-than-three-you <br>@aenna-4 <br>@litterally-trash <br>@belleetlabeast <br>@stormy-thomas <br>@becausefanfictionthough <br>@sebaestans <br>@fab-notfat <br>@shieldagentofthemonth <br>@spnfandommademeamoose <br>@hellomissmabel <br>@lovely-geek <br>@allinhishands <br>@majestic-squad <br>@happelu970 <br>@7minutes-tomidnight <br>@-supernatural-coffee-llama <br>@angel34jolly-blog <br>@feelmyroarrrr  <br>@dearthofequanimity <br>@lbouvet <br>@takemetothefictionalworld <br>@thesmolbear <br>@avengerofyourheart <br>@laurenwhitehouse-blog <br>@beccaanne814-blog <br>@melonberri <br>@lostinspace33 <br>@fangirl1029 <br>@ryverpenrad <br>@angryschnauzer <br>@lovelyladylilac <br>@bellenuit45 <br>@knittingknerdy <br>@the-real-tony-stank <br>@castielohcastiel <br>@ijustwanttobepartofyourworld <br>@eyeofdionysus <br>@buckyhawk <br>@oinchavengewho <br>@whatsbetterthanfantasy <br>@diving-down-to-wonderland <br>@ianbewiild <br>@pixierox101  <br>@marvel-ous-fics  <br>@devilstrip <br>@girl-next-door-writes <br>@nikkitia7 <br>@flowercrownsandmetallicarms <br>@jaybird6232 <br>@crownie-sr <br>@crazychick010 <br>@tinacuppy <br>@buckybarnesisalittleshit <br>@fantasticallyabnormal <br>@popsicle863 <br>@bwozzler <br>@bellastellaluna <br>@sebbeanstan <br>@divide-supermarketflowers <br>@secondstartotheright-imagines <br>@aesthetic-bbygoats  <br>@just-another-fangirl777 <br>@shieldagentofthemonth <br>@broken-pieces <br>@its-onepiece <br>@little-lord <br>@strawberrybucky <br>@lovelyfuckingcunt <br>@4theluvofall <br>@txcountrybelle <br>@ginasellsbooks  <br>@phasma-trash <br>@thevanishedillusion  <br>@magnitude101999 <br>@lady-thor-foster <br>@power-of-god-and-anime <br>@volcanicchoas <br>@a-watson-in-search-of-a-sherlock <br>@olivelongnprosper <br>@yourwonderbelle <br>@neeadinghugs <br>@odinhson <br>@dafnekeenfblog <br>@thinkwritexpress-official <br>@vethrvolnir <br>@wildefire <br>@heartssick <br>@riddikulus-obsessions <br>@cudan2 <br>@metalarmlover <br>@jaegers-and-kaijus <br>@pandamambo5<i> <br>@bookscoffeeandracoons <br>@katelynkargol <br>@stonedxsoldier\n\n</i> <br></p> <p><b>If you would like to be tagged or removed, or if I forgot anyone, please let me know &lt;3</b></p>",

But can you put aside your nervousness and inexperience to give a relationship with him a try?</i></p><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/39f61f1ce38fbf90f319c8ad8cf86e25/tumblr_inline_pgfx9tXq6R1uxurz7_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"450\" data-orig-height=\"300\">[[MORE]] <p>\u201c<i>Uh, I gotta go, um, check some emails.</i>\u201d</p> <p>You had joined Tony, who had just recently confessed his feelings for you, and some of the Avengers in the common room for a late night movie. You had initially taken a seat in one of the arm chairs, but before the film had started, Tony had pulled you over to the couch to sit beside him.</p> <p>He had grabbed one of the throw blankets and laid it across the two of you as he pulled you cozily into his side. He rested his arm on the back of the couch and lazily played with your hair, gently massaging your scalp with his finger tips.</p> <p>Peter sat on the floor in front of the couch on the other side of Tony\u2019s legs, eyes glued to the action film the entire time. Bucky, Steve, and Sam each took up a sofa sack towards the front of the room, while Wanda curled up in one of the arm chairs.</p> <p>The room was dark, lit only by the light of the flat screen TV, and the two of you had the couch to yourselves. Halfway through the film, Tony had grown completely bored of the movie and had turned all of his attention to you. He had moved his hand to your shoulder, his thumb softly rubbing the small bit of exposed skin of your collarbone, and placed soft, quiet kisses to your head.</p> <p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he whispered in your ear, so soft that only you could hear. He nudged you with his nose, encouraging him to look at you. With every touch of his fingertips and every soft kiss he had pressed on you, the butterflies in your stomach had fluttered, but when you finally turned your face towards him they burst into full flight.</p> <p>A sweet smirk teased the edges of his mouth as he bit his bottom lip, and his gaze danced between your eyes and your lips. In the weeks that had passed since he\u2019d admitted that he liked you, the two of you had only kissed briefly a few times, as you hardly had the time to be alone between jobs and missions.</p> <p>He leaned in and kissed you, softly at first to test the waters. But soon, he lost himself in it, and was instinctively pulling you closer to him while the kiss built in passion. You followed your own desires and sunk into the kiss, and within minutes you the two of you were making out with you halfway in his lap while the rest of the room was entirely oblivious to anything but the movie.</p> <p>All at once you became equally aware of how pleasantly your body was reacting to his touch and how you actually had no idea what you were doing, and the knowledge of the latter fact echoed in your head, causing every nervous fiber in your body to freeze. You immediately broke the kiss, and fell back into the couch and off of his lap.</p> <p>\u201cUh, I gotta go, um, check some emails,\u201d you murmured as you tossed the blanket off your lap and clumsily jumped up off the couch to rush to your room.</p> <p>You closed the door behind you and immediately threw yourself face first onto the bed, burying your face in your pillow. You let out a long, muffled groan and internally cursed yourself for panicking.</p> <p>All you wanted was to kiss Tony. Everytime you looked at him, all you wanted was him. Even before he had confessed his feelings for you, all you thought about was him, and you spent all your time imagining what it would be like for him to like you, to hold you, to kiss you, to\u2026</p> <p>You lifted your head up out of the pillow when there was a soft knock at your door.</p> <p>\u201c<i>Please don\u2019t be Tony, please don\u2019t be Tony, please don\u2019t be Tony,</i>\u201d you whispered to yourself as you approached the door.</p> <p>You\u2019d spent months wondering what would happen, what you would do if he ever showed up at your door, but now you had probably ruined any chance of it being anything good, and he was the last person you wanted to face.</p> <p>\u201cTony,\u201d you said awkwardly with a half-forced smile when you found him on the other side of your door.</p> <p>\u201cWhat did I do wrong?\u201d he asked immediately.</p> <p>\u201cWhat? Oh, nothing! I just- emails, you know?\u201d You stammered with a forced laugh, embarrassed that he was blaming himself for your trepidation.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t know, babe,\u201d he said, \u201cYou\u2019re notorious for staying on top of your work, so you wouldn\u2019t be behind on your emails, and who would be emailing you at midnight on a Saturday? I did something wrong. What did I do wrong?\u201d</p> <p><i>Babe</i>. He called you \u2018babe\u2019. He had called you \u2018beautiful\u2019 on occasion when he was flirting with you when you first joined the team, but by his reputation you knew you certainly weren\u2019t the first, and aside from that he had only ever called you by your name, which still sounded sweet enough on his lips. But \u2018babe\u2019\u2026 that made your heart skip a beat. </p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong, I promise,\u201d you sighed as you walked away from the door frame and leaned back against your desk. You stared at your feet and chewed on your lip, trying to find the words to explain how you felt.</p> <p>You heard the door click shut, and soon Tony stood in front of you with his arms crossed. He nudged your foot with his to get you to look up at him.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it, then? If you don\u2019t like me, I get it. I won\u2019t blame you,\u201d he said softly, \u201cJust tell me so I don\u2019t get my hopes up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d you nearly shouted, terrified that he\u2019d think you were anything less than head-over-heels for him, \u201cI like you! A lot!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen what is it?\u201d he pleaded, taking a step closer to you.</p> <p>\u201cThis is my first\u2026\u201d you sighed, struggling to find the right word, not knowing if relationship was exactly what it was yet, as you hadn\u2019t exactly become \u2018official\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cOh! Shit! I had no idea, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he said, his eyes wide with surprise and regret, \u201cthat wasn\u2019t at all what I was trying to do back there- I mean, that would\u2019ve been great if it turned into that- but that wasn\u2019t my intention! I just really wanted to kiss you. I really like kissing you. But I\u2019m sorry if you felt like you had to- we don\u2019t have to do that if you\u2019re not ready! We can wait, or not do it at all, or whatever you want! Really, I-\u201d</p> <p>\u201c<i>Tony</i>!\u201d you interrupted, the flush of your cheeks turning as red as his Iron Man suit, \u201cthat\u2019s not what I meant! I mean, that\u2019s part of it, but that\u2019s not specifically what I meant.\u201d</p> <p>He took a tiny step back, his brow knitting in confusion. \u201cYou\u2019re losing me here, babe. What do you mean?\u201d</p> <p>You took a deep breath and organized the words in your head before stating them, wanting to finally be as honest and as clear as possible.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been in a relationship.\u201d</p> <p>You saw his expression change and his eyes widen again as he took in the words you said and finally understood what you meant.</p> <p>\u201cOhhh,\u201d he said, \u201cwait, really?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut\u2026 how?\u201d he said, tilting his head as confusion washed over him again, \u201cYou\u2019re gorgeous, you\u2019re brilliant, you\u2019re funny\u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I just\u2026 never really had the time, and when I did have the time, if I even found someone I actually I liked, I didn\u2019t have the confidence to try.

I\u2019m just terrified of doing something stupid or wrong or just messing up, especially with someone like you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike me?\u201d he whispered, hesitantly taking another tiny step closer to you.</p> <p>\u201cSomeone with your reputation. Your\u2026 experience,\u201d you sighed, \u201cI can\u2019t match up to that.\u201d</p> <p>He let out a quiet laugh as he uncrossed his arms and delicately placed his hands on your hips, closing most of the distance that was left between the two of you. You looked up at him, hoping that the tears that threatened to break the surface didn\u2019t show, but the soft smile on his lips warmed your frozen nerves.</p> <p>\u201cFirst off, I don\u2019t want you to flirt with me. I want you to be yourself with me. Secondly, you are the sexiest woman I have ever laid eyes on,\u201d he smirked, \u201cand did I mention mention that you\u2019re gorgeous? And brilliant? And funny? I know I have a reputation, I know that. But the moment I met you, I wished that I could take all of that back, because I realized that all of my time had been wasted.

You let out a laugh as you wiped them away, and then confidently wrapped your arms around his neck.</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d you sniffled.</p> <p>\u201cOkay?\u201d he grinned, resting his forehead against yours.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m wanna try,\u201d you smiled, \u201cI\u2019m not promising I won\u2019t get nervous, and I\u2019m not saying I don\u2019t want to take it slow, but I do want to try. And I want you\u2026 in a few different ways\u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally,\u201d he cooed, giving your hips a soft squeeze as he relished in how effortlessly you made him feel like the luckiest man alive, \u201cand what ways are those, exactly?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, for starters\u2026\u201d</p> <p>You mustered every ounce of confidence you could find in yourself, and then leaned up and kissed him. Slowly, but surely, and without pulling back. Your fingers toyed with the hair at the nape of his neck as he sunk into the kiss, moaning quietly against your lips.</p> <p>Just as your hands began to wander down to his chest and one of his hands traveled down to softly grab your ass, he let out a heavy exhale as he broke the kiss.</p> <p>\u201cSlow,\u201d he stated with a smirk, more as a reminder to himself than to you, \u201cHow about this. You get some sleep, and then you and I are going to spend the day together. We\u2019ll go do all of the cheesy, cliche couple-y things. I\u2019m going to give you the full boyfriend experience.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo is that what you are?\u201d You teased.</p> <p>\u201cWell I certainly hope so\u2026\u201d he said, feigning offense that you\u2019d think otherwise, earning a giggle out of you.</p> <p>\u201cSo, tomorrow?\u201d You confirmed.</p> <p>\u201cTomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>He placed a quick kiss to your lips and then one to the tip of your nose, and then turned and headed for the door. You followed him and held it open for him.</p> <p>\u201cWait,\u201d he said, turning on his heel just after he stepped into the hallway, \u201cyou said you kissed someone on a mission. Who?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUhhh, don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d you giggled, quickly shutting the door in his face and locking it. You leaned your back against the door for a second with an uncontrollable smile on your face and a new-found confidence in your new relationship.</p> <p>And just when you were about to walk away and head to bed, you could\u2019ve sworn you heard Tony grumble \u201cI swear to god, if it was Steve\u2026\u201d as he walked away, throwing you into a whole new state of panic.</p> <p><b>MASTERLIST</b></p> <p><b>TAGGED:</b> <br><br>@totheendofthelinepal <br>@locke-writes <br>@rogersxbarnesx <br>@bbbarneswrites <br>@harley-dent <br>@sebbytrash <br>@i-less-than-three-you <br>@aenna-4 <br>@litterally-trash <br>@belleetlabeast <br>@stormy-thomas <br>@becausefanfictionthough <br>@sebaestans <br>@fab-notfat <br>@shieldagentofthemonth <br>@spnfandommademeamoose <br>@hellomissmabel <br>@lovely-geek <br>@allinhishands <br>@majestic-squad <br>@happelu970 <br>@7minutes-tomidnight <br>@-supernatural-coffee-llama <br>@angel34jolly-blog <br>@feelmyroarrrr  <br>@dearthofequanimity <br>@lbouvet <br>@takemetothefictionalworld <br>@thesmolbear <br>@avengerofyourheart <br>@laurenwhitehouse-blog <br>@beccaanne814-blog <br>@melonberri <br>@lostinspace33 <br>@fangirl1029 <br>@ryverpenrad <br>@angryschnauzer <br>@lovelyladylilac <br>@bellenuit45 <br>@knittingknerdy <br>@the-real-tony-stank <br>@castielohcastiel <br>@ijustwanttobepartofyourworld <br>@eyeofdionysus <br>@buckyhawk <br>@oinchavengewho <br>@whatsbetterthanfantasy <br>@diving-down-to-wonderland <br>@ianbewiild <br>@pixierox101  <br>@marvel-ous-fics  <br>@devilstrip <br>@girl-next-door-writes <br>@nikkitia7 <br>@flowercrownsandmetallicarms <br>@jaybird6232 <br>@crownie-sr <br>@crazychick010 <br>@tinacuppy <br>@buckybarnesisalittleshit <br>@fantasticallyabnormal <br>@popsicle863 <br>@bwozzler <br>@bellastellaluna <br>@sebbeanstan <br>@divide-supermarketflowers <br>@secondstartotheright-imagines <br>@aesthetic-bbygoats  <br>@just-another-fangirl777 <br>@shieldagentofthemonth <br>@broken-pieces <br>@its-onepiece <br>@little-lord <br>@strawberrybucky <br>@lovelyfuckingcunt <br>@4theluvofall <br>@txcountrybelle <br>@ginasellsbooks  <br>@phasma-trash <br>@thevanishedillusion  <br>@magnitude101999 <br>@lady-thor-foster <br>@power-of-god-and-anime <br>@volcanicchoas <br>@a-watson-in-search-of-a-sherlock <br>@olivelongnprosper <br>@yourwonderbelle <br>@neeadinghugs <br>@odinhson <br>@dafnekeenfblog <br>@thinkwritexpress-official <br>@vethrvolnir <br>@wildefire <br>@heartssick <br>@riddikulus-obsessions <br>@cudan2 <br>@metalarmlover <br>@jaegers-and-kaijus <br>@pandamambo5<i> <br>@bookscoffeeandracoons <br>@katelynkargol <br>@stonedxsoldier\n\n</i> <br></p> <p><b>If you would like to be tagged or removed, or if I forgot anyone, please let me know &lt;3</b></p>",

You had initially taken a seat in one of the arm chairs, but before the film had started, Tony had pulled you over to the couch to sit beside him.</p> <p>He had grabbed one of the throw blankets and laid it across the two of you as he pulled you cozily into his side. He rested his arm on the back of the couch and lazily played with your hair, gently massaging your scalp with his finger tips.</p> <p>Peter sat on the floor in front of the couch on the other side of Tony&rsquo;s legs, eyes glued to the action film the entire time. Bucky, Steve, and Sam each took up a sofa sack towards the front of the room, while Wanda curled up in one of the arm chairs.</p> <p>The room was dark, lit only by the light of the flat screen TV, and the two of you had the couch to yourselves. Halfway through the film, Tony had grown completely bored of the movie and had turned all of his attention to you. He had moved his hand to your shoulder, his thumb softly rubbing the small bit of exposed skin of your collarbone, and placed soft, quiet kisses to your head.</p> <p>&ldquo;Come here,&rdquo; he whispered in your ear, so soft that only you could hear. He nudged you with his nose, encouraging him to look at you. With every touch of his fingertips and every soft kiss he had pressed on you, the butterflies in your stomach had fluttered, but when you finally turned your face towards him they burst into full flight.</p> <p>A sweet smirk teased the edges of his mouth as he bit his bottom lip, and his gaze danced between your eyes and your lips. In the weeks that had passed since he&rsquo;d admitted that he liked you, the two of you had only kissed briefly a few times, as you hardly had the time to be alone between jobs and missions.</p> <p>He leaned in and kissed you, softly at first to test the waters. But soon, he lost himself in it, and was instinctively pulling you closer to him while the kiss built in passion. You followed your own desires and sunk into the kiss, and within minutes you the two of you were making out with you halfway in his lap while the rest of the room was entirely oblivious to anything but the movie.</p> <p>All at once you became equally aware of how pleasantly your body was reacting to his touch and how you actually had no idea what you were doing, and the knowledge of the latter fact echoed in your head, causing every nervous fiber in your body to freeze. You immediately broke the kiss, and fell back into the couch and off of his lap.</p> <p>&ldquo;Uh, I gotta go, um, check some emails,&rdquo; you murmured as you tossed the blanket off your lap and clumsily jumped up off the couch to rush to your room.</p> <p>You closed the door behind you and immediately threw yourself face first onto the bed, burying your face in your pillow. You let out a long, muffled groan and internally cursed yourself for panicking.</p> <p>All you wanted was to kiss Tony. Everytime you looked at him, all you wanted was him. Even before he had confessed his feelings for you, all you thought about was him, and you spent all your time imagining what it would be like for him to like you, to hold you, to kiss you, to&hellip;</p> <p>You lifted your head up out of the pillow when there was a soft knock at your door.</p> <p>&ldquo;<i>Please don&rsquo;t be Tony, please don&rsquo;t be Tony, please don&rsquo;t be Tony,</i>&rdquo; you whispered to yourself as you approached the door.</p> <p>You&rsquo;d spent months wondering what would happen, what you would do if he ever showed up at your door, but now you had probably ruined any chance of it being anything good, and he was the last person you wanted to face.</p> <p>&ldquo;Tony,&rdquo; you said awkwardly with a half-forced smile when you found him on the other side of your door.</p> <p>&ldquo;What did I do wrong?&rdquo; he asked immediately.</p> <p>&ldquo;What? Oh, nothing! I just- emails, you know?&rdquo; You stammered with a forced laugh, embarrassed that he was blaming himself for your trepidation.</p> <p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t know, babe,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re notorious for staying on top of your work, so you wouldn&rsquo;t be behind on your emails, and who would be emailing you at midnight on a Saturday? I did something wrong. What did I do wrong?&rdquo;</p> <p><i>Babe</i>. He called you &lsquo;babe&rsquo;. He had called you &lsquo;beautiful&rsquo; on occasion when he was flirting with you when you first joined the team, but by his reputation you knew you certainly weren&rsquo;t the first, and aside from that he had only ever called you by your name, which still sounded sweet enough on his lips. But &lsquo;babe&rsquo;&hellip; that made your heart skip a beat. </p> <p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong, I promise,&rdquo; you sighed as you walked away from the door frame and leaned back against your desk. You stared at your feet and chewed on your lip, trying to find the words to explain how you felt.</p> <p>You heard the door click shut, and soon Tony stood in front of you with his arms crossed. He nudged your foot with his to get you to look up at him.</p> <p>&ldquo;What is it, then? If you don&rsquo;t like me, I get it. I won&rsquo;t blame you,&rdquo; he said softly, &ldquo;Just tell me so I don&rsquo;t get my hopes up.&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; you nearly shouted, terrified that he&rsquo;d think you were anything less than head-over-heels for him, &ldquo;I like you! A lot!&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;Then what is it?&rdquo; he pleaded, taking a step closer to you.</p> <p>&ldquo;This is my first&hellip;&rdquo; you sighed, struggling to find the right word, not knowing if relationship was exactly what it was yet, as you hadn&rsquo;t exactly become &lsquo;official&rsquo;.</p> <p>&ldquo;Oh! Shit! I had no idea, I&rsquo;m so sorry,&rdquo; he said, his eyes wide with surprise and regret, &ldquo;that wasn&rsquo;t at all what I was trying to do back there- I mean, that would&rsquo;ve been great if it turned into that- but that wasn&rsquo;t my intention! I just really wanted to kiss you. I really like kissing you. But I&rsquo;m sorry if you felt like you had to- we don&rsquo;t have to do that if you&rsquo;re not ready! We can wait, or not do it at all, or whatever you want! Really, I-&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;<i>Tony</i>!&rdquo; you interrupted, the flush of your cheeks turning as red as his Iron Man suit, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s not what I meant! I mean, that&rsquo;s part of it, but that&rsquo;s not specifically what I meant.&rdquo;</p> <p>He took a tiny step back, his brow knitting in confusion. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re losing me here, babe. What do you mean?&rdquo;</p> <p>You took a deep breath and organized the words in your head before stating them, wanting to finally be as honest and as clear as possible.</p> <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been in a relationship.&rdquo;</p> <p>You saw his expression change and his eyes widen again as he took in the words you said and finally understood what you meant.</p> <p>&ldquo;Ohhh,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;wait, really?&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;But&hellip; how?&rdquo; he said, tilting his head as confusion washed over him again, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re gorgeous, you&rsquo;re brilliant, you&rsquo;re funny&hellip;&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I just&hellip; never really had the time, and when I did have the time, if I even found someone I actually I liked, I didn&rsquo;t have the confidence to try. I&rsquo;ve kissed like, three guys, but they weren&rsquo;t real kisses. One was during the only round of spin the bottle I ever played in high school, one was when I was drunk on my 21st birthday, and one was to get out of a dodgy situation on a mission.&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;But you do like me?&rdquo; he asked curiously.</p> <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; you insisted, &ldquo;a lot.&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;So, if you like me, and you know I like you too- so much, by the way, so so much- then what&rsquo;s the issue here?&rdquo;</p> <p>You dropped your gaze to your feet again, afraid of being so vulnerable with someone for the first time, especially with someone whos reputation makes your insecurities that much harder to ignore.</p> <p>&ldquo;I&hellip; I just get nervous,&rdquo; you whispered, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m doing. I don&rsquo;t know how to be flirty or sexy or intimate. This is all new to me. Even just making out with you is new to me. I&rsquo;m just terrified of doing something stupid or wrong or just messing up, especially with someone like you.&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;Like me?&rdquo; he whispered, hesitantly taking another tiny step closer to you.</p> <p>&ldquo;Someone with your reputation. Your&hellip; experience,&rdquo; you sighed, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t match up to that.&rdquo;</p> <p>He let out a quiet laugh as he uncrossed his arms and delicately placed his hands on your hips, closing most of the distance that was left between the two of you. You looked up at him, hoping that the tears that threatened to break the surface didn&rsquo;t show, but the soft smile on his lips warmed your frozen nerves.</p> <p>&ldquo;First off, I don&rsquo;t want you to flirt with me. I want you to be yourself with me. Secondly, you are the sexiest woman I have ever laid eyes on,&rdquo; he smirked, &ldquo;and did I mention mention that you&rsquo;re gorgeous? And brilliant? And funny? I know I have a reputation, I know that. But the moment I met you, I wished that I could take all of that back, because I realized that all of my time had been wasted. None of them compared to you, babe. Not a damn one. I just want you, babe, in whatever ways you&rsquo;ll have me.&rdquo;</p> <p>As hard as you had fought against them, a few tears managed to escape and roll down your cheeks, but instead of insecurity, these were out of relief. You let out a laugh as you wiped them away, and then confidently wrapped your arms around his neck.</p> <p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; you sniffled.</p> <p>&ldquo;Okay?&rdquo; he grinned, resting his forehead against yours.</p> <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m wanna try,&rdquo; you smiled, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not promising I won&rsquo;t get nervous, and I&rsquo;m not saying I don&rsquo;t want to take it slow, but I do want to try. And I want you&hellip; in a few different ways&hellip;&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;Really,&rdquo; he cooed, giving your hips a soft squeeze as he relished in how effortlessly you made him feel like the luckiest man alive, &ldquo;and what ways are those, exactly?&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;Well, for starters&hellip;&rdquo;</p> <p>You mustered every ounce of confidence you could find in yourself, and then leaned up and kissed him.
