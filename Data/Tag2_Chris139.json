        "body": "<p><b>About: </b>I\u2019ve been having a lot of feelings about endgame lately and I figured the actors would be, too. So here\u2019s a short and sweet little first person pov something about Chris returning home from wrapping filming.</p><p><b>Word Count: </b>1,524</p><!-- more --><p><b></b></p><p>\tI sat on the sofa trying to read a book instead of watching the clock tick, waiting for him to come home. It was getting late and I knew it was going to be a long day filming for Chris so I waited for him anxiously, knowing he\u2019d need some comfort. All day I\u2019d been trying to distract myself. I even cleaned the stove\u2019s burners- do you know how desperate I have to be to scrub the stove top? Now I found myself staring at a page without reading the words as my eyes kept flicking to the digital clock on the television box, not even allowing a minute to pass before I checked again.</p><p>\tIt had been 9:32 the last three times I looked when I heard the front door slowly creek open and the sound of Chris\u2019 heavy footsteps echoing down the hall. My heart leapt into my throat as I dropped the book I barely even read, but I didn\u2019t rush to him, concerned he would be overwhelmed by the million questions I\u2019d been waiting to ask all day. Chris dropped his duffle bag, stuffed with the things he\u2019d cleared out of his trailer, and leaned against the doorway. I\u2019d grown so used to Chris without his costume it still surprised me to see his hair bleached to the classic Steve Rogers blonde. I started to speak, but the fatigue almost seeping from him stopped me. I bit my lip, hoping for some kind of sign as to how I could be there for him.</p><p>\tChris dropped his head, allowing a sigh he seemed to be holding in for years finally escape his lips. \u201cIt\u2019s really over, huh?\u201d Chris lifted his head and, in the reflection of the dim light glinting in his eyes, I could see they were glassy. He was giving me that smirk, even though it was rather sad, and I knew he was trying to tell me he was okay. I jumped up from the couch, tossing my blanket and book haphazardly to the side as I all but ran to him. I wrapped my arms around Chris\u2019s waist and pressed my cheek to his chest. He stood there stunned for a minute before enveloping me in his arms, his chest rumbling with a chuckle. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting all day for this,\u201d I sighed, finding comfort in the thump of his heart. \u201cI never would have guessed,\u201d Chris teased before he placed a kiss on the top of my head, reminding me that this was supposed to be the other way around. I was supposed to make him a warm cup of coffee, kiss his cheek, and tell him it was all going to be okay.</p><p>\tI pulled away from his hug and grabbed his face in my hands, searching for any hint of any kind of emotion, but he was just grinning. \u201cHow was it?\u201d I asked. If it was me, and I had just wrapped filming for the last time on a project I had been involved with for nearly a decade, I\u2019d be an inconsolable mess. But here he was, smiling from ear to ear even with fresh tears in his eyes. \u201cAbsolutely emotionally exhausting and incredibly depressing actually,\u201d he said without his grin even wavering. I furrowed my eyebrows at him, probably looking pretty flabbergasted, and he just laughed and asked me what I was so confused by. \u201cBecause you had a terrible, emotionally straining day and you\u2019re smiling like an idiot,\u201d I scoffed like it was obvious. I realized I was still caressing his cheeks and dropped my hands.</p><p>Chris rolled his eyes and held them in his own. \u201cBecause it was great while it lasted, but it\u2019s over now,\u201d Chris sighed and then took a deep breath. \u201cAnd,\u201d he continued, tilting my head up to him with his forefinger under my chin, \u201cno matter what role I play, I get to come home to you.\u201d Chris\u2019s grin melted into a smirk as he watched my cheeks erupt into flames. It was my turn to roll my eyes because, of course, he couldn\u2019t resist being sweet enough to cause cavities.</p><p>I wrenched myself from his grip and sat back on the couch, curling my feet up and holding the blanket up. Chris took the hint and occupied the other half, pulling the covers over the two of us. I stuck my feet under his thigh, assuming our usual tv-binging position and really just enjoying each other\u2019s company.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind if we watch the first Avengers?\u201d Chris asked almost hesitantly. He scratched the back of his head, looking at me hopefully. I nodded, flicking to Netflix and waiting for it to load. \u201cIn a nostalgic mood?\u201d I asked. I wondered if it was something deeper. Chris hummed as if that was a response, so I stretched my toes under his leg to grab his attention. \u201cWhat was that for?\u201d Chris nearly yelped as he stared at me with wide eyes and eyebrows that were about to take off through the ceiling. I repeated my question, albeit through giggles.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah\u2026\u201d Chris trailed off. I typed the movie\u2019s name into the search bar and selected it. \u201cIt\u2019s okay if you are,\u201d I tried to reassure him. \u201cIt was a big part of your life with some of your best friends, it\u2019s alright to miss it. Like high school,\u201d I tried to joke. \u201cIt\u2019s cool sneaking a couple drinks around your parents, not having to worry about bills, and seeing your friends in class every day.\u201d Chris clutched his chest as he laughed, but the gesture was almost half-hearted. \u201cBut if that hadn\u2019t ended, you wouldn\u2019t be here. If this part of your life didn\u2019t end, you wouldn\u2019t get to where you\u2019re supposed to be.\u201d I was talking over the title sequence now, but neither of us was really watching.</p><p>Chris rubbed his chin, trying to scratch his nonexistent beard out of habit. \u201cGuess you\u2019re right,\u201d he said, resting his elbow on my knee. I watched as he pushed his hair back, just admiring him. We didn\u2019t say anything else for a while and I tried to just watch the film without worrying what Chris was going through, but that proved to be as good as impossible. Once I looked over, I saw a wistful smile on his face like he was watching a VHS tape of his first steps or his favorite Christmas. He broke out laughing, so genuinely happy it lifted the weight from my shoulders. We were at the part where Bruce became the Hulk and I wasn\u2019t sure what was so funny until Chris started sharing all of these behind the scenes stories even I hadn\u2019t heard before.</p><p>\u201cAnd the wires malfunctioned or something so Hemsworth just went flying,\u201d Chris finished, almost in tears. \u201cI completely forgot half of that happened,\u201d he sighed, still trying to catch his breath from all the laughter. I was smiling so hard my cheeks hurt.</p><p>By the end of the Avengers marathon, that took even longer with Chris pausing every few scenes to tell another story which I didn\u2019t mind too much, I think we both fell asleep on the couch. When I woke up, I was laying on top of Chris, with his hand tucked into the waistband of my joggers and his other arm wrapped around me. I untangled myself from him and tried to walk as quietly as I could to the kitchen.</p><p>We\u2019d been staying in this apartment we were renting while Chris was filming in Georgia. I began making breakfast for the two of us, even though I barely knew my way around this kitchen. I opened the cabinet where Chris had naturally put the pans on the highest shelf. Even on my tip toes, I could barely reach the pans, nudging them closer to the edge until they came clattering down to the floor in a loud crash that would\u2019ve woken the neighbors, let alone Chris.</p><p>He came stumbling into the kitchen. Still groggy from sleep, he asked, \u201cyou okay?\u201d I nodded as I picked the pans up from the floor. He bent down to help, slower than a sloth. \u201cYou scared me so badly,\u201d he remarked with a voice that was still like sandpaper. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I dropped a pan. What\u2019s the worst you could do?\u201d I joked. Chris rubbed his eyes, processing my question. \u201cDivorce you,\u201d he concluded as he passed me everything he picked up. I started washing the pan I planned on using. I rolled my eyes as Chris wrapped his arms around my waist, resting his head on top of mine. \u201cYou\u2019d have to marry me first,\u201d I told him, trying to bottle up my impatience. I\u2019ve been waiting for that to happen for a while now, which Chris finally started picking up on. \u201cJust wait,\u201d Chris said softly, showering the top of my head with light kisses. \u201cJust wait.\u201d</p>",

It was getting late and I knew it was going to be a long day filming for Chris so I waited for him anxiously, knowing he\u2019d need some comfort. All day I\u2019d been trying to distract myself. I even cleaned the stove\u2019s burners- do you know how desperate I have to be to scrub the stove top? Now I found myself staring at a page without reading the words as my eyes kept flicking to the digital clock on the television box, not even allowing a minute to pass before I checked again.</p><p>\tIt had been 9:32 the last three times I looked when I heard the front door slowly creek open and the sound of Chris\u2019 heavy footsteps echoing down the hall. My heart leapt into my throat as I dropped the book I barely even read, but I didn\u2019t rush to him, concerned he would be overwhelmed by the million questions I\u2019d been waiting to ask all day. Chris dropped his duffle bag, stuffed with the things he\u2019d cleared out of his trailer, and leaned against the doorway. I\u2019d grown so used to Chris without his costume it still surprised me to see his hair bleached to the classic Steve Rogers blonde. I started to speak, but the fatigue almost seeping from him stopped me. I bit my lip, hoping for some kind of sign as to how I could be there for him.</p><p>\tChris dropped his head, allowing a sigh he seemed to be holding in for years finally escape his lips. \u201cIt\u2019s really over, huh?\u201d Chris lifted his head and, in the reflection of the dim light glinting in his eyes, I could see they were glassy. He was giving me that smirk, even though it was rather sad, and I knew he was trying to tell me he was okay. I jumped up from the couch, tossing my blanket and book haphazardly to the side as I all but ran to him. I wrapped my arms around Chris\u2019s waist and pressed my cheek to his chest. He stood there stunned for a minute before enveloping me in his arms, his chest rumbling with a chuckle. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting all day for this,\u201d I sighed, finding comfort in the thump of his heart. \u201cI never would have guessed,\u201d Chris teased before he placed a kiss on the top of my head, reminding me that this was supposed to be the other way around. I was supposed to make him a warm cup of coffee, kiss his cheek, and tell him it was all going to be okay.</p><p>\tI pulled away from his hug and grabbed his face in my hands, searching for any hint of any kind of emotion, but he was just grinning. \u201cHow was it?\u201d I asked. If it was me, and I had just wrapped filming for the last time on a project I had been involved with for nearly a decade, I\u2019d be an inconsolable mess. But here he was, smiling from ear to ear even with fresh tears in his eyes. \u201cAbsolutely emotionally exhausting and incredibly depressing actually,\u201d he said without his grin even wavering. I furrowed my eyebrows at him, probably looking pretty flabbergasted, and he just laughed and asked me what I was so confused by. \u201cBecause you had a terrible, emotionally straining day and you\u2019re smiling like an idiot,\u201d I scoffed like it was obvious. I realized I was still caressing his cheeks and dropped my hands.</p><p>Chris rolled his eyes and held them in his own. \u201cBecause it was great while it lasted, but it\u2019s over now,\u201d Chris sighed and then took a deep breath. \u201cAnd,\u201d he continued, tilting my head up to him with his forefinger under my chin, \u201cno matter what role I play, I get to come home to you.\u201d Chris\u2019s grin melted into a smirk as he watched my cheeks erupt into flames. It was my turn to roll my eyes because, of course, he couldn\u2019t resist being sweet enough to cause cavities.</p><p>I wrenched myself from his grip and sat back on the couch, curling my feet up and holding the blanket up. Chris took the hint and occupied the other half, pulling the covers over the two of us. I stuck my feet under his thigh, assuming our usual tv-binging position and really just enjoying each other\u2019s company.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind if we watch the first Avengers?\u201d Chris asked almost hesitantly. He scratched the back of his head, looking at me hopefully. I nodded, flicking to Netflix and waiting for it to load. \u201cIn a nostalgic mood?\u201d I asked. I wondered if it was something deeper. Chris hummed as if that was a response, so I stretched my toes under his leg to grab his attention. \u201cWhat was that for?\u201d Chris nearly yelped as he stared at me with wide eyes and eyebrows that were about to take off through the ceiling. I repeated my question, albeit through giggles.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah\u2026\u201d Chris trailed off. I typed the movie\u2019s name into the search bar and selected it. \u201cIt\u2019s okay if you are,\u201d I tried to reassure him. \u201cIt was a big part of your life with some of your best friends, it\u2019s alright to miss it. Like high school,\u201d I tried to joke. \u201cIt\u2019s cool sneaking a couple drinks around your parents, not having to worry about bills, and seeing your friends in class every day.\u201d Chris clutched his chest as he laughed, but the gesture was almost half-hearted. \u201cBut if that hadn\u2019t ended, you wouldn\u2019t be here. If this part of your life didn\u2019t end, you wouldn\u2019t get to where you\u2019re supposed to be.\u201d I was talking over the title sequence now, but neither of us was really watching.</p><p>Chris rubbed his chin, trying to scratch his nonexistent beard out of habit. \u201cGuess you\u2019re right,\u201d he said, resting his elbow on my knee. I watched as he pushed his hair back, just admiring him. We didn\u2019t say anything else for a while and I tried to just watch the film without worrying what Chris was going through, but that proved to be as good as impossible. Once I looked over, I saw a wistful smile on his face like he was watching a VHS tape of his first steps or his favorite Christmas. He broke out laughing, so genuinely happy it lifted the weight from my shoulders. We were at the part where Bruce became the Hulk and I wasn\u2019t sure what was so funny until Chris started sharing all of these behind the scenes stories even I hadn\u2019t heard before.</p><p>\u201cAnd the wires malfunctioned or something so Hemsworth just went flying,\u201d Chris finished, almost in tears. \u201cI completely forgot half of that happened,\u201d he sighed, still trying to catch his breath from all the laughter. I was smiling so hard my cheeks hurt.</p><p>By the end of the Avengers marathon, that took even longer with Chris pausing every few scenes to tell another story which I didn\u2019t mind too much, I think we both fell asleep on the couch. When I woke up, I was laying on top of Chris, with his hand tucked into the waistband of my joggers and his other arm wrapped around me. I untangled myself from him and tried to walk as quietly as I could to the kitchen.</p><p>We\u2019d been staying in this apartment we were renting while Chris was filming in Georgia. I began making breakfast for the two of us, even though I barely knew my way around this kitchen. I opened the cabinet where Chris had naturally put the pans on the highest shelf. Even on my tip toes, I could barely reach the pans, nudging them closer to the edge until they came clattering down to the floor in a loud crash that would\u2019ve woken the neighbors, let alone Chris.</p><p>He came stumbling into the kitchen. Still groggy from sleep, he asked, \u201cyou okay?\u201d I nodded as I picked the pans up from the floor. He bent down to help, slower than a sloth. \u201cYou scared me so badly,\u201d he remarked with a voice that was still like sandpaper. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I dropped a pan. What\u2019s the worst you could do?\u201d I joked. Chris rubbed his eyes, processing my question. \u201cDivorce you,\u201d he concluded as he passed me everything he picked up. I started washing the pan I planned on using. I rolled my eyes as Chris wrapped his arms around my waist, resting his head on top of mine. \u201cYou\u2019d have to marry me first,\u201d I told him, trying to bottle up my impatience. I\u2019ve been waiting for that to happen for a while now, which Chris finally started picking up on. \u201cJust wait,\u201d Chris said softly, showering the top of my head with light kisses. \u201cJust wait.\u201d</p>",

I began making breakfast for the two of us, even though I barely knew my way around this kitchen. I opened the cabinet where Chris had naturally put the pans on the highest shelf. Even on my tip toes, I could barely reach the pans, nudging them closer to the edge until they came clattering down to the floor in a loud crash that would&rsquo;ve woken the neighbors, let alone Chris.</p><p>He came stumbling into the kitchen. Still groggy from sleep, he asked, &ldquo;you okay?&rdquo; I nodded as I picked the pans up from the floor. He bent down to help, slower than a sloth. &ldquo;You scared me so badly,&rdquo; he remarked with a voice that was still like sandpaper. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I dropped a pan. What&rsquo;s the worst you could do?&rdquo; I joked. Chris rubbed his eyes, processing my question. &ldquo;Divorce you,&rdquo; he concluded as he passed me everything he picked up. I started washing the pan I planned on using. I rolled my eyes as Chris wrapped his arms around my waist, resting his head on top of mine. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d have to marry me first,&rdquo; I told him, trying to bottle up my impatience. I&rsquo;ve been waiting for that to happen for a while now, which Chris finally started picking up on. &ldquo;Just wait,&rdquo; Chris said softly, showering the top of my head with light kisses. &ldquo;Just wait.&rdquo;</p>",
