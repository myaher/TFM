You said you were in love with her, mate?\u201d Liam asked.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI am. She\u2019s an amazing person, Liam. She\u2019s sweet, she\u2019s funny, she\u2019s <i>really</i> fucking kind,\u201d he listed. \u201cThe list goes on.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019d you even meet her?\u201d Louis asked.</p>\n\n<p>Harry smiled. \u201cWe met at a coffee shop actually. You know how I just moved right?\u201d </p>\n\n<p>They all nodded.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWell, I\u2019d seen her there a few times, studying away or having coffee with her friends\u2014sometimes alone while watching videos on her phone. She would always laugh at them and I never knew what she was watching until she told me\u2014they were funny cat videos,\u201d Harry laughed to himself. The two often sit and watch them together\u2014it\u2019s kind of their thing. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cAnd so I started going there more often, to see her. And I noticed she ordered caramel coffee\u2019s every time\u2014after noon. Before noon she would get caramel macchiatos. And so I ordered the same thing as he once\u2014it was after noon, like one, so I ordered a caramel iced coffee, and when they called hers I went for it and said I ordered the same thing. Then I asked her if she was busy, so I could sit with her. And well, the rest if history.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>\u201cAw, daddy, you remember,\u201d he heard, then smiled.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cCourse I do, bubs,\u201d he looked over his shoulder and reached for her. She walked towards him with a smile, putting her hand in his and when she was close enough he kissed the back of her hand and pulled her closer. She sat beside him and he kissed her cheek. \u201c m\u2019 sweet little girl, aren\u2019t you, bubby?\u201d</p>",

Where\u2019s the bathroom?\u201d </p>\n\n<p>\u201cRight down the hall\u2014here, I\u2019ll take you, baby.

Of course she\u2019d call him daddy. Why wouldn\u2019t she call him daddy? He\u2019s her daddy, after all. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cShe keeps calling you daddy? It was cute the first time but now it\u2019s getting a bit weird,\u201d Liam mumbled.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOhhhh, no\u2014she\u2019s like\u2014that\u2019s our relationship,\u201d he explained, laughing a little. \u201cShe calls me that all the time.

You said you were in love with her, mate?\u201d Liam asked.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI am. She\u2019s an amazing person, Liam. She\u2019s sweet, she\u2019s funny, she\u2019s <i>really</i> fucking kind,\u201d he listed. \u201cThe list goes on.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019d you even meet her?\u201d Louis asked.</p>\n\n<p>Harry smiled. \u201cWe met at a coffee shop actually. You know how I just moved right?\u201d </p>\n\n<p>They all nodded.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWell, I\u2019d seen her there a few times, studying away or having coffee with her friends\u2014sometimes alone while watching videos on her phone. She would always laugh at them and I never knew what she was watching until she told me\u2014they were funny cat videos,\u201d Harry laughed to himself. The two often sit and watch them together\u2014it\u2019s kind of their thing. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cAnd so I started going there more often, to see her. And I noticed she ordered caramel coffee\u2019s every time\u2014after noon. Before noon she would get caramel macchiatos. And so I ordered the same thing as he once\u2014it was after noon, like one, so I ordered a caramel iced coffee, and when they called hers I went for it and said I ordered the same thing. Then I asked her if she was busy, so I could sit with her.

He smiled and kissed her bump, then her forehead before he reached for his phone to turn off the extra alarm he has set in case he misses the first one.</p>\n\n<p>Only he found several notifications. Notifications telling him that his wife was pregnant. Notifications  from various news networks and magazines.</p>\n\n<p>This confused Harry because so far, the only people who knew she was pregnant was her immediate family and his. And they were both told to keep it a secret.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe paparazzi got a picture of her while she was out? Harry clicked one of the man notifications to check out the proof they had on their very true claim.</p>\n\n<p>It was the picture from dinner last night.</p>\n\n<p>And the screenshot was an Instagram post.

You took a crumpet out of the freezer and tried to make one of those fruit shakes yourself- strawberries, blueberries and banana would have to do the trick. You were pretty sure lately he had been adding almonds- or was it cashew nuts?- but you didn\u2019t risk it. Maybe you could text him? But then again he hadn\u2019t come back home last night.\u00a0</p><p>Jeff had made a bed for him at the attic- he had just covered the couch with sheets- but he didn\u2019t care for he hadn\u2019t really slept at all. He didn\u2019t think it was possible not to sleep one single minute when one was lying on a bed all night but it turned out once again he was wrong and then he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about all the times he had been wrong in his life. He had been wrong when he was seven and he had stolen that one tale about that bunny who wasn\u2019t good at Maths from the school library and he had been wrong when he was thirteen and he had made fun of Gemma after her performance at the school graduation party. He had been wrong every single time he had lied to his mum and he had been wrong when he didn\u2019t make it on time on one of your dates. He was wrong when he forgot to do the dishes, he had been wrong when he didn\u2019t call you that one time before his concert in Melbourne even though he said he would. He had been wrong when he dismissed your insecurities about Ursula and instead of making you feel like you had nothing to fear, he simply ignored your jealousy and thought you were just beeing needy. He was wrong when he didn\u2019t try to change your mind last night.\u00a0</p><p>You had made way too much smoothie- enough for two people- so you threw the rest down the sink because you remember Harry saying <i>you have to drink it as soon as it\u2019s made, baby, because otherwise the fruit falls to the bottom and it looks disgusting. </i>You found yourself staring at Harry\u2019s mug. It was so Harry- not necessarily the mug but the fact that he would use that old mug you had got him on your trip to Scotland two weeks after you started dating, instead of any other fancy, way better mug from that home deco shop he liked so much. But that was the thing about Harry- he could have anything in the world and still he would never change that <i>special pillow for bad backs </i>your mum had gotten him for Christmas for any other fancy pillow in the world, just because that pillow had been given to him by <i>your mum, </i>just like the mug had been given to him by<i> you.</i>\u00a0Looking down at your belly, you wondered if that part of him would also rather have you all fat and swollen over any other model he could easily snap a finger and have.\u00a0</p><p><i>Sunday\u00a0</i></p><p>He had gone out for lunch with James and Julia after his friend\u2019s many complaints about <i>how long it had been since last time they had seen each other. </i>Julia suggested he could write a letter to you and maybe never send it, but just write down all the reasons why you\u00a0<i>should want </i>to raise a child with him. He ordered a quesadilla, instead of the salad with chicken and raisins he usually had, just because he thought you would have made fun of him for going to a Mexican place and order a salad he could easily make at home.\u00a0</p><p>If you were having a baby you were sure he must be really sad in there because you hadn\u2019t stopped crying all day long. You had woken up with a headache and you had looked to your left, ready to tell Harry so he could make it better, only to find the blank spot and all those pictures of the two of you you had stuck to the wall last time he had been gone for tour. He used to call it <i>the memorial wall </i>and he used to stick candid polaroids of you every time he was home. You wondered how <i>the memorial wall </i>would look like with a scan of the baby on it and then with polaroids of a little one with a chin dirty on mashed veggies. Your lips curled up in a smirk when you thought about how healthy Harry\u2019s pur\u00e9es would be for the little one. Y<i>ou have to eat it as soon as it\u2019s made, baby, because otherwise the leek\u00a0 falls to the bottom and it looks disgusting.</i></p><p><i>Monday</i></p><p><i>14. I am very good at board games, so they would love rainy days with dad.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>15. I make a killer pumpkin soup.</i></p><p><i>16. I used to be baker, so no problem with birthday cakes, birthday cupcakes for school&hellip; I know I haven\u2019t baked in a while but you know what they say- once a baker, always a baker.\u00a0</i></p><p>Gemma had been texting you pictures of bouquets all morning. You wondered if she was texting Harry too. <i>Show them to my brother please. </i>You frowned at that. He hadn\u2019t told her and he had done the right thing- this was her wedding, she didn\u2019t have time to worry about your fight over a baby bump. And talking about the bump, you\u2019d have to send your dress to a tailor. You texted Harry the bouquet pictures. <i>I think roses are prettier than peonies.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Tuesday</i></p><p>Gemma had just left Jeff\u2019s apartment. She had called Harry at least 35 times but he had not picked up once. <i>She probably knows and who wants to talk about it? </i>So she had called you and then she had called Jeff and then she had come and had scolded and hit Harry as he covered his junk with a pillow. <i>And you know what? She\u2019s right, roses are prettier than fucking peonies. </i>He sighed, lying on the couch and hoping to God Gem would say you had said yes.\u00a0</p><p>You opened the door on your tracksuit. Gemma didn\u2019t even ask as she made her way inside your apartment.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWould you like some tea?\u201d You whispered.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She snapped.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t have time for tea. Y/N, I know my brother is an idiot. Lord knows I\u2019ve spent my entire life telling him just that but I\u2019m about to get married and here\u2019s what I hope- that my future husband loves me half as much as my brother loves you. That would be enough.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGreen or white tea?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d She yelled.\u00a0</p><p>You turned around, frowning for Gemma had never, ever, raised her voice at you or even argue with you for the smallest of things.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cListen to me!\u201d She yelled again.\u00a0\u201cOur cook\u2019s wife called saying he\u2019s depressed, Mike\u2019s dad\u2019s cat passed away last night and my wedding dress doesn\u2019t fit because my fucking bum got bigger even thought I\u2019ve been eating celery for a week, so I\u2019m hungry, I\u2019m mad and I\u2019m worried and tomorrow we\u2019re having a nice dinner party so Mike and I can fucking relax and you both are going to be there, do you hear me? You both! And you would be happy and smiley and you would not let my mother know any of this or I would have both your fucking brainless heads on a tray for my wedding day!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You nodded, your lips parted and your brows furrowed over your nose as she took deep breaths and gathered her blond hair on a ponytail.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd I will have a lime blossom tea, please.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You nodded and a second later you placed the tea in front of her, making another one for yourself before you sat down next to her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou should probably have chicken too, otherwise you\u2019d retain fluids and get more swollen. I mean, in between the celery meals.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>She bursted out laughing.\u00a0</p><p>Wednesday night</p><p>You weren\u2019t sure who was going to get there first but you just hoped for your sake Gemma had placed name tags on your seats so you didn\u2019t have to go through the disappointment of seeing Harry sitting next to someone else.\u00a0</p><p>He was standing, not far from the table, when he saw you walking in. It must be true- what they said that women only became prettier when they were pregnant- because you looked like you just came out of a dream. You smiled timidly at those who greeted you and from his spot next to his cousins he could see you were sad and shy and somewhat still scared. He hated to see you like that- he wanted to change everything in the world so you would never be afraid again- but he also remembered it had been his job to make you feel safe and fearless- at least when it came about family- and he had failed you so he was very surprised when you made your way towards him without hesitation the moment your eyes met his.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d You smiled timidly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d He smiled, relief washing over his very soul as soon as he heard your voice.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs your mum here already?\u201d\u00a0</p><p><i>So that was the reason you had come to him- so she wouldn\u2019t know.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He nodded.\u00a0</p><p>Before he could say anything else, people started making their ways inside from the balcony and taking their seats on the long table. You looked at the plates- no tags, <i>great. </i>Harry was still standing next to you, probably fighting the same hesitation so you gave him a soft smile when you noticed how tensed his shoulders were. He was about to start sweating, you could tell, and he had been glancing timidly at you for the last two minutes so you decided to start the conversation.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs this seat taken?\u201d You smiled softly, pointing at an empty chair next to the one he was standing behind.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He smiled.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell can I sit next to you?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou can always sit next to me.\u201d He smiled.\u00a0\u201cAnywhere.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Dinner started and finished smoothly. Gemma had cried at least four times and Mike had made a toast for his father\u2019s cat but other than that, dinner had started and finished smoothly. Harry had been taking small sips from his glass of wine, purposely bringing the glass to his lips so he could miss the refills while you had been casually sipping on your water, your wine glass untouched. He discreetly changed your wine glasses after he was done with his and you chuckled lightly as you realized how careful he was with every little detail, as if somebody would suspect of a pregnancy just because you weren\u2019t having wine. He smiled.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan we talk?\u201d He asked.\u00a0</p><p>You simply nodded and followed him out to the balcony, where he took a seat on one of the empty tables. He had surely closed the whole hotel restaurant for his sister and you smiled as you took a seat next to him. Both of you watched the London lights from afar.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI am very sorry for doubting you.\u201d He sighed.\u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t believe I thought the baby wasn\u2019t mine.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMe neither.\u201d You chuckled.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about a little girl just like you but even shorter\u201d You swatted his arm, half amused at his teasing as he smirked\u00a0\u201crunning down the hall and making everything into a mess.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJust like her daddy then.\u201d You teased and he rolled his eyes.\u00a0\u201cI hope he has your eyes though.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d He smiled, staring into your eyes with a smile on his face.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m really sorry.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d You nodded.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry too, you know. I mean we\u2019ve been together for two years now and God knows how <i>insistent\u201d </i>you chose- instead of annoying as fuck so he swatted your arm because he knew what you meant\u00a0\u201cyou\u2019ve been with all that communication shit and the first important decision we have to take together I go and not even tell you about it.\u201d You shook your head.\u00a0\u201cSo I\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you felt like you couldn\u2019t tell me.\u201d He added.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not your fault.\u201d You bit your bottom lip and he nodded.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou know I love you right?\u201d He took your hand in his, caressing his thumb over the back of your hand as you gave him a sweet smile.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re the love of my life and\u201d he chuckled when he caught the way your eyes sparkled at his words\u00a0\u201cI know you\u2019re too good for me but that\u2019s why I\u2019ll spend every day of my life trying to make that up to you. I just&hellip; Listen I know sometimes things are hard between us, I travel a lot and you&hellip; You have to stay home so you can do your thing but for me there\u2019s nothing in this world worth losing you so&hellip; If I have to give up anything, that chair you don\u2019t really like, the house in LA,\u201d he joked\u00a0\u201cmy job&hellip; I would do that. I will do anything for you and our baby.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI would never ask you to do that.\u201d You frowned.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t want you to. One of the reasons I fell in love with you was because of your passion for music. I will never stay in your way.\u201d He nodded. <i>He knew.\u00a0</i>\u201cListen\u201d you sighed\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know how my baby is going to be\u201d You shrugged\u00a0\u201cWhether he\u2019d be tall or short, nice or naughty, whether he\u2019d have brown eyes or green, curly or straight hair&hellip; But what I do know is that they will have the best dad in the world.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He chuckled as he wiped away his tears and then he wrapped his arm around your shoulders and pressed a kiss to your temple, still softly crying after his forehead had rested on the top of your head. You whispered <i>I love you </i>and your breath his his chest. He knew he was the luckiest man alive.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really having my baby.\u201d He chuckled.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d You grinned.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou, Y/N Y/L/N, are going to be the best mum in the world and I\u2019m so lucky both of you are mine.\u201d He smiled.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m terrified.\u201d You giggled, tears streaming down your cheeks and he chuckled as he wiped them away, pressing soft pecks all over your face in between big smiles.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to have my baby now if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d He whispered.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t wanna mess them up.\u201d You giggled or sobbed- you were not sure what was going on inside your mind.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow could you possibly mess anyone up, love?\u201d He pecked your nose.\u00a0\u201cThis&hellip; This might not be the best time but, uh, if we decide it is the right time, I\u2019ll just take a break\u201d he shrugged\u00a0\u201cfor a couple years but, really baby, you gotta trust me and you gotta talk to me and if you do not want to be a mum just yet or ever\u201d he raised his eyebrows\u00a0\u201cthat\u2019s okay too. You know when I said there was nothing in this world worth losing you, I meant it so just&hellip; Don\u2019t be afraid to think out loud with me. I won\u2019t judge you, baby, I know this age gap we\u2019ve never really talked about hasn\u2019t been important to us so far but I guess if I think back about me being 21 and I think about having a baby then&hellip; Well, I don\u2019t know if I would have wanted that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI mean it might not have been intentional\u201d You started, raising your eyebrows but he was already smiling because he knew that look\u00a0\u201cbut&hellip; I\u2019ve also been thinking lately about a little one with curly hair and green eyes, I think we could name him Robin\u201d His smile widened at your suggestion as he nodded\u00a0\u201cand&hellip; I also kind of like the idea of being possibly one of the youngest moms in school, I think it\u2019d make me kind of cool.\u201d You narrowed your eyes, pursing your lips and making him laugh.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cKind of cool? Are you gonna try to be one of those\u00a0<i>cool mums\u201d </i>his fingers drew the quoation marks on the air as you smiled\u00a0\u201cthat embarrass their teenage sons when his mates are over by trying to talk about <i>cool things </i>because<i> they\u2019re still young?\u201d\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cThat was so Anne, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d You smiled.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh, boy, you will be one of those.\u201d He shook his head.\u00a0\u201cHey, bug, you\u2019re lucky I\u2019m here to help you with this one.\u201d He whispered, his eyes burning your belly and you rolled your eyes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy it\u2019s you.\u201d You grinned, looking at him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy it\u2019s you too, lover.\u201d\u00a0</p>",

He ordered a quesadilla, instead of the salad with chicken and raisins he usually had, just because he thought you would have made fun of him for going to a Mexican place and order a salad he could easily make at home.\u00a0</p><p>If you were having a baby you were sure he must be really sad in there because you hadn\u2019t stopped crying all day long. You had woken up with a headache and you had looked to your left, ready to tell Harry so he could make it better, only to find the blank spot and all those pictures of the two of you you had stuck to the wall last time he had been gone for tour. He used to call it <i>the memorial wall </i>and he used to stick candid polaroids of you every time he was home. You wondered how <i>the memorial wall </i>would look like with a scan of the baby on it and then with polaroids of a little one with a chin dirty on mashed veggies. Your lips curled up in a smirk when you thought about how healthy Harry\u2019s pur\u00e9es would be for the little one. Y<i>ou have to eat it as soon as it\u2019s made, baby, because otherwise the leek\u00a0 falls to the bottom and it looks disgusting.</i></p><p><i>Monday</i></p><p><i>14. I am very good at board games, so they would love rainy days with dad.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>15. I make a killer pumpkin soup.</i></p><p><i>16. I used to be baker, so no problem with birthday cakes, birthday cupcakes for school\u2026 I know I haven\u2019t baked in a while but you know what they say- once a baker, always a baker.\u00a0</i></p><p>Gemma had been texting you pictures of bouquets all morning. You wondered if she was texting Harry too. <i>Show them to my brother please. </i>You frowned at that. He hadn\u2019t told her and he had done the right thing- this was her wedding, she didn\u2019t have time to worry about your fight over a baby bump. And talking about the bump, you\u2019d have to send your dress to a tailor. You texted Harry the bouquet pictures. <i>I think roses are prettier than peonies.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Tuesday</i></p><p>Gemma had just left Jeff\u2019s apartment. She had called Harry at least 35 times but he had not picked up once. <i>She probably knows and who wants to talk about it? </i>So she had called you and then she had called Jeff and then she had come and had scolded and hit Harry as he covered his junk with a pillow. <i>And you know what? She\u2019s right, roses are prettier than fucking peonies. </i>He sighed, lying on the couch and hoping to God Gem would say you had said yes.\u00a0</p><p>You opened the door on your tracksuit. Gemma didn\u2019t even ask as she made her way inside your apartment.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWould you like some tea?\u201d You whispered.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She snapped.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t have time for tea. Y/N, I know my brother is an idiot. Lord knows I\u2019ve spent my entire life telling him just that but I\u2019m about to get married and here\u2019s what I hope- that my future husband loves me half as much as my brother loves you. That would be enough.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGreen or white tea?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d She yelled.\u00a0</p><p>You turned around, frowning for Gemma had never, ever, raised her voice at you or even argue with you for the smallest of things.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cListen to me!\u201d She yelled again.\u00a0\u201cOur cook\u2019s wife called saying he\u2019s depressed, Mike\u2019s dad\u2019s cat passed away last night and my wedding dress doesn\u2019t fit because my fucking bum got bigger even thought I\u2019ve been eating celery for a week, so I\u2019m hungry, I\u2019m mad and I\u2019m worried and tomorrow we\u2019re having a nice dinner party so Mike and I can fucking relax and you both are going to be there, do you hear me? You both! And you would be happy and smiley and you would not let my mother know any of this or I would have both your fucking brainless heads on a tray for my wedding day!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You nodded, your lips parted and your brows furrowed over your nose as she took deep breaths and gathered her blond hair on a ponytail.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd I will have a lime blossom tea, please.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You nodded and a second later you placed the tea in front of her, making another one for yourself before you sat down next to her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou should probably have chicken too, otherwise you\u2019d retain fluids and get more swollen. I mean, in between the celery meals.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>She bursted out laughing.\u00a0</p><p>Wednesday night</p><p>You weren\u2019t sure who was going to get there first but you just hoped for your sake Gemma had placed name tags on your seats so you didn\u2019t have to go through the disappointment of seeing Harry sitting next to someone else.\u00a0</p><p>He was standing, not far from the table, when he saw you walking in. It must be true- what they said that women only became prettier when they were pregnant- because you looked like you just came out of a dream. You smiled timidly at those who greeted you and from his spot next to his cousins he could see you were sad and shy and somewhat still scared. He hated to see you like that- he wanted to change everything in the world so you would never be afraid again- but he also remembered it had been his job to make you feel safe and fearless- at least when it came about family- and he had failed you so he was very surprised when you made your way towards him without hesitation the moment your eyes met his.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d You smiled timidly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d He smiled, relief washing over his very soul as soon as he heard your voice.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs your mum here already?\u201d\u00a0</p><p><i>So that was the reason you had come to him- so she wouldn\u2019t know.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He nodded.\u00a0</p><p>Before he could say anything else, people started making their ways inside from the balcony and taking their seats on the long table. You looked at the plates- no tags, <i>great. </i>Harry was still standing next to you, probably fighting the same hesitation so you gave him a soft smile when you noticed how tensed his shoulders were. He was about to start sweating, you could tell, and he had been glancing timidly at you for the last two minutes so you decided to start the conversation.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs this seat taken?\u201d You smiled softly, pointing at an empty chair next to the one he was standing behind.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He smiled.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell can I sit next to you?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou can always sit next to me.\u201d He smiled.\u00a0\u201cAnywhere.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Dinner started and finished smoothly. Gemma had cried at least four times and Mike had made a toast for his father\u2019s cat but other than that, dinner had started and finished smoothly. Harry had been taking small sips from his glass of wine, purposely bringing the glass to his lips so he could miss the refills while you had been casually sipping on your water, your wine glass untouched. He discreetly changed your wine glasses after he was done with his and you chuckled lightly as you realized how careful he was with every little detail, as if somebody would suspect of a pregnancy just because you weren\u2019t having wine. He smiled.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan we talk?\u201d He asked.\u00a0</p><p>You simply nodded and followed him out to the balcony, where he took a seat on one of the empty tables. He had surely closed the whole hotel restaurant for his sister and you smiled as you took a seat next to him. Both of you watched the London lights from afar.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI am very sorry for doubting you.\u201d He sighed.\u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t believe I thought the baby wasn\u2019t mine.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMe neither.\u201d You chuckled.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about a little girl just like you but even shorter\u201d You swatted his arm, half amused at his teasing as he smirked\u00a0\u201crunning down the hall and making everything into a mess.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJust like her daddy then.\u201d You teased and he rolled his eyes.\u00a0\u201cI hope he has your eyes though.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d He smiled, staring into your eyes with a smile on his face.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m really sorry.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d You nodded.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry too, you know. I mean we\u2019ve been together for two years now and God knows how <i>insistent\u201d </i>you chose- instead of annoying as fuck so he swatted your arm because he knew what you meant\u00a0\u201cyou\u2019ve been with all that communication shit and the first important decision we have to take together I go and not even tell you about it.\u201d You shook your head.\u00a0\u201cSo I\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you felt like you couldn\u2019t tell me.\u201d He added.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not your fault.\u201d You bit your bottom lip and he nodded.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou know I love you right?\u201d He took your hand in his, caressing his thumb over the back of your hand as you gave him a sweet smile.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re the love of my life and\u201d he chuckled when he caught the way your eyes sparkled at his words\u00a0\u201cI know you\u2019re too good for me but that\u2019s why I\u2019ll spend every day of my life trying to make that up to you. I just\u2026 Listen I know sometimes things are hard between us, I travel a lot and you\u2026 You have to stay home so you can do your thing but for me there\u2019s nothing in this world worth losing you so\u2026 If I have to give up anything, that chair you don\u2019t really like, the house in LA,\u201d he joked\u00a0\u201cmy job\u2026 I would do that. I will do anything for you and our baby.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI would never ask you to do that.\u201d You frowned.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t want you to. One of the reasons I fell in love with you was because of your passion for music. I will never stay in your way.\u201d He nodded. <i>He knew.\u00a0</i>\u201cListen\u201d you sighed\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know how my baby is going to be\u201d You shrugged\u00a0\u201cWhether he\u2019d be tall or short, nice or naughty, whether he\u2019d have brown eyes or green, curly or straight hair\u2026 But what I do know is that they will have the best dad in the world.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He chuckled as he wiped away his tears and then he wrapped his arm around your shoulders and pressed a kiss to your temple, still softly crying after his forehead had rested on the top of your head. You whispered <i>I love you </i>and your breath his his chest. He knew he was the luckiest man alive.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really having my baby.\u201d He chuckled.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d You grinned.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou, Y/N Y/L/N, are going to be the best mum in the world and I\u2019m so lucky both of you are mine.\u201d He smiled.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m terrified.\u201d You giggled, tears streaming down your cheeks and he chuckled as he wiped them away, pressing soft pecks all over your face in between big smiles.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to have my baby now if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d He whispered.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t wanna mess them up.\u201d You giggled or sobbed- you were not sure what was going on inside your mind.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow could you possibly mess anyone up, love?\u201d He pecked your nose.\u00a0\u201cThis\u2026 This might not be the best time but, uh, if we decide it is the right time, I\u2019ll just take a break\u201d he shrugged\u00a0\u201cfor a couple years but, really baby, you gotta trust me and you gotta talk to me and if you do not want to be a mum just yet or ever\u201d he raised his eyebrows\u00a0\u201cthat\u2019s okay too. You know when I said there was nothing in this world worth losing you, I meant it so just\u2026 Don\u2019t be afraid to think out loud with me. I won\u2019t judge you, baby, I know this age gap we\u2019ve never really talked about hasn\u2019t been important to us so far but I guess if I think back about me being 21 and I think about having a baby then\u2026 Well, I don\u2019t know if I would have wanted that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI mean it might not have been intentional\u201d You started, raising your eyebrows but he was already smiling because he knew that look\u00a0\u201cbut\u2026 I\u2019ve also been thinking lately about a little one with curly hair and green eyes, I think we could name him Robin\u201d His smile widened at your suggestion as he nodded\u00a0\u201cand\u2026 I also kind of like the idea of being possibly one of the youngest moms in school, I think it\u2019d make me kind of cool.\u201d You narrowed your eyes, pursing your lips and making him laugh.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cKind of cool? Are you gonna try to be one of those\u00a0<i>cool mums\u201d </i>his fingers drew the quoation marks on the air as you smiled\u00a0\u201cthat embarrass their teenage sons when his mates are over by trying to talk about <i>cool things </i>because<i> they\u2019re still young?\u201d\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cThat was so Anne, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d You smiled.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh, boy, you will be one of those.\u201d He shook his head.\u00a0\u201cHey, bug, you\u2019re lucky I\u2019m here to help you with this one.\u201d He whispered, his eyes burning your belly and you rolled your eyes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy it\u2019s you.\u201d You grinned, looking at him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy it\u2019s you too, lover.\u201d\u00a0</p></p>",

You took a crumpet out of the freezer and tried to make one of those fruit shakes yourself- strawberries, blueberries and banana would have to do the trick. You were pretty sure lately he had been adding almonds- or was it cashew nuts?- but you didn\u2019t risk it. Maybe you could text him? But then again he hadn\u2019t come back home last night.\u00a0</p><p>Jeff had made a bed for him at the attic- he had just covered the couch with sheets- but he didn\u2019t care for he hadn\u2019t really slept at all. He didn\u2019t think it was possible not to sleep one single minute when one was lying on a bed all night but it turned out once again he was wrong and then he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about all the times he had been wrong in his life. He had been wrong when he was seven and he had stolen that one tale about that bunny who wasn\u2019t good at Maths from the school library and he had been wrong when he was thirteen and he had made fun of Gemma after her performance at the school graduation party. He had been wrong every single time he had lied to his mum and he had been wrong when he didn\u2019t make it on time on one of your dates. He was wrong when he forgot to do the dishes, he had been wrong when he didn\u2019t call you that one time before his concert in Melbourne even though he said he would. He had been wrong when he dismissed your insecurities about Ursula and instead of making you feel like you had nothing to fear, he simply ignored your jealousy and thought you were just beeing needy. He was wrong when he didn\u2019t try to change your mind last night.\u00a0</p><p>You had made way too much smoothie- enough for two people- so you threw the rest down the sink because you remember Harry saying <i>you have to drink it as soon as it\u2019s made, baby, because otherwise the fruit falls to the bottom and it looks disgusting. </i>You found yourself staring at Harry\u2019s mug. It was so Harry- not necessarily the mug but the fact that he would use that old mug you had got him on your trip to Scotland two weeks after you started dating, instead of any other fancy, way better mug from that home deco shop he liked so much. But that was the thing about Harry- he could have anything in the world and still he would never change that <i>special pillow for bad backs </i>your mum had gotten him for Christmas for any other fancy pillow in the world, just because that pillow had been given to him by <i>your mum, </i>just like the mug had been given to him by<i> you.</i>\u00a0Looking down at your belly, you wondered if that part of him would also rather have you all fat and swollen over any other model he could easily snap a finger and have.\u00a0</p><p><i>Sunday\u00a0</i></p><p>He had gone out for lunch with James and Julia after his friend\u2019s many complaints about <i>how long it had been since last time they had seen each other. </i>Julia suggested he could write a letter to you and maybe never send it, but just write down all the reasons why you\u00a0<i>should want </i>to raise a child with him. He ordered a quesadilla, instead of the salad with chicken and raisins he usually had, just because he thought you would have made fun of him for going to a Mexican place and order a salad he could easily make at home.\u00a0</p><p>If you were having a baby you were sure he must be really sad in there because you hadn\u2019t stopped crying all day long. You had woken up with a headache and you had looked to your left, ready to tell Harry so he could make it better, only to find the blank spot and all those pictures of the two of you you had stuck to the wall last time he had been gone for tour. He used to call it <i>the memorial wall </i>and he used to stick candid polaroids of you every time he was home. You wondered how <i>the memorial wall </i>would look like with a scan of the baby on it and then with polaroids of a little one with a chin dirty on mashed veggies. Your lips curled up in a smirk when you thought about how healthy Harry\u2019s pur\u00e9es would be for the little one. Y<i>ou have to eat it as soon as it\u2019s made, baby, because otherwise the leek\u00a0 falls to the bottom and it looks disgusting.</i></p><p><i>Monday</i></p><p><i>14. I am very good at board games, so they would love rainy days with dad.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>15. I make a killer pumpkin soup.</i></p><p><i>16. I used to be baker, so no problem with birthday cakes, birthday cupcakes for school\u2026 I know I haven\u2019t baked in a while but you know what they say- once a baker, always a baker.\u00a0</i></p><p>Gemma had been texting you pictures of bouquets all morning. You wondered if she was texting Harry too. <i>Show them to my brother please. </i>You frowned at that. He hadn\u2019t told her and he had done the right thing- this was her wedding, she didn\u2019t have time to worry about your fight over a baby bump. And talking about the bump, you\u2019d have to send your dress to a tailor. You texted Harry the bouquet pictures. <i>I think roses are prettier than peonies.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Tuesday</i></p><p>Gemma had just left Jeff\u2019s apartment. She had called Harry at least 35 times but he had not picked up once. <i>She probably knows and who wants to talk about it? </i>So she had called you and then she had called Jeff and then she had come and had scolded and hit Harry as he covered his junk with a pillow. <i>And you know what? She\u2019s right, roses are prettier than fucking peonies. </i>He sighed, lying on the couch and hoping to God Gem would say you had said yes.\u00a0</p><p>You opened the door on your tracksuit. Gemma didn\u2019t even ask as she made her way inside your apartment.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWould you like some tea?\u201d You whispered.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She snapped.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t have time for tea. Y/N, I know my brother is an idiot. Lord knows I\u2019ve spent my entire life telling him just that but I\u2019m about to get married and here\u2019s what I hope- that my future husband loves me half as much as my brother loves you. That would be enough.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGreen or white tea?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d She yelled.\u00a0</p><p>You turned around, frowning for Gemma had never, ever, raised her voice at you or even argue with you for the smallest of things.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cListen to me!\u201d She yelled again.\u00a0\u201cOur cook\u2019s wife called saying he\u2019s depressed, Mike\u2019s dad\u2019s cat passed away last night and my wedding dress doesn\u2019t fit because my fucking bum got bigger even thought I\u2019ve been eating celery for a week, so I\u2019m hungry, I\u2019m mad and I\u2019m worried and tomorrow we\u2019re having a nice dinner party so Mike and I can fucking relax and you both are going to be there, do you hear me? You both! And you would be happy and smiley and you would not let my mother know any of this or I would have both your fucking brainless heads on a tray for my wedding day!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You nodded, your lips parted and your brows furrowed over your nose as she took deep breaths and gathered her blond hair on a ponytail.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd I will have a lime blossom tea, please.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You nodded and a second later you placed the tea in front of her, making another one for yourself before you sat down next to her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou should probably have chicken too, otherwise you\u2019d retain fluids and get more swollen. I mean, in between the celery meals.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>She bursted out laughing.\u00a0</p><p>Wednesday night</p><p>You weren\u2019t sure who was going to get there first but you just hoped for your sake Gemma had placed name tags on your seats so you didn\u2019t have to go through the disappointment of seeing Harry sitting next to someone else.\u00a0</p><p>He was standing, not far from the table, when he saw you walking in. It must be true- what they said that women only became prettier when they were pregnant- because you looked like you just came out of a dream. You smiled timidly at those who greeted you and from his spot next to his cousins he could see you were sad and shy and somewhat still scared. He hated to see you like that- he wanted to change everything in the world so you would never be afraid again- but he also remembered it had been his job to make you feel safe and fearless- at least when it came about family- and he had failed you so he was very surprised when you made your way towards him without hesitation the moment your eyes met his.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d You smiled timidly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d He smiled, relief washing over his very soul as soon as he heard your voice.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs your mum here already?\u201d\u00a0</p><p><i>So that was the reason you had come to him- so she wouldn\u2019t know.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He nodded.\u00a0</p><p>Before he could say anything else, people started making their ways inside from the balcony and taking their seats on the long table. You looked at the plates- no tags, <i>great. </i>Harry was still standing next to you, probably fighting the same hesitation so you gave him a soft smile when you noticed how tensed his shoulders were. He was about to start sweating, you could tell, and he had been glancing timidly at you for the last two minutes so you decided to start the conversation.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs this seat taken?\u201d You smiled softly, pointing at an empty chair next to the one he was standing behind.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He smiled.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell can I sit next to you?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou can always sit next to me.\u201d He smiled.\u00a0\u201cAnywhere.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Dinner started and finished smoothly. Gemma had cried at least four times and Mike had made a toast for his father\u2019s cat but other than that, dinner had started and finished smoothly. Harry had been taking small sips from his glass of wine, purposely bringing the glass to his lips so he could miss the refills while you had been casually sipping on your water, your wine glass untouched. He discreetly changed your wine glasses after he was done with his and you chuckled lightly as you realized how careful he was with every little detail, as if somebody would suspect of a pregnancy just because you weren\u2019t having wine. He smiled.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan we talk?\u201d He asked.\u00a0</p><p>You simply nodded and followed him out to the balcony, where he took a seat on one of the empty tables. He had surely closed the whole hotel restaurant for his sister and you smiled as you took a seat next to him. Both of you watched the London lights from afar.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI am very sorry for doubting you.\u201d He sighed.\u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t believe I thought the baby wasn\u2019t mine.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMe neither.\u201d You chuckled.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about a little girl just like you but even shorter\u201d You swatted his arm, half amused at his teasing as he smirked\u00a0\u201crunning down the hall and making everything into a mess.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJust like her daddy then.\u201d You teased and he rolled his eyes.\u00a0\u201cI hope he has your eyes though.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d He smiled, staring into your eyes with a smile on his face.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m really sorry.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d You nodded.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry too, you know. I mean we\u2019ve been together for two years now and God knows how <i>insistent\u201d </i>you chose- instead of annoying as fuck so he swatted your arm because he knew what you meant\u00a0\u201cyou\u2019ve been with all that communication shit and the first important decision we have to take together I go and not even tell you about it.\u201d You shook your head.\u00a0\u201cSo I\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you felt like you couldn\u2019t tell me.\u201d He added.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not your fault.\u201d You bit your bottom lip and he nodded.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou know I love you right?\u201d He took your hand in his, caressing his thumb over the back of your hand as you gave him a sweet smile.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re the love of my life and\u201d he chuckled when he caught the way your eyes sparkled at his words\u00a0\u201cI know you\u2019re too good for me but that\u2019s why I\u2019ll spend every day of my life trying to make that up to you. I just\u2026 Listen I know sometimes things are hard between us, I travel a lot and you\u2026 You have to stay home so you can do your thing but for me there\u2019s nothing in this world worth losing you so\u2026 If I have to give up anything, that chair you don\u2019t really like, the house in LA,\u201d he joked\u00a0\u201cmy job\u2026 I would do that. I will do anything for you and our baby.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI would never ask you to do that.\u201d You frowned.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t want you to. One of the reasons I fell in love with you was because of your passion for music. I will never stay in your way.\u201d He nodded. <i>He knew.\u00a0</i>\u201cListen\u201d you sighed\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know how my baby is going to be\u201d You shrugged\u00a0\u201cWhether he\u2019d be tall or short, nice or naughty, whether he\u2019d have brown eyes or green, curly or straight hair\u2026 But what I do know is that they will have the best dad in the world.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He chuckled as he wiped away his tears and then he wrapped his arm around your shoulders and pressed a kiss to your temple, still softly crying after his forehead had rested on the top of your head. You whispered <i>I love you </i>and your breath his his chest. He knew he was the luckiest man alive.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really having my baby.\u201d He chuckled.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d You grinned.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou, Y/N Y/L/N, are going to be the best mum in the world and I\u2019m so lucky both of you are mine.\u201d He smiled.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m terrified.\u201d You giggled, tears streaming down your cheeks and he chuckled as he wiped them away, pressing soft pecks all over your face in between big smiles.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to have my baby now if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d He whispered.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t wanna mess them up.\u201d You giggled or sobbed- you were not sure what was going on inside your mind.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow could you possibly mess anyone up, love?\u201d He pecked your nose.\u00a0\u201cThis\u2026 This might not be the best time but, uh, if we decide it is the right time, I\u2019ll just take a break\u201d he shrugged\u00a0\u201cfor a couple years but, really baby, you gotta trust me and you gotta talk to me and if you do not want to be a mum just yet or ever\u201d he raised his eyebrows\u00a0\u201cthat\u2019s okay too. You know when I said there was nothing in this world worth losing you, I meant it so just\u2026 Don\u2019t be afraid to think out loud with me. I won\u2019t judge you, baby, I know this age gap we\u2019ve never really talked about hasn\u2019t been important to us so far but I guess if I think back about me being 21 and I think about having a baby then\u2026 Well, I don\u2019t know if I would have wanted that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI mean it might not have been intentional\u201d You started, raising your eyebrows but he was already smiling because he knew that look\u00a0\u201cbut\u2026 I\u2019ve also been thinking lately about a little one with curly hair and green eyes, I think we could name him Robin\u201d His smile widened at your suggestion as he nodded\u00a0\u201cand\u2026 I also kind of like the idea of being possibly one of the youngest moms in school, I think it\u2019d make me kind of cool.\u201d You narrowed your eyes, pursing your lips and making him laugh.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cKind of cool? Are you gonna try to be one of those\u00a0<i>cool mums\u201d </i>his fingers drew the quoation marks on the air as you smiled\u00a0\u201cthat embarrass their teenage sons when his mates are over by trying to talk about <i>cool things </i>because<i> they\u2019re still young?\u201d\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cThat was so Anne, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d You smiled.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh, boy, you will be one of those.\u201d He shook his head.\u00a0\u201cHey, bug, you\u2019re lucky I\u2019m here to help you with this one.\u201d He whispered, his eyes burning your belly and you rolled your eyes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy it\u2019s you.\u201d You grinned, looking at him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy it\u2019s you too, lover.\u201d\u00a0</p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h1>Haze 2</h1><p><i>Saturday</i></p><p>The flowers on the glass over the dinning table were withering, the vanilla candle hadn&rsquo;t been lighted, there were no crumbs on the kitchen counter. You took a crumpet out of the freezer and tried to make one of those fruit shakes yourself- strawberries, blueberries and banana would have to do the trick. You were pretty sure lately he had been adding almonds- or was it cashew nuts?- but you didn&rsquo;t risk it. Maybe you could text him? But then again he hadn&rsquo;t come back home last night.&nbsp;</p><p>Jeff had made a bed for him at the attic- he had just covered the couch with sheets- but he didn&rsquo;t care for he hadn&rsquo;t really slept at all. He didn&rsquo;t think it was possible not to sleep one single minute when one was lying on a bed all night but it turned out once again he was wrong and then he couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about all the times he had been wrong in his life. He had been wrong when he was seven and he had stolen that one tale about that bunny who wasn&rsquo;t good at Maths from the school library and he had been wrong when he was thirteen and he had made fun of Gemma after her performance at the school graduation party. He had been wrong every single time he had lied to his mum and he had been wrong when he didn&rsquo;t make it on time on one of your dates. He was wrong when he forgot to do the dishes, he had been wrong when he didn&rsquo;t call you that one time before his concert in Melbourne even though he said he would. He had been wrong when he dismissed your insecurities about Ursula and instead of making you feel like you had nothing to fear, he simply ignored your jealousy and thought you were just beeing needy. He was wrong when he didn&rsquo;t try to change your mind last night.&nbsp;</p><p>You had made way too much smoothie- enough for two people- so you threw the rest down the sink because you remember Harry saying <i>you have to drink it as soon as it&rsquo;s made, baby, because otherwise the fruit falls to the bottom and it looks disgusting. </i>You found yourself staring at Harry&rsquo;s mug. It was so Harry- not necessarily the mug but the fact that he would use that old mug you had got him on your trip to Scotland two weeks after you started dating, instead of any other fancy, way better mug from that home deco shop he liked so much. But that was the thing about Harry- he could have anything in the world and still he would never change that <i>special pillow for bad backs </i>your mum had gotten him for Christmas for any other fancy pillow in the world, just because that pillow had been given to him by <i>your mum, </i>just like the mug had been given to him by<i> you.</i>&nbsp;Looking down at your belly, you wondered if that part of him would also rather have you all fat and swollen over any other model he could easily snap a finger and have.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Sunday&nbsp;</i></p><p>He had gone out for lunch with James and Julia after his friend&rsquo;s many complaints about <i>how long it had been since last time they had seen each other. </i>Julia suggested he could write a letter to you and maybe never send it, but just write down all the reasons why you&nbsp;<i>should want </i>to raise a child with him. He ordered a quesadilla, instead of the salad with chicken and raisins he usually had, just because he thought you would have made fun of him for going to a Mexican place and order a salad he could easily make at home.&nbsp;</p><p>If you were having a baby you were sure he must be really sad in there because you hadn&rsquo;t stopped crying all day long. You had woken up with a headache and you had looked to your left, ready to tell Harry so he could make it better, only to find the blank spot and all those pictures of the two of you you had stuck to the wall last time he had been gone for tour. He used to call it <i>the memorial wall </i>and he used to stick candid polaroids of you every time he was home. You wondered how <i>the memorial wall </i>would look like with a scan of the baby on it and then with polaroids of a little one with a chin dirty on mashed veggies. Your lips curled up in a smirk when you thought about how healthy Harry&rsquo;s pur&eacute;es would be for the little one. Y<i>ou have to eat it as soon as it&rsquo;s made, baby, because otherwise the leek&nbsp; falls to the bottom and it looks disgusting.</i></p><p><i>Monday</i></p><p><i>14. I am very good at board games, so they would love rainy days with dad.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>15. I make a killer pumpkin soup.</i></p><p><i>16. I used to be baker, so no problem with birthday cakes, birthday cupcakes for school&hellip; I know I haven&rsquo;t baked in a while but you know what they say- once a baker, always a baker.&nbsp;</i></p><p>Gemma had been texting you pictures of bouquets all morning. You wondered if she was texting Harry too. <i>Show them to my brother please. </i>You frowned at that. He hadn&rsquo;t told her and he had done the right thing- this was her wedding, she didn&rsquo;t have time to worry about your fight over a baby bump. And talking about the bump, you&rsquo;d have to send your dress to a tailor. You texted Harry the bouquet pictures. <i>I think roses are prettier than peonies.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Tuesday</i></p><p>Gemma had just left Jeff&rsquo;s apartment. She had called Harry at least 35 times but he had not picked up once. <i>She probably knows and who wants to talk about it? </i>So she had called you and then she had called Jeff and then she had come and had scolded and hit Harry as he covered his junk with a pillow. <i>And you know what? She&rsquo;s right, roses are prettier than fucking peonies. </i>He sighed, lying on the couch and hoping to God Gem would say you had said yes.&nbsp;</p><p>You opened the door on your tracksuit. Gemma didn&rsquo;t even ask as she made her way inside your apartment.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Would you like some tea?&rdquo; You whispered.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; She snapped.&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have time for tea. Y/N, I know my brother is an idiot. Lord knows I&rsquo;ve spent my entire life telling him just that but I&rsquo;m about to get married and here&rsquo;s what I hope- that my future husband loves me half as much as my brother loves you.

It is the talented and beautiful YN!\u2019 Nick announced on the radio. You were on the radio 1 breakfast show with Nick to promote your new album.</p><p>\u2018Hello.\u2019 You said in the mic.</p><p>\u2018Hello YN, how are you?\u2019 Nick asked. \u2018I am really good, a bit tired, but good.\u2019 You said. </p><p>\u2018Good to hear. So, new album coming up. What can we expect?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Well the album has a bit of everything really. I didn\u2019t stick to one genre, I just wrote songs that came naturally and the ones I loved the best just came on the album. It wasn\u2019t like I wanted one type on \u2018mood\u2019 for the album.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Your latest single \u2018yellow\u2019 is a big hit so I am sure the rest of the album is going to great too.\u2019 Nick said and you thanked him.</p><p>\u2018Talking about your single, it is a bit of a love song, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Yes, it is. It was a song that really just wrote itself and I am in love with it. It talks about love in a real way I guess and not in a way how everything is perfect.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I need to ask this so I am very sorry but is the song about somebody in particular?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018I know people really want to know this stuff but I am sad to announce that the song isn\u2019t about one person in particular. I wrote this song out of many experiences I had with love. The song doesn\u2019t only talk about just my romantic history but also about friendship/ family.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s great. We will be chatting with YN a little later but first some music. Here is YN\u2019s latest single Yellow.\u2019 Nick announced and muted the mics. You putted of your headphones and took a sip from your coffee.</p><p>\u2018I really am a big fan of your music.\u2019 Nick said and you smiled. \u2018Thank you so much, I am a fan of your show.\u2019 You said and it was true. You may live in LA now but when you were in London last year with a couple of friends, you woke up to his show and you really enjoyed his humor. You often put on his show when you are home alone.</p><p>\u2018Aren\u2019t you sad it is going to end?\u2019 You asked, you knew tomorrow was his last breakfast show. \u2018I am not quitting radio, I am just stopping to do the breakfast show and honestly I am not mad about not having to set an alarm.\u2019 He said. You laughed and nodded. \u2018Yeah I wouldn\u2019t mind not having to set an alarm for a while either.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Starting in 30 seconds.\u2019 A producer called and you both went back to your sides of the table and putted on your headphones.</p><p>\u2018Good morning to those who just woke up, we are here with YN.\u2019 Nick announced when the song was over.</p><p>\u2018Good morning everybody.\u2019 You said.</p><p>\u2018YN, you are known for being quite active on Instagram, is social media something you really like?\u2019 Nick asked.</p><p>\u2018Social media is a good way of connecting with people and I like Instagram because I love taking pictures. About me being very active, I just recently started being really active. I used to be scared about what I can and can\u2019t post but I think I kind of figured it out.\u2019 You said.</p><p>\u2018Aren\u2019t you scared people are going to know too much?\u2019 Nick asked.</p><p>\u2018No, like I just said I think I figured out a good balance between sharing but not oversharing. At the end of the day I show what I want you to see.\u2019 You said.</p><p>\u2018You also give the most amazing captions and comments on your photos, they are just amazing.\u2019 Nick said. You laughed and thanked him. </p><p>\u2018Before you walked in, I was like I want to be on this girls Instagram and see what she would caption it.\u2019 Nick said with a laugh.</p><p>\u2018Well, we can take a picture and I will make your wish come true.\u2019 You said the last part in a very posh English accent.</p><p>You took another break and talked some more about performing and writing songs. Before you knew the interview was done. </p><p>\u2018It was really nice to meet you.\u2019 You said while getting up from your chair. \u2018You too darling.\u2019 Nick said and you gave each other a hug. \u2018YN?\u2019 Nick asked and you looked at him. \u2018I am having this little dinner party tonight because tomorrow will be my last show. I would really like for you to come. If you are free?\u2019 Nick asked and you smiled wide. You had an amazing time with Nick on the radio.</p><p>\u2018I would love to come.\u2019 You said and you exchanged phone numbers.</p><p>You left the building and got a text from Nick already saying, \u2018We are going to be great friends.\u2019 You couldn\u2019t help laughing because you knew he was right.</p><p>.</p><p>You were late and god do you hate to be late somewhere. The meeting you had to attend kept dragging on. You walked out of your taxi after paying and thanking the kind man and walked towards the restaurant. 30 minutes late. You had texted Nick that you were going to be late and he said they would wait for you to arrive. You were nervous because these are all people you don\u2019t know and now they had to wait for their dinner because of you.</p><p>You walked in the restaurant and told the woman at the front that you were here for Nick Grimshaw. She took a menu and walked you to a seperate room in the restaurant. When she opened the door, the room was filled with chatter. There was a large table set in the middle of the room and their were about 20 people sitting around the table. The woman handed you the menu and walked back. You thanked her and took a deep breath before walking more into the room.</p><p>Nick noticed you and yelled \u2018YN!\u2019 which made everybody to stop talking and look at you. You smiled and walked to Nick. You handed him the present you got your assistant to get him. \u2018Hi Nick.\u2019 you said and he stood up to give you a hug. You looked at the rest of the table and said, \u2018So sorry that you had to wait.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Hey, we are all still alive so don\u2019t worry about it.\u2019 Nick said and added, \u2018Guys this is YN, she is my new best friend so be nice otherwise I will kick your asses.\u2019 You laughed and waved at the table. \u2018You can sit down there.\u2019 Nick said to you and pointed at a spot where there were two empty chairs. You went over to your place but said hello to everybody first, introducing yourself and getting all of their names. When you got to the empty chairs you looked and saw that there was a pink phone laying on one of those chairs, so you took place on the other one.</p><p>\u2018Let\u2019s order, shall we?\u2019 Nick said and everybody opened their menu, the chatter returning to the table. You opened yours and looked at all the choices the restaurant has. </p><p>\u2018So YN, I just want to say that I really like your new song.\u2019 The girl next to you said, her name was Fiona and she was a colleague of Nick\u2019s on the radio. \u2018Thank you so much, Fiona. I really enjoy the breakfast show. I especially love your and Nick\u2019s banter. Always puts a smile on my face.\u2019 You said and she thanked you. </p><p>You were both talking about what you were going to order when you felt a presence next to you. Before you could look next to you, Nick said, \u2018Ah how nice of you to join us again H.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Shut up Nick.\u2019 Harry said in a teasing tone and sat down next to you. Everybody went back to looking at their menus. Harry looked at you and extended his hand saying, \u2018YN, right?\u2019 You nodded and shaked his hand saying a \u2018Nice to meet you.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018I am a big fan of the new song, it\u2019s a real hit.\u2019 He said and you laughed. \u2018Thank you, I really enjoy your music too. The album is amazing.\u2019 You said and Harry was about to say something when the waiter showed up asking what everybody wanted to eat.</p><p>\u2018Oh god, I don\u2019t know what to take.\u2019 You whispered to yourself. \u2018I recommend the risotto, I always take it when I come here. It is the best thing to get.\u2019 Harry said.</p><p>\u2018Okay but how do you know it is the best thing to get when you always order the same thing?\u2019 You asked. He gave you a surprised smile ans said, \u2018Touche, but why go away from something that you know is good.\u2019 He said. \u2018I like to try new things, makes life exciting.\u2019 You said and ordered the risotto when the waiter looked at you. </p><p>\u2018I will take the summer pasta.\u2019 Harry said and you looked at him. \u2018Summer pasta?\u2019 You asked and he looked at you. \u2018Well you ordered the thing I recommended you, might as well follow your advice.\u2019 He said and you smiled, shaking your head.</p><p>About 30 minutes later, your dinner arrived. The risotto looked really good and the smell just made you want to dig in right away. Harry\u2019s pasta also looked really good. You took a bite from the risotto and couldn\u2019t help but moan at the taste. Harry looked at you and said with a teasing smile, \u2018Good right?\u2019 You nodded, while taking another bite.</p><p>\u2018How\u2019s the pasta?\u2019 You asked. \u2018It\u2019s really good actually, really happy I took your advice.\u2019 He said and you both ate in silence enjoying the taste of the amazing food.</p><p>The further the evening went the more noise their was in the room. Everybody was talking and drinking and just having fun really.

It is the talented and beautiful YN!\u2019 Nick announced on the radio. You were on the radio 1 breakfast show with Nick to promote your new album.</p><p>\u2018Hello.\u2019 You said in the mic.</p><p>\u2018Hello YN, how are you?\u2019 Nick asked. \u2018I am really good, a bit tired, but good.\u2019 You said. </p><p>\u2018Good to hear. So, new album coming up. What can we expect?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Well the album has a bit of everything really. I didn\u2019t stick to one genre, I just wrote songs that came naturally and the ones I loved the best just came on the album. It wasn\u2019t like I wanted one type on \u2018mood\u2019 for the album.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Your latest single \u2018yellow\u2019 is a big hit so I am sure the rest of the album is going to great too.\u2019 Nick said and you thanked him.</p><p>\u2018Talking about your single, it is a bit of a love song, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Yes, it is. It was a song that really just wrote itself and I am in love with it. It talks about love in a real way I guess and not in a way how everything is perfect.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I need to ask this so I am very sorry but is the song about somebody in particular?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018I know people really want to know this stuff but I am sad to announce that the song isn\u2019t about one person in particular. I wrote this song out of many experiences I had with love. The song doesn\u2019t only talk about just my romantic history but also about friendship/ family.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s great. We will be chatting with YN a little later but first some music. Here is YN\u2019s latest single Yellow.\u2019 Nick announced and muted the mics. You putted of your headphones and took a sip from your coffee.</p><p>\u2018I really am a big fan of your music.\u2019 Nick said and you smiled. \u2018Thank you so much, I am a fan of your show.\u2019 You said and it was true. You may live in LA now but when you were in London last year with a couple of friends, you woke up to his show and you really enjoyed his humor. You often put on his show when you are home alone.</p><p>\u2018Aren\u2019t you sad it is going to end?\u2019 You asked, you knew tomorrow was his last breakfast show. \u2018I am not quitting radio, I am just stopping to do the breakfast show and honestly I am not mad about not having to set an alarm.\u2019 He said. You laughed and nodded. \u2018Yeah I wouldn\u2019t mind not having to set an alarm for a while either.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Starting in 30 seconds.\u2019 A producer called and you both went back to your sides of the table and putted on your headphones.</p><p>\u2018Good morning to those who just woke up, we are here with YN.\u2019 Nick announced when the song was over.</p><p>\u2018Good morning everybody.\u2019 You said.</p><p>\u2018YN, you are known for being quite active on Instagram, is social media something you really like?\u2019 Nick asked.</p><p>\u2018Social media is a good way of connecting with people and I like Instagram because I love taking pictures. About me being very active, I just recently started being really active. I used to be scared about what I can and can\u2019t post but I think I kind of figured it out.\u2019 You said.</p><p>\u2018Aren\u2019t you scared people are going to know too much?\u2019 Nick asked.</p><p>\u2018No, like I just said I think I figured out a good balance between sharing but not oversharing. At the end of the day I show what I want you to see.\u2019 You said.</p><p>\u2018You also give the most amazing captions and comments on your photos, they are just amazing.\u2019 Nick said. You laughed and thanked him. </p><p>\u2018Before you walked in, I was like I want to be on this girls Instagram and see what she would caption it.\u2019 Nick said with a laugh.</p><p>\u2018Well, we can take a picture and I will make your wish come true.\u2019 You said the last part in a very posh English accent.</p><p>You took another break and talked some more about performing and writing songs. Before you knew the interview was done. </p><p>\u2018It was really nice to meet you.\u2019 You said while getting up from your chair. \u2018You too darling.\u2019 Nick said and you gave each other a hug. \u2018YN?\u2019 Nick asked and you looked at him. \u2018I am having this little dinner party tonight because tomorrow will be my last show. I would really like for you to come. If you are free?\u2019 Nick asked and you smiled wide. You had an amazing time with Nick on the radio.</p><p>\u2018I would love to come.\u2019 You said and you exchanged phone numbers.</p><p>You left the building and got a text from Nick already saying, \u2018We are going to be great friends.\u2019 You couldn\u2019t help laughing because you knew he was right.</p><p>.</p><p>You were late and god do you hate to be late somewhere. The meeting you had to attend kept dragging on. You walked out of your taxi after paying and thanking the kind man and walked towards the restaurant. 30 minutes late. You had texted Nick that you were going to be late and he said they would wait for you to arrive. You were nervous because these are all people you don\u2019t know and now they had to wait for their dinner because of you.</p><p>You walked in the restaurant and told the woman at the front that you were here for Nick Grimshaw. She took a menu and walked you to a seperate room in the restaurant. When she opened the door, the room was filled with chatter. There was a large table set in the middle of the room and their were about 20 people sitting around the table. The woman handed you the menu and walked back. You thanked her and took a deep breath before walking more into the room.</p><p>Nick noticed you and yelled \u2018YN!\u2019 which made everybody to stop talking and look at you. You smiled and walked to Nick. You handed him the present you got your assistant to get him. \u2018Hi Nick.\u2019 you said and he stood up to give you a hug. You looked at the rest of the table and said, \u2018So sorry that you had to wait.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Hey, we are all still alive so don\u2019t worry about it.\u2019 Nick said and added, \u2018Guys this is YN, she is my new best friend so be nice otherwise I will kick your asses.\u2019 You laughed and waved at the table. \u2018You can sit down there.\u2019 Nick said to you and pointed at a spot where there were two empty chairs. You went over to your place but said hello to everybody first, introducing yourself and getting all of their names. When you got to the empty chairs you looked and saw that there was a pink phone laying on one of those chairs, so you took place on the other one.</p><p>\u2018Let\u2019s order, shall we?\u2019 Nick said and everybody opened their menu, the chatter returning to the table. You opened yours and looked at all the choices the restaurant has. </p><p>\u2018So YN, I just want to say that I really like your new song.\u2019 The girl next to you said, her name was Fiona and she was a colleague of Nick\u2019s on the radio. \u2018Thank you so much, Fiona. I really enjoy the breakfast show. I especially love your and Nick\u2019s banter. Always puts a smile on my face.\u2019 You said and she thanked you. </p><p>You were both talking about what you were going to order when you felt a presence next to you. Before you could look next to you, Nick said, \u2018Ah how nice of you to join us again H.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Shut up Nick.\u2019 Harry said in a teasing tone and sat down next to you. Everybody went back to looking at their menus. Harry looked at you and extended his hand saying, \u2018YN, right?\u2019 You nodded and shaked his hand saying a \u2018Nice to meet you.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018I am a big fan of the new song, it\u2019s a real hit.\u2019 He said and you laughed. \u2018Thank you, I really enjoy your music too. The album is amazing.\u2019 You said and Harry was about to say something when the waiter showed up asking what everybody wanted to eat.</p><p>\u2018Oh god, I don\u2019t know what to take.\u2019 You whispered to yourself. \u2018I recommend the risotto, I always take it when I come here. It is the best thing to get.\u2019 Harry said.</p><p>\u2018Okay but how do you know it is the best thing to get when you always order the same thing?\u2019 You asked. He gave you a surprised smile ans said, \u2018Touche, but why go away from something that you know is good.\u2019 He said. \u2018I like to try new things, makes life exciting.\u2019 You said and ordered the risotto when the waiter looked at you. </p><p>\u2018I will take the summer pasta.\u2019 Harry said and you looked at him. \u2018Summer pasta?\u2019 You asked and he looked at you. \u2018Well you ordered the thing I recommended you, might as well follow your advice.\u2019 He said and you smiled, shaking your head.</p><p>About 30 minutes later, your dinner arrived. The risotto looked really good and the smell just made you want to dig in right away. Harry\u2019s pasta also looked really good. You took a bite from the risotto and couldn\u2019t help but moan at the taste. Harry looked at you and said with a teasing smile, \u2018Good right?\u2019 You nodded, while taking another bite.</p><p>\u2018How\u2019s the pasta?\u2019 You asked. \u2018It\u2019s really good actually, really happy I took your advice.\u2019 He said and you both ate in silence enjoying the taste of the amazing food.</p><p>The further the evening went the more noise their was in the room. Everybody was talking and drinking and just having fun really. You weren\u2019t drunk but you could feel the alcohol in your body. </p><p>You and Harry were both laughing at something that happened to him a while back on stage. You had been talking to each other the whole night and you were really enjoying yourself with him.</p><p>You both left the restaurant at around 1 am, saying goodbye and going your separate ways. You had such a great time tonight with Harry and you had exchanged phone numbers during the evening. </p><p>Let\u2019s say you really hope he would call to hang out again soon. </p><p>____________</p><p><a href=\"https://lovelyharrystories.tumblr.com/post/177229793390/singeryn-series\">MASTERLIST\u00a0 </a>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<a href=\"https://lovelyharrystories.tumblr.com/post/177339501640/instagram-one-previous-part-next-part\">NEXT PART</a></p><p>____________</p><p>SOO, chapter one\u2026</p><p><a href=\"https://lovelyharrystories.tumblr.com/ask\">Please let me know what you think of it, I really love to hear feedback.</a></p></p>",

Before you could look next to you, Nick said, \u2018Ah how nice of you to join us again H.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Shut up Nick.\u2019 Harry said in a teasing tone and sat down next to you. Everybody went back to looking at their menus. Harry looked at you and extended his hand saying, \u2018YN, right?\u2019 You nodded and shaked his hand saying a \u2018Nice to meet you.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018I am a big fan of the new song, it\u2019s a real hit.\u2019 He said and you laughed. \u2018Thank you, I really enjoy your music too. The album is amazing.\u2019 You said and Harry was about to say something when the waiter showed up asking what everybody wanted to eat.</p><p>\u2018Oh god, I don\u2019t know what to take.\u2019 You whispered to yourself. \u2018I recommend the risotto, I always take it when I come here. It is the best thing to get.\u2019 Harry said.</p><p>\u2018Okay but how do you know it is the best thing to get when you always order the same thing?\u2019 You asked. He gave you a surprised smile ans said, \u2018Touche, but why go away from something that you know is good.\u2019 He said. \u2018I like to try new things, makes life exciting.\u2019 You said and ordered the risotto when the waiter looked at you. </p><p>\u2018I will take the summer pasta.\u2019 Harry said and you looked at him. \u2018Summer pasta?\u2019 You asked and he looked at you. \u2018Well you ordered the thing I recommended you, might as well follow your advice.\u2019 He said and you smiled, shaking your head.</p><p>About 30 minutes later, your dinner arrived. The risotto looked really good and the smell just made you want to dig in right away. Harry\u2019s pasta also looked really good. You took a bite from the risotto and couldn\u2019t help but moan at the taste. Harry looked at you and said with a teasing smile, \u2018Good right?\u2019 You nodded, while taking another bite.</p><p>\u2018How\u2019s the pasta?\u2019 You asked. \u2018It\u2019s really good actually, really happy I took your advice.\u2019 He said and you both ate in silence enjoying the taste of the amazing food.</p><p>The further the evening went the more noise their was in the room. Everybody was talking and drinking and just having fun really. You weren\u2019t drunk but you could feel the alcohol in your body. </p><p>You and Harry were both laughing at something that happened to him a while back on stage. You had been talking to each other the whole night and you were really enjoying yourself with him.</p><p>You both left the restaurant at around 1 am, saying goodbye and going your separate ways. You had such a great time tonight with Harry and you had exchanged phone numbers during the evening. </p><p>Let\u2019s say you really hope he would call to hang out again soon. </p><p>____________</p><p><a href=\"https://lovelyharrystories.tumblr.com/post/177229793390/singeryn-series\">MASTERLIST\u00a0 </a>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<a href=\"https://lovelyharrystories.tumblr.com/post/177339501640/instagram-one-previous-part-next-part\">NEXT PART</a></p><p>____________</p><p>SOO, chapter one\u2026</p><p><a href=\"https://lovelyharrystories.tumblr.com/ask\">Please let me know what you think of it, I really love to hear feedback.</a></p></p>",

It is the talented and beautiful YN!&rsquo; Nick announced on the radio. You were on the radio 1 breakfast show with Nick to promote your new album.</p><p>&lsquo;Hello.&rsquo; You said in the mic.</p><p>&lsquo;Hello YN, how are you?&rsquo; Nick asked. &lsquo;I am really good, a bit tired, but good.&rsquo; You said. </p><p>&lsquo;Good to hear. So, new album coming up. What can we expect?&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;Well the album has a bit of everything really. I didn&rsquo;t stick to one genre, I just wrote songs that came naturally and the ones I loved the best just came on the album. It wasn&rsquo;t like I wanted one type on &lsquo;mood&rsquo; for the album.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Your latest single &lsquo;yellow&rsquo; is a big hit so I am sure the rest of the album is going to great too.&rsquo; Nick said and you thanked him.</p><p>&lsquo;Talking about your single, it is a bit of a love song, isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;Yes, it is. It was a song that really just wrote itself and I am in love with it. It talks about love in a real way I guess and not in a way how everything is perfect.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;I need to ask this so I am very sorry but is the song about somebody in particular?&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;I know people really want to know this stuff but I am sad to announce that the song isn&rsquo;t about one person in particular. I wrote this song out of many experiences I had with love. The song doesn&rsquo;t only talk about just my romantic history but also about friendship/ family.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s great. We will be chatting with YN a little later but first some music. Here is YN&rsquo;s latest single Yellow.&rsquo; Nick announced and muted the mics. You putted of your headphones and took a sip from your coffee.</p><p>&lsquo;I really am a big fan of your music.&rsquo; Nick said and you smiled. &lsquo;Thank you so much, I am a fan of your show.&rsquo; You said and it was true. You may live in LA now but when you were in London last year with a couple of friends, you woke up to his show and you really enjoyed his humor. You often put on his show when you are home alone.</p><p>&lsquo;Aren&rsquo;t you sad it is going to end?&rsquo; You asked, you knew tomorrow was his last breakfast show. &lsquo;I am not quitting radio, I am just stopping to do the breakfast show and honestly I am not mad about not having to set an alarm.&rsquo; He said. You laughed and nodded. &lsquo;Yeah I wouldn&rsquo;t mind not having to set an alarm for a while either.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Starting in 30 seconds.&rsquo; A producer called and you both went back to your sides of the table and putted on your headphones.</p><p>&lsquo;Good morning to those who just woke up, we are here with YN.&rsquo; Nick announced when the song was over.</p><p>&lsquo;Good morning everybody.&rsquo; You said.</p><p>&lsquo;YN, you are known for being quite active on Instagram, is social media something you really like?&rsquo; Nick asked.</p><p>&lsquo;Social media is a good way of connecting with people and I like Instagram because I love taking pictures. About me being very active, I just recently started being really active. I used to be scared about what I can and can&rsquo;t post but I think I kind of figured it out.&rsquo; You said.</p><p>&lsquo;Aren&rsquo;t you scared people are going to know too much?&rsquo; Nick asked.</p><p>&lsquo;No, like I just said I think I figured out a good balance between sharing but not oversharing. At the end of the day I show what I want you to see.&rsquo; You said.</p><p>&lsquo;You also give the most amazing captions and comments on your photos, they are just amazing.&rsquo; Nick said. You laughed and thanked him. </p><p>&lsquo;Before you walked in, I was like I want to be on this girls Instagram and see what she would caption it.&rsquo; Nick said with a laugh.</p><p>&lsquo;Well, we can take a picture and I will make your wish come true.&rsquo; You said the last part in a very posh English accent.</p><p>You took another break and talked some more about performing and writing songs. Before you knew the interview was done. </p><p>&lsquo;It was really nice to meet you.&rsquo; You said while getting up from your chair. &lsquo;You too darling.&rsquo; Nick said and you gave each other a hug. &lsquo;YN?&rsquo; Nick asked and you looked at him. &lsquo;I am having this little dinner party tonight because tomorrow will be my last show. I would really like for you to come. If you are free?&rsquo; Nick asked and you smiled wide. You had an amazing time with Nick on the radio.</p><p>&lsquo;I would love to come.&rsquo; You said and you exchanged phone numbers.</p><p>You left the building and got a text from Nick already saying, &lsquo;We are going to be great friends.&rsquo; You couldn&rsquo;t help laughing because you knew he was right.</p><p>.</p><p>You were late and god do you hate to be late somewhere. The meeting you had to attend kept dragging on. You walked out of your taxi after paying and thanking the kind man and walked towards the restaurant. 30 minutes late. You had texted Nick that you were going to be late and he said they would wait for you to arrive. You were nervous because these are all people you don&rsquo;t know and now they had to wait for their dinner because of you.</p><p>You walked in the restaurant and told the woman at the front that you were here for Nick Grimshaw. She took a menu and walked you to a seperate room in the restaurant. When she opened the door, the room was filled with chatter. There was a large table set in the middle of the room and their were about 20 people sitting around the table. The woman handed you the menu and walked back. You thanked her and took a deep breath before walking more into the room.</p><p>Nick noticed you and yelled &lsquo;YN!&rsquo; which made everybody to stop talking and look at you. You smiled and walked to Nick. You handed him the present you got your assistant to get him. &lsquo;Hi Nick.&rsquo; you said and he stood up to give you a hug. You looked at the rest of the table and said, &lsquo;So sorry that you had to wait.&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;Hey, we are all still alive so don&rsquo;t worry about it.&rsquo; Nick said and added, &lsquo;Guys this is YN, she is my new best friend so be nice otherwise I will kick your asses.&rsquo; You laughed and waved at the table. &lsquo;You can sit down there.&rsquo; Nick said to you and pointed at a spot where there were two empty chairs. You went over to your place but said hello to everybody first, introducing yourself and getting all of their names. When you got to the empty chairs you looked and saw that there was a pink phone laying on one of those chairs, so you took place on the other one.</p><p>&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s order, shall we?&rsquo; Nick said and everybody opened their menu, the chatter returning to the table. You opened yours and looked at all the choices the restaurant has. </p><p>&lsquo;So YN, I just want to say that I really like your new song.&rsquo; The girl next to you said, her name was Fiona and she was a colleague of Nick&rsquo;s on the radio. &lsquo;Thank you so much, Fiona. I really enjoy the breakfast show. I especially love your and Nick&rsquo;s banter. Always puts a smile on my face.&rsquo; You said and she thanked you. </p><p>You were both talking about what you were going to order when you felt a presence next to you. Before you could look next to you, Nick said, &lsquo;Ah how nice of you to join us again H.&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;Shut up Nick.&rsquo; Harry said in a teasing tone and sat down next to you. Everybody went back to looking at their menus. Harry looked at you and extended his hand saying, &lsquo;YN, right?&rsquo; You nodded and shaked his hand saying a &lsquo;Nice to meet you.&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;I am a big fan of the new song, it&rsquo;s a real hit.&rsquo; He said and you laughed. &lsquo;Thank you, I really enjoy your music too.
