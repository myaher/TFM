Catching wind of Jon&rsquo;s resurrection, Littlefinger plots to use him to secure Sansa&rsquo;s seat in Winterfell, but he isn&rsquo;t the only one with eyes on the North. Back in the Riverlands, a fugitive Brynden Tully finds a mysterious grey- eyed girl at the Twins as Bran Stark returns from Beyond the Wall. Meanwhile, Cersei Lannister rules from King&rsquo;s Landing as three Dragons circle the island of Dragonstone. The seven kingdoms are at war and the Night King is coming. Will they be able to band together and defeat the Night king for good?

She was small and bony, skin burned from the sun, hair tangled like the weeds of the sea. She was confused, and scared, and hungry, and alone. Not even able to remember her own name.

When her emotions seeped through the cracks of her own hands, crashing into her chest and playing with her head. She remembers the first time she felt something. It was the first time she had sat with the girl named Arya Stark, a Lady of Winterfell in Westeros. A girl sat with Arya, playing the game. A game a girl was very good at. </p><p>\u201cWhat is a girl\u2019s name?\u201d A girl questions, voice even as they sat before each other on the floor of Arya Stark\u2019s own chambers. A girl held her staff in hand, a light grip as she waited. </p><p>\u201cA girl is No One.\u201d A girl\u2019s finger twitched, sensing the lie, but let it slide. A girl wondered how good of a liar Arya Stark would be, if given the chance to surpass her own name in this game. </p><p>\u201cWhere is a girl from?\u201d </p><p>\u201cA girl is from Winterfell; her father was a proud man. The blacksmith of Winterfell.\u201d Obviously, a lie. A girl struck Arya in the side, sending her the opposite way. \u201cA girl is the daughter of Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell.\u201d A girl struck her again, resulting in Arya\u2019s anger. \u201cThat\u2019s not a lie!\u201d </p><p>\u201cEddard Stark is dead.

Continue.\u201d </p><p>Arya rolls her shoulders, relaxing before continuing her story. As a girl listened, slapping the lies away with her staff, quietly accepting the truths; she felt something. A fondness, in her chest, grow for the Stark girl. Arya was small, but she was stubborn. A trait that was admirable to a girl. A girl relished in the fact she was able to be a positive figure to Arya. Arya asked her questions, and spoke to her, and asked her to teach her to fight. A girl found herself seeking the Stark\u2019s company on most occasions; working together, training, spending free time together. Once Arya was rendered blind, for disobeying, a girl found herself helping the poor Stark. She took food and water to her, quietly offering it, never speaking to her much. She watched from affair when the waif would come and strike her a few times before vanishing. A girl found herself offering to train Arya, getting her use to the darkness of her world. </p><p>Waif was cruel, crueler than what was necessary. A girl found herself hating the actions brought against Arya. It was strange, but she found she had a thick, yucky feeling in her throat whenever Arya was mistreated, and a heat under her skin when Waif smirked down at the girl with malicious intent. She never spoke of it, feeling it was something that would pass. It never did. And once Arya killed the Waif, and left, a girl went with her. </p><p>A girl arrived at the docks, wearing dark boots that matched her dark trousers, a deep red shirt with long puffed sleeves, a thick belt wrapped around her waist with dark leather arm bands around her forearms. A girl\u2019s thick hair was braided and out of the way, and her staff was held in her belt behind her. </p><p>\u201cArya Stark.\u201d The Stark whips around, sword at the ready.

A girl wants to follow Arya Stark.\u201d A girl stood tall, hands behind her back as she stated the words firmly. Arya\u2019s thick brows furrowed, confusion flooding her being before she puts her sword back inside its sheath, attaching it to her waist. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kill the queen.\u201d </p><p>\u201cA girl thought as much.\u201d </p><p>Arya narrowed her eyes, tilting her head. \u201cYou want to give up your faith? Be a person and not No One.\u201d </p><p>A girl looks down, biting the inside of her cheek. \u201cYes. A girl wishes to be herself.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need to stop talking like that, unless you want to give us away.\u201d Arya comments, leading them into the city. \u201cIs that your actual face?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d A girl answers simply, \u201cA girl has not seen her own face in many years.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHow many faces are you wearing?\u201d </p><p>\u201cJust this one.\u201d Arya nods, hand on the hilt of her sword as she strolled through the streets. </p><p>\u201cWhat is your real name? If you aren\u2019t a no one anymore.\u201d </p><p>\u201cA girl never had a name.\u201d Arya does not look convinced. \u201cA girl washed up on the beach as a child, and a man brought her into the House of Black and White. She has always been a No One. A girl never knew her name or her home.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDo you want a name?\u201d Arya asks, and a girl pauses, not sure of what to say. \u201cShow me your true face.\u201d A girl hesitates, before sliding the tips of her fingers under the skin and pulling the face away. Arya looked at her friend. A young woman stood before her, about a few inches taller than herself, with tanned skin and freckles scattered over her nose and cheeks. Her bottom lip was larger, but not in a strange way. Her brows were arched, and dark, matching the hair she had before. Her eyes were brown, almost black, and almond shaped. Her lashes long and fluttered as she blinked at Arya. Her button nose was cute, adding a young look to her friend\u2019s natural face. </p><p>\u201cYou look like an Y/n, can I call you Y/n?\u201d Arya questions and the girl thinks before nodding. </p><p>\u201cI am Y/n.\u201d Arya gives a smirk as her friend tries out her name. \u201cFriend of Arya Stark of Winterfell.\u201d </p>",

Spotting the familiar face, Arya relaxes just a little. </p><p>\u201cI am leaving.\u201d </p><p>\u201cA girl knows and understands.\u201d </p><p>Arya frowns. \u201cThen why are you here?\u201d </p><p>\u201cA girl\u2026wishes to leave as well. A girl wants to follow Arya Stark.\u201d A girl stood tall, hands behind her back as she stated the words firmly. Arya\u2019s thick brows furrowed, confusion flooding her being before she puts her sword back inside its sheath, attaching it to her waist. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kill the queen.\u201d </p><p>\u201cA girl thought as much.\u201d </p><p>Arya narrowed her eyes, tilting her head. \u201cYou want to give up your faith? Be a person and not No One.\u201d </p><p>A girl looks down, biting the inside of her cheek. \u201cYes. A girl wishes to be herself.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need to stop talking like that, unless you want to give us away.\u201d Arya comments, leading them into the city. \u201cIs that your actual face?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d A girl answers simply, \u201cA girl has not seen her own face in many years.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHow many faces are you wearing?\u201d </p><p>\u201cJust this one.\u201d Arya nods, hand on the hilt of her sword as she strolled through the streets. </p><p>\u201cWhat is your real name? If you aren\u2019t a no one anymore.\u201d </p><p>\u201cA girl never had a name.\u201d Arya does not look convinced. \u201cA girl washed up on the beach as a child, and a man brought her into the House of Black and White. She has always been a No One. A girl never knew her name or her home.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDo you want a name?\u201d Arya asks, and a girl pauses, not sure of what to say. \u201cShow me your true face.\u201d A girl hesitates, before sliding the tips of her fingers under the skin and pulling the face away. Arya looked at her friend. A young woman stood before her, about a few inches taller than herself, with tanned skin and freckles scattered over her nose and cheeks. Her bottom lip was larger, but not in a strange way. Her brows were arched, and dark, matching the hair she had before. Her eyes were brown, almost black, and almond shaped. Her lashes long and fluttered as she blinked at Arya. Her button nose was cute, adding a young look to her friend\u2019s natural face. </p><p>\u201cYou look like an Y/n, can I call you Y/n?\u201d Arya questions and the girl thinks before nodding. </p><p>\u201cI am Y/n.\u201d Arya gives a smirk as her friend tries out her name. \u201cFriend of Arya Stark of Winterfell.\u201d </p>",

It was easy to describe; all that was before now, was nothing. A girl remembers nothing before where she is now. A man found her on the shore of Braavos; young, barely seven name days into the world. She was small and bony, skin burned from the sun, hair tangled like the weeds of the sea. She was confused, and scared, and hungry, and alone. Not even able to remember her own name. A girl was childish, but no more is she those things. A girl is older, wiser, stronger. Perhaps not knowing who she was, made it easy for a girl to become No One. A girl has killed, all for and in the name of the Many-Faced God. </p><p>A girl cannot remember a time when her feelings gave way. When her emotions seeped through the cracks of her own hands, crashing into her chest and playing with her head. She remembers the first time she felt something. It was the first time she had sat with the girl named Arya Stark, a Lady of Winterfell in Westeros. A girl sat with Arya, playing the game. A game a girl was very good at. </p><p>&ldquo;What is a girl&rsquo;s name?&rdquo; A girl questions, voice even as they sat before each other on the floor of Arya Stark&rsquo;s own chambers. A girl held her staff in hand, a light grip as she waited. </p><p>&ldquo;A girl is No One.&rdquo; A girl&rsquo;s finger twitched, sensing the lie, but let it slide. A girl wondered how good of a liar Arya Stark would be, if given the chance to surpass her own name in this game. </p><p>&ldquo;Where is a girl from?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;A girl is from Winterfell; her father was a proud man. The blacksmith of Winterfell.&rdquo; Obviously, a lie. A girl struck Arya in the side, sending her the opposite way. &ldquo;A girl is the daughter of Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell.&rdquo; A girl struck her again, resulting in Arya&rsquo;s anger. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a lie!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Eddard Stark is dead. He is not Lord of Winterfell. He was.&rdquo; A girl explains, turning the staff in her hands as it lied in her lap. She tilts her head, &ldquo;What once was, does mean what is. Continue.&rdquo; </p><p>Arya rolls her shoulders, relaxing before continuing her story. As a girl listened, slapping the lies away with her staff, quietly accepting the truths; she felt something. A fondness, in her chest, grow for the Stark girl. Arya was small, but she was stubborn. A trait that was admirable to a girl. A girl relished in the fact she was able to be a positive figure to Arya. Arya asked her questions, and spoke to her, and asked her to teach her to fight. A girl found herself seeking the Stark&rsquo;s company on most occasions; working together, training, spending free time together. Once Arya was rendered blind, for disobeying, a girl found herself helping the poor Stark. She took food and water to her, quietly offering it, never speaking to her much. She watched from affair when the waif would come and strike her a few times before vanishing. A girl found herself offering to train Arya, getting her use to the darkness of her world. </p><p>Waif was cruel, crueler than what was necessary. A girl found herself hating the actions brought against Arya. It was strange, but she found she had a thick, yucky feeling in her throat whenever Arya was mistreated, and a heat under her skin when Waif smirked down at the girl with malicious intent. She never spoke of it, feeling it was something that would pass. It never did. And once Arya killed the Waif, and left, a girl went with her. </p><p>A girl arrived at the docks, wearing dark boots that matched her dark trousers, a deep red shirt with long puffed sleeves, a thick belt wrapped around her waist with dark leather arm bands around her forearms.
