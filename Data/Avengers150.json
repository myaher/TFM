I had <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVl_nC6kHcclNM7L1mDgTQw\">@buckysbeardliness</a> who requested a platonic pairing with Bucky, some fluff at a holiday party, and an AU where the avengers all work at a library. This is my first time doing a challenge of any sort and also my first time trying my hand at writing a reader insert piece so I hope you have as much fun reading it as I did writing it.\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cAlright Buck, I\u2019ll go.\u201d You said, setting your phone on the table. You reached over and put it on speaker before extricating yourself from your cover cocoon on the couch and stretching.</p><p>\u201cReally? You don\u2019t think it\u2019s too lame?\u201d He said his voice hesitant in that way he gets when he thinks you\u2019re being too good to be true. You marveled at how after all this time of being your best friend Bucky was still unwilling to believe that you genuinely wanted to spend time with him no matter what form that happened to take, even if that happened to be a holiday sweater party at his workplace. </p><p>You wondered for what must have been the hundredth time about what his life was like before you two met. You only knew the barest details and even that had taken years for him to open up about in small disjointed sections. You knew that besides yourself his only other close friend was Steve who he had known as a child and recently caught up with. Even Steve didn&rsquo;t know the full story of what happened while they were apart: He at least knew how Bucky lost his arm, what kinds of people he had gotten mixed up with, and how he ended up raising his kid sister Becca all on his own. You hadn\u2019t asked Steve or Bucky to tell you any of that. Bucky\u2019s life was his own to share with you when he felt ready. </p><p>\u201cBucky, you know me. If I wasn&rsquo;t coming with you to this party I would literally not move from my couch.\u201d You scooped up the phone heading for your closet to see it you could find a something that vaguely resembled a holiday sweater. </p><p>\u201cWell gee I\u2019d hate to disturb your plans\u201d This time you heard the slight smirk in his words that told you he had relaxed a bit.</p><p>\u201cOh no!\u201d You quipped, \u201cHow dare you pull me away from getting caught up on my latest YouTube videos and reading fan fiction to go hang out with all of your super sapiosexy librarian friends.\u201d That earned you one of Bucky\u2019s laughs which made you smile in triumph at the rare sound. Any time he laughed it was so earnest and real and you knew you were blessed to be one of the chosen few that got to hear it. </p><p>\u201cSeriously Buck. I do wanna go. It\u2019ll be nice to get to talk to your coworkers without having to whisper for once.\u201d You fished out a white sweater with blue snowflakes and decided it would have to do. It was not an ugly or holiday sweater but it was certainly wintery even if it wasn\u2019t overly festive and more importantly it was soft and comfy. You finished the look off with some knitted leggings, a blue scarf, and a pair of boots </p><p>You picked up your phone from where you flung it on the bed and told Bucky \u201cI\u2019ll get dressed now and swing by to pick you up on the way to the library.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThanks CJ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course Buck.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too nerd.\u201d With that you hung up and set about making yourself presentable for human contact. </p><p>***</p><p>When you and Bucky arrived at his place of work most of his coworkers and their plus ones were already there. The library wasn\u2019t that large, seven people in total worked there so when Steve had proposed they have a holiday party they agreed it best they all bring a plus one in order to have a sizable but still manageable group of people there. </p><p>The outside of the library was all done up with icicle lights. Indoors the usual bright fluorescents you had seen when you came by during the day were turned off and most of the light came from Christmas lights on the walls around the perimeter and reading lamps next to the various sofas and chairs giving the room a more intimate feel. Holiday music played softly to provide background noise and someone (probably Steve) had arranged the furniture to make a large half circle so that people could sit and mingle. He had even brought in some folding tables with food and drink on them. The head librarian Wong would never allow these items on the long wooden desks that were a permanent fixture of the library but they more than made up for the plastic tables with festive printed tablecloths. </p><p>Steve bounded up to greet you both looking like a golden retriever personified in his star spangled sweater that read &lsquo;Back to Back World War Champs.\u2019 He scooped both you and Bucky in for a brief but enthusiastic hug. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you guys could make it.\u201d He said pulling back so that he could look at the pair of you. \u201cCJ lovely as always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks Steve.\u201d you replied ducking your head self consciously. Usually taking compliments was hard but something about the way Steve said them made it easier. You didn\u2019t believe the man would ever tell a lie so when he gave compliments you tried to allow yourself to really feel them. </p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d He beamed, turning his attention on Bucky next. \u201cYou look good too Buck. Did Becca help you out?\u201d He gestured at Bucky\u2019s outfit. He had forsaken his all black ensemble for white washed jeans and a navy blue Isle of Misfit Toys sweater. He left his prosthetic at home and his left sleeve had been cut short and stitched up around his shoulder. His hair which typically would be in a low bun or just hanging loose around his face was in a half up style with a couple of small braids in it.</p><p>\u201cYeah she may have had something to do with it.\u201d Bucky grinned ducking his head as well and revealing his dimple with his shy smile. If there was anyone worse about receiving compliments than you it was Bucky, but he seemed able to take that one only because it was indirect praise for Becca\u2019s handiwork. </p><p>Steve turned releasing the two of you and facing the room at large. \u201cC\u2019mon let me introduce you to the whole gang.\u201d First stop was the couches where you met Sam, Nat, and Clint. </p><p>Sam was Steve\u2019s plus one. He worked as a social worker and had met Steve and Bucky years ago when he was helping Bucky get custody over Becca. Sam\u2019s sweater depicted a dabbing Rudolph and read \u2018Dabbing Through the Ho\u2019s.\u2019 At first you suspected one of the kids had put him up to it without fully explaining his meaning, but then again his knowing mischievous smile as you read it seemed to suggest otherwise. </p><p> Nat worked at the Library with Bucky and Steve she was immaculately dressed as always with a stylish dark sweater with gold and blue accents that her red hair looked striking against. Clint was Natasha\u2019s plus one and her \u2018Idiot best friend.\u2019 She introduced him good naturedly as such earning her a shove from Clint, some stifled chuckles, and fond smiles all around. When he stood up to greet you his hearing aids caught your eye and he explained them saying that he had been left mostly deaf from an accident a few years back. This made his burgundy and gold sweater which read \u2018The Bell Still Rings For Me.\u2019 more than a bit ironic which he also pointed out with a smile before anyone else could comment on it. \u00a0</p><p>From there Steve led you over towards the drinks and snacks where you spotted Wong the head librarian and Doctor Bruce Banner who in addition to working part time at the library with the others was currently working on a prospectus for his seventh doctorate. Wong\u2019s sweater had a picture of Beyonce wearing a Santa hat and script that read \u2018All the Jingle Ladies.\u2019 and Doctor Banner\u2019s was a deep green that had a modified periodic table on it and script that read \u2018O Chemistree O Chemistree.\u2019 </p><p>The two men were not saying much merely sharing sympathetic glances as the other two men who you assumed were their plus ones were engaged in a heated argument over longstanding holiday traditions and the commercialization of Christmas. </p><p>Interestingly enough the two men at first glance had looked kind of similar to you because they shared the same facial hair but upon closer inspections that was where the similarities ended. The shorter more solid of the two was wearing red tinted glasses that matched the writing on his sweater which had the period symbol for Holmium on it three times in order to spell out Ho Ho Ho. The taller more slight man with greying hair on his temples had on a long red open front cardigan rather than a traditional sweater like everyone else. Underneath that he had on a bright blue fitted shirt which read \u2018Happy Winter Solstice\u2019 across his chest in plain white script.</p><p>When Bruce and Wong finally managed to drag the two out of their heated argument long enough to introduce themselves to you, you found out that the shorter man was Tony Stark a mechanic and Bruce\u2019s ex boyfriend turned best friend. He made sure to kiss your hand and inform you that he was now very much single and played for both teams, at which point the taller of the two men rolled his eyes and cut Tony off to introduce himself as Doctor Stephen Strange Wong\u2019s roommate. When he shook your hand you could feel his gloved hands shake within your grasp but you politely chose not to comment on it. </p><p>After these introductions you grabbed some hot cocoa, Bucky managed to grab a coffee, and Steve grabbed a plate of cookies for the three of you to share. The three of you had just settled into a couple of armchairs when the last partygoers showed up. </p><p>First was Wanda who brought her twin brother Pietro along. She had on a scoop neck red sweater with a Star of David on it and Pietro had a blue and white sweater with a menorah on it and a bunch of tiny dreidels. Across his chest were the words \u2018It\u2019s Lit\u2019 </p><p>Behind the twins was Loki their long hair was braided up into two buns atop their head and their sweater was a striped green one you had been eyeing the other day in target. It was practically made for the tall slender librarian though especially because the image in the front was The Grinch and it had the words \u2018Never Naughty printed on it. Loki was scowling at the group at large as they entered but the twinkle in their eye and the sleight tug at their lips gave away the fact that they were secretly thrilled to be there. Beside them and ever their polar opposite was their brother Thor. His hair had been cut since you last saw him into a short asymmetrical buzz cut and his sweater was a red and silver glittery number that read \u2018On The Nice List\u2019 and that you were 99% sure absolutely no other human being on earth could pull off. </p><p>The newcomers greeted everyone and then beelined for the refreshments to fill their plates high with holiday treats. Once everyone had settled the semi circle made up of chairs and couches was full and conversations were in full swing. Everyone laughing and smiling and falling into sync with each other. Tony and Strange found something to argue about in every conversation topic that came up. As the night went on you all spoke about how everyone celebrated their respective holidays, and embarrassing stories were swapped. There was also unsurprisingly a lot of talk about books. You felt at home discussing everything from novels to scientific journals to poetry and back. \u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>After the party you drove Bucky back to his place and he persuaded you to come in and at least say hello to Becca. As soon as you came inside she was on you with a huge hug and an even bigger smile.</p><p>\u201cCJ!\u201d </p><p>\u201cHey kiddo just dropping off your big bro and then I\u2019m heading back to mine.\u201d</p><p>She pulled back but kept a hold of your hands. \u201cAw c\u2019mon CJ it\u2019s way too late.\u201d She dragged out the word way in the manner that only a 15 year old girl truly could.\u201dWhy don\u2019t you just spend the night here. We can watch Christmas movies and make a blanket fort.\u201d That actually sounded amazing so you looked to Bucky to confirm that it was okay with him. After a silent conversation over Becca\u2019s head he nodded and you knew that he probably had been expecting this all along when he invited you in. </p><p>You gathered all of the Barnes\u2019s blankets and pillows, Bucky went searching through their DVD\u2019s for anything Christmas related, and Becca popped some popcorn. In the end Becca fell asleep halfway through the third movie and you and Bucky left her in the pillow fort for the night. You offered to go home since the fort covered the couch but Bucky insisted you share the bed with him. It wasn\u2019t the first time since you had become friends and it certainly wouldn&rsquo;t be the last. He lent you an oversized pair of Pjs and you two settled in beneath the covers.</p><p>\u201cBuck?\u201d<br/></p><p>He hummed contentedly to show that he was listening, </p><p>\u201cI had a lot of fun tonight, with you and Becks and with the party.\u201d He rolled over to face you sensing that you had more you wanted to say. \u201cI think we know some cool people. They\u2019re all a little unique and a little weird I guess.\u201d You both chuckled.</p><p>\u201cKinda like the Isle of Misfit Toys, huh?\u201d Bucky rumbled.</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d You said grinning at your best friend in the dark.</p><p>You felt his arm circle you and pull you in. You wind your arms around his neck and you too lay there completely comfortable just hugging and enjoying each others presence.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad I found you guys.\u201d he breathed out, voice quiet because of your proximity and the tranquil mood.</p><p>You were glad he found you too. He was your best friend and he deserved to be surrounded by good people, you were all a bit strange and all a bit damaged but you made up his new world and that was what mattered.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas You nerd.\u201d Is what you finally said turning out of the hug so that he was spooning you. Neither of you scooted away. You just fell asleep wrapped up in each other and just before you drifted off you heard him say that he loves you too. </p><hr><p>Happy Holidays!!!\u00a0</p>",

His hair had been cut since you last saw him into a short asymmetrical buzz cut and his sweater was a red and silver glittery number that read \u2018On The Nice List\u2019 and that you were 99% sure absolutely no other human being on earth could pull off. </p><p>The newcomers greeted everyone and then beelined for the refreshments to fill their plates high with holiday treats. Once everyone had settled the semi circle made up of chairs and couches was full and conversations were in full swing. Everyone laughing and smiling and falling into sync with each other. Tony and Strange found something to argue about in every conversation topic that came up. As the night went on you all spoke about how everyone celebrated their respective holidays, and embarrassing stories were swapped. There was also unsurprisingly a lot of talk about books. You felt at home discussing everything from novels to scientific journals to poetry and back. \u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>After the party you drove Bucky back to his place and he persuaded you to come in and at least say hello to Becca. As soon as you came inside she was on you with a huge hug and an even bigger smile.</p><p>\u201cCJ!\u201d </p><p>\u201cHey kiddo just dropping off your big bro and then I\u2019m heading back to mine.\u201d</p><p>She pulled back but kept a hold of your hands. \u201cAw c\u2019mon CJ it\u2019s way too late.\u201d She dragged out the word way in the manner that only a 15 year old girl truly could.\u201dWhy don\u2019t you just spend the night here. We can watch Christmas movies and make a blanket fort.\u201d That actually sounded amazing so you looked to Bucky to confirm that it was okay with him. After a silent conversation over Becca\u2019s head he nodded and you knew that he probably had been expecting this all along when he invited you in. </p><p>You gathered all of the Barnes\u2019s blankets and pillows, Bucky went searching through their DVD\u2019s for anything Christmas related, and Becca popped some popcorn. In the end Becca fell asleep halfway through the third movie and you and Bucky left her in the pillow fort for the night. You offered to go home since the fort covered the couch but Bucky insisted you share the bed with him. It wasn\u2019t the first time since you had become friends and it certainly wouldn\u2019t be the last. He lent you an oversized pair of Pjs and you two settled in beneath the covers.</p><p>\u201cBuck?\u201d<br></p><p>He hummed contentedly to show that he was listening, </p><p>\u201cI had a lot of fun tonight, with you and Becks and with the party.\u201d He rolled over to face you sensing that you had more you wanted to say. \u201cI think we know some cool people. They\u2019re all a little unique and a little weird I guess.\u201d You both chuckled.</p><p>\u201cKinda like the Isle of Misfit Toys, huh?\u201d Bucky rumbled.</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d You said grinning at your best friend in the dark.</p><p>You felt his arm circle you and pull you in. You wind your arms around his neck and you too lay there completely comfortable just hugging and enjoying each others presence.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad I found you guys.\u201d he breathed out, voice quiet because of your proximity and the tranquil mood.</p><p>You were glad he found you too. He was your best friend and he deserved to be surrounded by good people, you were all a bit strange and all a bit damaged but you made up his new world and that was what mattered.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas You nerd.\u201d Is what you finally said turning out of the hug so that he was spooning you. Neither of you scooted away. You just fell asleep wrapped up in each other and just before you drifted off you heard him say that he loves you too. </p><hr><p>Happy Holidays!!!\u00a0</p>",

I had <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVl_nC6kHcclNM7L1mDgTQw\">@buckysbeardliness</a> who requested a platonic pairing with Bucky, some fluff at a holiday party, and an AU where the avengers all work at a library. This is my first time doing a challenge of any sort and also my first time trying my hand at writing a reader insert piece so I hope you have as much fun reading it as I did writing it.\u00a0</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cAlright Buck, I\u2019ll go.\u201d You said, setting your phone on the table. You reached over and put it on speaker before extricating yourself from your cover cocoon on the couch and stretching.</p><p>\u201cReally? You don\u2019t think it\u2019s too lame?\u201d He said his voice hesitant in that way he gets when he thinks you\u2019re being too good to be true. You marveled at how after all this time of being your best friend Bucky was still unwilling to believe that you genuinely wanted to spend time with him no matter what form that happened to take, even if that happened to be a holiday sweater party at his workplace. </p><p>You wondered for what must have been the hundredth time about what his life was like before you two met. You only knew the barest details and even that had taken years for him to open up about in small disjointed sections. You knew that besides yourself his only other close friend was Steve who he had known as a child and recently caught up with. Even Steve didn\u2019t know the full story of what happened while they were apart: He at least knew how Bucky lost his arm, what kinds of people he had gotten mixed up with, and how he ended up raising his kid sister Becca all on his own. You hadn\u2019t asked Steve or Bucky to tell you any of that. Bucky\u2019s life was his own to share with you when he felt ready. </p><p>\u201cBucky, you know me. If I wasn\u2019t coming with you to this party I would literally not move from my couch.\u201d You scooped up the phone heading for your closet to see it you could find a something that vaguely resembled a holiday sweater. </p><p>\u201cWell gee I\u2019d hate to disturb your plans\u201d This time you heard the slight smirk in his words that told you he had relaxed a bit.</p><p>\u201cOh no!\u201d You quipped, \u201cHow dare you pull me away from getting caught up on my latest YouTube videos and reading fan fiction to go hang out with all of your super sapiosexy librarian friends.\u201d That earned you one of Bucky\u2019s laughs which made you smile in triumph at the rare sound. Any time he laughed it was so earnest and real and you knew you were blessed to be one of the chosen few that got to hear it. </p><p>\u201cSeriously Buck. I do wanna go. It\u2019ll be nice to get to talk to your coworkers without having to whisper for once.\u201d You fished out a white sweater with blue snowflakes and decided it would have to do. It was not an ugly or holiday sweater but it was certainly wintery even if it wasn\u2019t overly festive and more importantly it was soft and comfy. You finished the look off with some knitted leggings, a blue scarf, and a pair of boots </p><p>You picked up your phone from where you flung it on the bed and told Bucky \u201cI\u2019ll get dressed now and swing by to pick you up on the way to the library.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThanks CJ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course Buck.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too nerd.\u201d With that you hung up and set about making yourself presentable for human contact. </p><p>***</p><p>When you and Bucky arrived at his place of work most of his coworkers and their plus ones were already there. The library wasn\u2019t that large, seven people in total worked there so when Steve had proposed they have a holiday party they agreed it best they all bring a plus one in order to have a sizable but still manageable group of people there. </p><p>The outside of the library was all done up with icicle lights. Indoors the usual bright fluorescents you had seen when you came by during the day were turned off and most of the light came from Christmas lights on the walls around the perimeter and reading lamps next to the various sofas and chairs giving the room a more intimate feel. Holiday music played softly to provide background noise and someone (probably Steve) had arranged the furniture to make a large half circle so that people could sit and mingle. He had even brought in some folding tables with food and drink on them. The head librarian Wong would never allow these items on the long wooden desks that were a permanent fixture of the library but they more than made up for the plastic tables with festive printed tablecloths. </p><p>Steve bounded up to greet you both looking like a golden retriever personified in his star spangled sweater that read \u2018Back to Back World War Champs.\u2019 He scooped both you and Bucky in for a brief but enthusiastic hug. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you guys could make it.\u201d He said pulling back so that he could look at the pair of you. \u201cCJ lovely as always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks Steve.\u201d you replied ducking your head self consciously. Usually taking compliments was hard but something about the way Steve said them made it easier. You didn\u2019t believe the man would ever tell a lie so when he gave compliments you tried to allow yourself to really feel them. </p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d He beamed, turning his attention on Bucky next. \u201cYou look good too Buck. Did Becca help you out?\u201d He gestured at Bucky\u2019s outfit. He had forsaken his all black ensemble for white washed jeans and a navy blue Isle of Misfit Toys sweater. He left his prosthetic at home and his left sleeve had been cut short and stitched up around his shoulder. His hair which typically would be in a low bun or just hanging loose around his face was in a half up style with a couple of small braids in it.</p><p>\u201cYeah she may have had something to do with it.\u201d Bucky grinned ducking his head as well and revealing his dimple with his shy smile. If there was anyone worse about receiving compliments than you it was Bucky, but he seemed able to take that one only because it was indirect praise for Becca\u2019s handiwork. </p><p>Steve turned releasing the two of you and facing the room at large. \u201cC\u2019mon let me introduce you to the whole gang.\u201d First stop was the couches where you met Sam, Nat, and Clint. </p><p>Sam was Steve\u2019s plus one. He worked as a social worker and had met Steve and Bucky years ago when he was helping Bucky get custody over Becca. Sam\u2019s sweater depicted a dabbing Rudolph and read \u2018Dabbing Through the Ho\u2019s.\u2019 At first you suspected one of the kids had put him up to it without fully explaining his meaning, but then again his knowing mischievous smile as you read it seemed to suggest otherwise. </p><p> Nat worked at the Library with Bucky and Steve she was immaculately dressed as always with a stylish dark sweater with gold and blue accents that her red hair looked striking against. Clint was Natasha\u2019s plus one and her \u2018Idiot best friend.\u2019 She introduced him good naturedly as such earning her a shove from Clint, some stifled chuckles, and fond smiles all around. When he stood up to greet you his hearing aids caught your eye and he explained them saying that he had been left mostly deaf from an accident a few years back. This made his burgundy and gold sweater which read \u2018The Bell Still Rings For Me.\u2019 more than a bit ironic which he also pointed out with a smile before anyone else could comment on it. \u00a0</p><p>From there Steve led you over towards the drinks and snacks where you spotted Wong the head librarian and Doctor Bruce Banner who in addition to working part time at the library with the others was currently working on a prospectus for his seventh doctorate. Wong\u2019s sweater had a picture of Beyonce wearing a Santa hat and script that read \u2018All the Jingle Ladies.\u2019 and Doctor Banner\u2019s was a deep green that had a modified periodic table on it and script that read \u2018O Chemistree O Chemistree.\u2019 </p><p>The two men were not saying much merely sharing sympathetic glances as the other two men who you assumed were their plus ones were engaged in a heated argument over longstanding holiday traditions and the commercialization of Christmas. </p><p>Interestingly enough the two men at first glance had looked kind of similar to you because they shared the same facial hair but upon closer inspections that was where the similarities ended. The shorter more solid of the two was wearing red tinted glasses that matched the writing on his sweater which had the period symbol for Holmium on it three times in order to spell out Ho Ho Ho. The taller more slight man with greying hair on his temples had on a long red open front cardigan rather than a traditional sweater like everyone else. Underneath that he had on a bright blue fitted shirt which read \u2018Happy Winter Solstice\u2019 across his chest in plain white script.</p><p>When Bruce and Wong finally managed to drag the two out of their heated argument long enough to introduce themselves to you, you found out that the shorter man was Tony Stark a mechanic and Bruce\u2019s ex boyfriend turned best friend. He made sure to kiss your hand and inform you that he was now very much single and played for both teams, at which point the taller of the two men rolled his eyes and cut Tony off to introduce himself as Doctor Stephen Strange Wong\u2019s roommate. When he shook your hand you could feel his gloved hands shake within your grasp but you politely chose not to comment on it. </p><p>After these introductions you grabbed some hot cocoa, Bucky managed to grab a coffee, and Steve grabbed a plate of cookies for the three of you to share. The three of you had just settled into a couple of armchairs when the last partygoers showed up. </p><p>First was Wanda who brought her twin brother Pietro along. She had on a scoop neck red sweater with a Star of David on it and Pietro had a blue and white sweater with a menorah on it and a bunch of tiny dreidels. Across his chest were the words \u2018It\u2019s Lit\u2019 </p><p>Behind the twins was Loki their long hair was braided up into two buns atop their head and their sweater was a striped green one you had been eyeing the other day in target. It was practically made for the tall slender librarian though especially because the image in the front was The Grinch and it had the words \u2018Never Naughty printed on it. Loki was scowling at the group at large as they entered but the twinkle in their eye and the sleight tug at their lips gave away the fact that they were secretly thrilled to be there. Beside them and ever their polar opposite was their brother Thor. His hair had been cut since you last saw him into a short asymmetrical buzz cut and his sweater was a red and silver glittery number that read \u2018On The Nice List\u2019 and that you were 99% sure absolutely no other human being on earth could pull off. </p><p>The newcomers greeted everyone and then beelined for the refreshments to fill their plates high with holiday treats. Once everyone had settled the semi circle made up of chairs and couches was full and conversations were in full swing. Everyone laughing and smiling and falling into sync with each other. Tony and Strange found something to argue about in every conversation topic that came up. As the night went on you all spoke about how everyone celebrated their respective holidays, and embarrassing stories were swapped. There was also unsurprisingly a lot of talk about books. You felt at home discussing everything from novels to scientific journals to poetry and back. \u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>After the party you drove Bucky back to his place and he persuaded you to come in and at least say hello to Becca. As soon as you came inside she was on you with a huge hug and an even bigger smile.</p><p>\u201cCJ!\u201d </p><p>\u201cHey kiddo just dropping off your big bro and then I\u2019m heading back to mine.\u201d</p><p>She pulled back but kept a hold of your hands. \u201cAw c\u2019mon CJ it\u2019s way too late.\u201d She dragged out the word way in the manner that only a 15 year old girl truly could.\u201dWhy don\u2019t you just spend the night here. We can watch Christmas movies and make a blanket fort.\u201d That actually sounded amazing so you looked to Bucky to confirm that it was okay with him. After a silent conversation over Becca\u2019s head he nodded and you knew that he probably had been expecting this all along when he invited you in. </p><p>You gathered all of the Barnes\u2019s blankets and pillows, Bucky went searching through their DVD\u2019s for anything Christmas related, and Becca popped some popcorn. In the end Becca fell asleep halfway through the third movie and you and Bucky left her in the pillow fort for the night. You offered to go home since the fort covered the couch but Bucky insisted you share the bed with him. It wasn\u2019t the first time since you had become friends and it certainly wouldn\u2019t be the last. He lent you an oversized pair of Pjs and you two settled in beneath the covers.</p><p>\u201cBuck?\u201d<br></p><p>He hummed contentedly to show that he was listening, </p><p>\u201cI had a lot of fun tonight, with you and Becks and with the party.\u201d He rolled over to face you sensing that you had more you wanted to say. \u201cI think we know some cool people.

Neither of you scooted away. You just fell asleep wrapped up in each other and just before you drifted off you heard him say that he loves you too. </p><hr><p>Happy Holidays!!!\u00a0</p>",

Wong&rsquo;s sweater had a picture of Beyonce wearing a Santa hat and script that read &lsquo;All the Jingle Ladies.&rsquo; and Doctor Banner&rsquo;s was a deep green that had a modified periodic table on it and script that read &lsquo;O Chemistree O Chemistree.&rsquo; </p><p>The two men were not saying much merely sharing sympathetic glances as the other two men who you assumed were their plus ones were engaged in a heated argument over longstanding holiday traditions and the commercialization of Christmas. </p><p>Interestingly enough the two men at first glance had looked kind of similar to you because they shared the same facial hair but upon closer inspections that was where the similarities ended. The shorter more solid of the two was wearing red tinted glasses that matched the writing on his sweater which had the period symbol for Holmium on it three times in order to spell out Ho Ho Ho. The taller more slight man with greying hair on his temples had on a long red open front cardigan rather than a traditional sweater like everyone else. Underneath that he had on a bright blue fitted shirt which read &lsquo;Happy Winter Solstice&rsquo; across his chest in plain white script.</p><p>When Bruce and Wong finally managed to drag the two out of their heated argument long enough to introduce themselves to you, you found out that the shorter man was Tony Stark a mechanic and Bruce&rsquo;s ex boyfriend turned best friend. He made sure to kiss your hand and inform you that he was now very much single and played for both teams, at which point the taller of the two men rolled his eyes and cut Tony off to introduce himself as Doctor Stephen Strange Wong&rsquo;s roommate. When he shook your hand you could feel his gloved hands shake within your grasp but you politely chose not to comment on it. </p><p>After these introductions you grabbed some hot cocoa, Bucky managed to grab a coffee, and Steve grabbed a plate of cookies for the three of you to share. The three of you had just settled into a couple of armchairs when the last partygoers showed up. </p><p>First was Wanda who brought her twin brother Pietro along. She had on a scoop neck red sweater with a Star of David on it and Pietro had a blue and white sweater with a menorah on it and a bunch of tiny dreidels. Across his chest were the words &lsquo;It&rsquo;s Lit&rsquo; </p><p>Behind the twins was Loki their long hair was braided up into two buns atop their head and their sweater was a striped green one you had been eyeing the other day in target. It was practically made for the tall slender librarian though especially because the image in the front was The Grinch and it had the words &lsquo;Never Naughty printed on it. Loki was scowling at the group at large as they entered but the twinkle in their eye and the sleight tug at their lips gave away the fact that they were secretly thrilled to be there. Beside them and ever their polar opposite was their brother Thor. His hair had been cut since you last saw him into a short asymmetrical buzz cut and his sweater was a red and silver glittery number that read &lsquo;On The Nice List&rsquo; and that you were 99% sure absolutely no other human being on earth could pull off. </p><p>The newcomers greeted everyone and then beelined for the refreshments to fill their plates high with holiday treats. Once everyone had settled the semi circle made up of chairs and couches was full and conversations were in full swing. Everyone laughing and smiling and falling into sync with each other. Tony and Strange found something to argue about in every conversation topic that came up. As the night went on you all spoke about how everyone celebrated their respective holidays, and embarrassing stories were swapped. There was also unsurprisingly a lot of talk about books. You felt at home discussing everything from novels to scientific journals to poetry and back. &nbsp;</p><p>***</p><p>After the party you drove Bucky back to his place and he persuaded you to come in and at least say hello to Becca. As soon as you came inside she was on you with a huge hug and an even bigger smile.</p><p>&ldquo;CJ!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Hey kiddo just dropping off your big bro and then I&rsquo;m heading back to mine.&rdquo;</p><p>She pulled back but kept a hold of your hands. &ldquo;Aw c&rsquo;mon CJ it&rsquo;s way too late.&rdquo; She dragged out the word way in the manner that only a 15 year old girl truly could.&rdquo;Why don&rsquo;t you just spend the night here. We can watch Christmas movies and make a blanket fort.&rdquo; That actually sounded amazing so you looked to Bucky to confirm that it was okay with him. After a silent conversation over Becca&rsquo;s head he nodded and you knew that he probably had been expecting this all along when he invited you in. </p><p>You gathered all of the Barnes&rsquo;s blankets and pillows, Bucky went searching through their DVD&rsquo;s for anything Christmas related, and Becca popped some popcorn. In the end Becca fell asleep halfway through the third movie and you and Bucky left her in the pillow fort for the night. You offered to go home since the fort covered the couch but Bucky insisted you share the bed with him. It wasn&rsquo;t the first time since you had become friends and it certainly wouldn&rsquo;t be the last. He lent you an oversized pair of Pjs and you two settled in beneath the covers.</p><p>&ldquo;Buck?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>He hummed contentedly to show that he was listening, </p><p>&ldquo;I had a lot of fun tonight, with you and Becks and with the party.&rdquo; He rolled over to face you sensing that you had more you wanted to say. &ldquo;I think we know some cool people. They&rsquo;re all a little unique and a little weird I guess.&rdquo; You both chuckled.</p><p>&ldquo;Kinda like the Isle of Misfit Toys, huh?&rdquo; Bucky rumbled.</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; You said grinning at your best friend in the dark.</p><p>You felt his arm circle you and pull you in. You wind your arms around his neck and you too lay there completely comfortable just hugging and enjoying each others presence.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I found you guys.&rdquo; he breathed out, voice quiet because of your proximity and the tranquil mood.</p><p>You were glad he found you too. He was your best friend and he deserved to be surrounded by good people, you were all a bit strange and all a bit damaged but you made up his new world and that was what mattered.</p><p>&ldquo;Merry Christmas You nerd.&rdquo; Is what you finally said turning out of the hug so that he was spooning you. Neither of you scooted away. You just fell asleep wrapped up in each other and just before you drifted off you heard him say that he loves you too. </p><hr /><p>Happy Holidays!!!&nbsp;</p>",

You had no idea where you were, just that there was a lot of branches and trees and bushes and you couldn\u2019t see a damn thing ahead of yourself. Not to mention, the mere presence of Loki was enough to drive you insane. You also weren\u2019t in the proper dressing at all, having to hike up to Asgardian dress you\u2019d been given and keep blowing the strands of curled hair into your face every five seconds. You were beyond peeved.</p><p>This was meant to be your night of glory. Thor, someone you\u2019d been good friends with since Loki\u2019s attack on New York, finally fulfilled his promise of bringing you to Asgard. It was the most wonderful thing you\u2019d ever seen. You felt fancier and prettier than you\u2019d ever felt in your entire life, dressed in the finest silk of Asgardian clothing. Given your line of work, it wasn\u2019t often you got to dress up and enjoy yourself. And it seemed, even this rarity had been ruined for you.</p><p>Then, there had been some sort of attack. From who, you had no idea. You\u2019d barely been able to see anything over the mass chaos that had ensued, and before you could even attempt to find Thor and figure out exactly what was happening, Loki had grabbed you and all but whisked you away.</p><p>Why? Well, you were still trying to figure that out.</p><p>\u201cYou ought to be less angry,\u201d Loki comments after a moment of tense silence.\u00a0\u201cNothing will come from you being mad at me.\u201d<br/></p><p>Halting to you a stop, you spin once more,\u00a0\u201cwhat do you expect me to do?

I\u2019m not even sure I want to know why, out of everyone, you chose the Avenger who ruined your ploy against New York.\u201d<br/></p><p>Loki\u2019s face tenses, and he raises his chin, glancing past your shoulder, obviously at a loss of words. You watch with narrowed eyes, crossing your arms over your chest. Your frustration only increases when his eyes widen ever so slightly, and his body tenses, as if he\u2019s seen something.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d You question, moving to turn your head.\u00a0\u201cWhat do you- Loki!\u201d<br/></p><p>He grabs you by the cheeks, turning your head back forwards.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat- Loki, what the hell are you doing!\u201d<br/></p><p>His eyes shift to yours then, still gripping your head, cupping your cheeks.\u00a0\u201cJust trust me.\u201d</p><p>\n\n<b> </b>\u201cYou are the God of Lies and Mischief, why should I trust you?\u201d The reader asked Loki.\n\n<br/></p><p>\u201cBecause if you don\u2019t,\u201d Loki starts, pointing behind you, whilst still keeping your head turned forwards.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ll die.\u201d<br/></p><p>You feel your heart spike in fear;\u00a0\u201cyou\u2019re not making any sense. What are-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re human,\u201d Loki states, causing you to furrow your brows.\u00a0\u201cThese things, they\u2019re behind us, heading towards us. If you look at them, you\u2019ll die.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cHow come you can?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cLike you said,\u201d Loki smirks, finally letting go of your head as he apparates a knife in his hand.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m the God of Lies and Mischief.\u201d<br/></p><p>Before you can say anything more, he runs past you. A part of you, a very strong part of you wants to turn around, help, something. But you remember his words, and you stay put, feeling more vulnerable then you\u2019ve ever felt before, unable to see the danger that lurks behind you.</p><p>All you hear is the sound of grunting, clashing knifes when is followed by a scream of pain. Then, there\u2019s silence.</p><p>Your skin tingles as you anticipate what\u2019s to come. You\u2019re not sure what you expect, and you clench your fists together in preparation. And then, a moment later, Loki appears before you.</p><p>Holding a hand against your chest, you let out a breath of fresh air.\u00a0\u201cLoki, what-\u201d</p><p>He interrupts you by pressing his lips against your own. It stuns you so much you can\u2019t move, your back straight as he molds his lips against your own. Your eyes remain wide open as his fall shut. And then, Loki\u2019s pulling back, smirking down at you.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s safe now.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWha-What? Loki,\u201d you stumble over your words, eyes wide.\u00a0\u201cWhat the hell was that? And did you&hellip; just kiss me?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cBeen wanting to do it for a while,\u201d Loki shrugs, stepping past you, and this time, you follow his movements.\u00a0\u201cNow, let\u2019s go.\u201d<br/></p><p>He walks off, and you stay there, frozen in your stop. You\u2019re still incredibly confused, and honestly, a little frightened. But the feeling of Loki\u2019s lips against your own&hellip; it hadn\u2019t been that half bad.</p><p>-</p><p><i>let me know what you thought? remember, <b>reblogging </b>always helps!</i></p><p><i>requests are <b>closed!</b></i></p>",
