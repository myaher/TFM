I\u2019d have loved to watch her play cupid with these two, shame it won\u2019t happen. hope you enjoy! :)</i></p><hr><p>-\u201dSandor,\u201d she calls after him, her mind newly cleansed of murder and revenge, seeing more clearly now than she had perhaps ever done. the man\u2019s name hangs in the air until he turns around, looking at her. she swallows and continues, shaking her head,\u00a0\u201cdon\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>-\u201dyou know I have to-\u201d</p><p>-\u201dno,\u201d Arya shakes her head firmer, more sure of herself now,\u00a0\u201cyou don\u2019t. neither of us do. Cersei and your brother will both be killed. it\u2019s not safe for either of us to be here anymore.\u201d</p><p>-\u201dthis is all I\u2019ve ever wanted, girl,\u201d his voice is not so much <i>harsh</i>, but he seems to have accepted what he says as the only truth in the world,\u00a0\u201cthis is what I\u2019ve waited my entire life for.\u201d</p><p>-\u201dbut what if there\u2019s something more? something else for us, somewhere else?\u201d</p><p>-there\u2019s a crash of a building falling outside, yet the city has never sounded so silent. Sandor clearly perks up at her suggestion, and his voice seems farther away as he asks,\u00a0\u201clike what?\u201d</p><p>-she swallows hard, popping her ears. she doesn\u2019t break his eye as she says the single word - the single name - that she knows holds most sway over him and his next option.</p><p>-\u201dSansa.\u201d</p><p>-his face all but melts, as he softens entirely at the mention of her sister. her pretty sister, as he had called her so long ago now, who still unintentionally had her claws in him. Arya had known, of course, before that moment and during. especially now, afterwards, watching how his forever-steeled expression broke as he thought of her.</p><p>-\u201ddon\u2019t be silly, girl,\u201d Sandor shook his head a little, convincing himself more than Arya,\u00a0\u201cshe\u2019d never want anything to do with a man like me. your sister likes pretty knights and gallant soldiers, not half-crisped old nearly-knights. I\u2019m better off ridding the world of Gregor.\u201d</p><p>-as she thinks he\u2019s about to leave - that that\u2019s going to be their final interaction, before he heads off into certain doom - she calls to him once more.\u00a0</p><p>-\u201dthen whose cloak does she keep in her quarters?\u201d</p><p>-all movements stop. he can only look on at her, mesmerised by her words, never having expected to hear them in his life, because Sansa wasn\u2019t the kind of woman that fell for him. tavern wenches liked him because he was big and looked mean, and if they could bed him it would be one for the diaries.\u00a0</p><p>-Sansa, however\u2026 Sansa was a lady.
