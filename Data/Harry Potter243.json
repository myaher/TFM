Professor Snape&rsquo;s problem is not that &ldquo;he needs to get laid&rdquo;.</p><p>322. Draco Malfoy is not a ferret animagus.</p><p>323.

Sneaking slugs into Ron&rsquo;s food is not funny. He does not like being reminded of his incident.</p><p>197. Trying to out-argue a Slytherin will lead to no good.</p><p>198. Despite popular belief, Hufflepuffs are not soft and squishy. Do not treat them as such.</p><p>199. I am not the wicked witch of the west.</p><p>200. -I will not refer to Professor Umbridge as such either.</p><p>201. I will not melt if water is poured over me.</p><p>202. -Neither will Professor Umbridge.</p><p>203. I do not have a Cyberman Patronus.</p><p>204. I am not a Wirn animagus, either.</p><p>205. I will not ask Aragog if he came from Metabelis III.</p><p>206. -Or if he has any pretty blue crystals.</p><p>207. &ldquo;Nessie is actually a cyborg created by the Zygons&rdquo; is not an appropriate thing to say in Care of Magical Creatures Class.</p><p>208. While it is appropriate to refer to Voldemort as &ldquo;Master&rdquo; while in his service, Voldemort and The Master are not one and the same.</p><p>209. I cannot substitute Prydonian robes for my Hogwarts uniform.</p><p>210. -Nor can my winter scarf be longer than standard issue.</p><p>211. I cannot attempt to recreate the Key to Time in Transfiguration class.</p><p>212. -Or transform a pepper pot into a Dalek.</p><p>213. Lucius Malfoy is not my &ldquo;sugar daddy&rdquo; and I will not claim he is.</p><p>214. -That goes double when Draco Malfoy is within earshot.</p><p>215. A time turner is not a flux capacitator, and I should therefore not install one in any Muggle cars.</p><p>216. &ldquo;To conquer the earth with an army of flying monkeys&rdquo; is not an appropriate career choice.</p><p>217. I will not levitate everywhere in a big pink bubble.</p><p>218. My professors have neither the time, nor the inclination to hear about what I did with six boxes of Sugar Quills.</p><p>219. No part of the school uniform is edible.</p><p>220. -Not allowed to make any part of the school uniform edible.</p><p>221. Not allowed to take house points from firsties for &ldquo;being too goddamned short&rdquo;.</p><p>222. Never, ever, attempt to correct Professor Moody about anything.</p><p>223. I must not refer to Headmaster Dumbledore as &ldquo;Mum&rdquo;.</p><p>224. -Nor Professor Snape.</p><p>225. Not allowed to use silencing charms on my Professors.</p><p>226. -Not allowed to use silencing charms my Prefects.</p><p>227. -Not allowed to use silencing charms, period.</p><p>228. Not allowed to prophesy the end of the world more than once.</p><p>229. Will not offer to sell Hagrid new creatures.</p><p>230. -Especially not if I actually have them.</p><p>231. Madame Hooch&rsquo;s name is just that, a name. Will not ask her to share.</p><p>232. -Also will not ask her to fly under the influence.</p><p>233. Will not try to recreate the Whomping Willow in herbology class.</p><p>234. Astronomy class will not cause me to be abducted by aliens.</p><p>235. Will not charm Hermione&rsquo;s time turner to rotate every half-hour.</p><p>236. If the thought of a spell makes me giggle for longer than 15 seconds, I am to assume that I am not allowed to do it.</p><p>237. I am not allowed to charm the words Ferret Boy onto Dracos forehead.</p><p>238. I will not sell tickets to get into the Chamber of Secrets.</p><p>239. Especially if it is only a one-way ticket.</p><p>240. Singing 99 Bottles of Potion on the wall non-stop repeatedly will result in a detention.</p><p>241. Playgirl and Playboy are not on the reading list for muggle studies.</p><p>242. Woad and other camoflage/body paints are not needed for DADA.</p><p>243. I may not challenge prefects to meet me on the Quidditch field, at dawn.</p><p>244. I shouldn&rsquo;t throw Fanged-Frisbees in the Great Hall.</p><p>245. I shouldn&rsquo;t use Photoshop to create incriminating photos of my house prefects or tutors.</p><p>246. I should not confess to crimes that took place before I was born, even if I have access to a time turner.</p><p>247. I should not show up at the front gate wearing part of another houses uniform, messily drunk.</p><p>248. -Even if my prefect did it.</p><p>249. I will not only wear &ldquo;Wizard hat, open robe &amp; tie&rdquo; and call it an authorized uniform.</p><p>250. Teaching exchange students to taunt other Hufflepuffs is not nice.</p><p>251. When detained by dementors, I do not have a right to a strip search.</p><p>252. Do not dare first years to eat bugs. They will always do it.</p><p>253. I will not refer to McGonagall as &ldquo;the cat-girl.</p><p>254. - Nor will I attempt to stop her transformation part way through.</p><p>255. - The same goes for Hermione.</p><p>256. I will not hand red shirts to the new DADA professor and claim that they&rsquo;re the standard uniform for the position.</p><p>257. I will not use invisibility charms on anyone&rsquo;s clothing.</p><p>258. I will not enchant the Golden Snitch to fly up the nearest fan&rsquo;s nose.</p><p>259. I do not know the Avada Kedavra curse, and pretending I do to people who annoy me is not funny, no matter how much they injure themselves diving for cover.</p><p>260. I will not test my Potions assigments by spiking Snape&rsquo;s drink with them.</p><p>261. - Especially not all of them at once.</p><p>262. I will not try to hock off my old piercing as &quot;priceless Muggle artifacts.&rdquo;</p><p>263. I will not claim my X-Files tapes are &ldquo;Auror Training Videos.</p><p>264. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if he is going on vacation; I will not comment about how the Minister of Magic is &quot;packing.</p><p>265. The Giant Squid is not to be referred to as &lsquo;my lord Cthulhu&rsquo;, nor am I allowed to sacrifice first years to it on the new moon.</p><p>266. I will not attempt to set up a mobile phone mast on the Astronomy Tower.</p><p>267. - Likewise the satellite dish.</p><p>268. The Slytherin Gift to Virgins is fictional, and I should not be asking Draco Malfoy or any of the other Slytherin boys if they&rsquo;ve mastered it yet.</p><p>269. The Muggles known as George W. Bush and Donald Trump are not related to or working for Lord Voldemort in any way and I am to stop insinuating that they are.</p><p>270. I will stop sending Professor Snape forged love notes that appear to be from Professor Lupin.</p><p>271. I will stop asking Professor Lupin exactly what goes on between him and Professor Snape when he brings him the Wolfsbane potion every month.</p><p>272. Luna Lovegood does not have pointed ears, nor is she to be addressed as 'Galadriel&rsquo;.</p><p>273. Lucius Malfoy also does not have pointed ears, nor is he to be addressed as 'Haldir&rsquo;.</p><p>274. Professor Snape definitely does not have pointed ears, and under no circumstances is he to be addressed as 'Spock&rsquo;.</p><p>275. I will stop substituting Professor Lupin&rsquo;s Wolfsbane with Polyjuice Potion containing hairs from Mrs. Norris.</p><p>276. I am not to stare at the Great Hall ceiling during dinner in the winter and cry 'My god, it&rsquo;s full of stars!&rsquo;</p><p>277. I am not to sing 'We&rsquo;re off to see the wizard, the wonderful wizard of Oz!&rsquo; when sent to the Headmaster&rsquo;s office&rsquo;.</p><p>278. - I am definitely not to sing it accompanied by the house elves acting as a backing group.</p><p>279. -Especially not with kazoos.</p><p>280. The research and manufacture of mind-altering substances will not gain me extra credit in Potions.</p><p>281. I am not able to see the Grim Reaper, nor am I to claim that he is standing by the Headmaster, tapping an hourglass and looking at him impatiently. Or, for that matter, Harry Potter.</p><p>282. When being interrogated by a member of staff, I am not to wave my hand and announce 'These are not the droids you are looking for&rsquo;.</p><p>283. Thestrals do not resemble the Muggle toys known as 'My Little Pony&rsquo;.</p><p>284. I am not to hold my wand in the air before casting spells and shout 'I&hellip; GOT&hellip; THE&hellip; POWER!&rsquo;</p><p>285. I am not a Vampire Slayer and Professor Lupin is not my Watcher.</p><p>286. -I am not to attempt to stake Professor Snape.</p><p>287. When Death Eaters are attacking Hogsmeade, I shall not point at the Dark Mark and shout 'To the Batmobile, Robin!&rsquo;</p><p>288. - Or 'Thunder, Thunder, Thunder, THUNDERCATS, HO!&rsquo;</p><p>289. Professor Flitwick is not to be referred to as the 'Dungeon Master&rsquo;.</p><p>290. I will not try to convert my housemates to Christianity.</p><p>291. -Or Wicca.</p><p>292. -This does not mean that my religious rights are being violated.</p>",

When detained by dementors, I do not have a right to a strip search.</p><p>252. Do not dare first years to eat bugs. They will always do it.</p><p>253. I will not refer to McGonagall as &ldquo;the cat-girl.</p><p>254. - Nor will I attempt to stop her transformation part way through.</p><p>255. - The same goes for Hermione.</p><p>256. I will not hand red shirts to the new DADA professor and claim that they&rsquo;re the standard uniform for the position.</p><p>257. I will not use invisibility charms on anyone&rsquo;s clothing.</p><p>258. I will not enchant the Golden Snitch to fly up the nearest fan&rsquo;s nose.</p><p>259. I do not know the Avada Kedavra curse, and pretending I do to people who annoy me is not funny, no matter how much they injure themselves diving for cover.</p><p>260. I will not test my Potions assigments by spiking Snape&rsquo;s drink with them.</p><p>261. - Especially not all of them at once.</p><p>262. I will not try to hock off my old piercing as \"priceless Muggle artifacts.&rdquo;</p><p>263. I will not claim my X-Files tapes are &ldquo;Auror Training Videos.</p><p>264. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if he is going on vacation; I will not comment about how the Minister of Magic is \"packing.</p><p>265. The Giant Squid is not to be referred to as &lsquo;my lord Cthulhu&rsquo;, nor am I allowed to sacrifice first years to it on the new moon.</p><p>266. I will not attempt to set up a mobile phone mast on the Astronomy Tower.</p><p>267. - Likewise the satellite dish.</p><p>268. The Slytherin Gift to Virgins is fictional, and I should not be asking Draco Malfoy or any of the other Slytherin boys if they&rsquo;ve mastered it yet.</p><p>269. The Muggles known as George W. Bush and Donald Trump are not related to or working for Lord Voldemort in any way and I am to stop insinuating that they are.</p><p>270. I will stop sending Professor Snape forged love notes that appear to be from Professor Lupin.</p><p>271. I will stop asking Professor Lupin exactly what goes on between him and Professor Snape when he brings him the Wolfsbane potion every month.</p><p>272. Luna Lovegood does not have pointed ears, nor is she to be addressed as 'Galadriel&rsquo;.</p><p>273. Lucius Malfoy also does not have pointed ears, nor is he to be addressed as 'Haldir&rsquo;.</p><p>274. Professor Snape definitely does not have pointed ears, and under no circumstances is he to be addressed as 'Spock&rsquo;.</p><p>275. I will stop substituting Professor Lupin&rsquo;s Wolfsbane with Polyjuice Potion containing hairs from Mrs. Norris.</p><p>276. I am not to stare at the Great Hall ceiling during dinner in the winter and cry 'My god, it&rsquo;s full of stars!&rsquo;</p><p>277. I am not to sing 'We&rsquo;re off to see the wizard, the wonderful wizard of Oz!&rsquo; when sent to the Headmaster&rsquo;s office&rsquo;.</p><p>278. - I am definitely not to sing it accompanied by the house elves acting as a backing group.</p><p>279. -Especially not with kazoos.</p><p>280. The research and manufacture of mind-altering substances will not gain me extra credit in Potions.</p><p>281. I am not able to see the Grim Reaper, nor am I to claim that he is standing by the Headmaster, tapping an hourglass and looking at him impatiently. Or, for that matter, Harry Potter.</p><p>282. When being interrogated by a member of staff, I am not to wave my hand and announce 'These are not the droids you are looking for&rsquo;.</p><p>283. Thestrals do not resemble the Muggle toys known as 'My Little Pony&rsquo;.</p><p>284. I am not to hold my wand in the air before casting spells and shout 'I&hellip; GOT&hellip; THE&hellip; POWER!&rsquo;</p><p>285. I am not a Vampire Slayer and Professor Lupin is not my Watcher.</p><p>286. -I am not to attempt to stake Professor Snape.</p><p>287. When Death Eaters are attacking Hogsmeade, I shall not point at the Dark Mark and shout 'To the Batmobile, Robin!&rsquo;</p><p>288. - Or 'Thunder, Thunder, Thunder, THUNDERCATS, HO!&rsquo;</p><p>289. Professor Flitwick is not to be referred to as the 'Dungeon Master&rsquo;.</p><p>290. I will not try to convert my housemates to Christianity.</p><p>291. -Or Wicca.</p><p>292. -This does not mean that my religious rights are being violated.</p></p>",

        "body": "<h1>522 Things I&rsquo;m not allowed to do at Hogwarts </h1><p>Numbers 97-194</p><p>97. I am not possessed by the ghost of Lady MacBeth.</p><p>98. -Neither is The Fat Lady.</p><p>99. When someone accuses me of not wearing any drawers, I should ignore them. Attempting to prove them wrong is indecent.</p><p>100. -Especially if I can&rsquo;t.</p><p>101. If someone&rsquo;s House Badge is green and mine is purple, it means they are in Slytherin House. It does not mean &ldquo;The Sorting Hat thinks they&rsquo;re dumber than me.&rdquo;</p><p>102. Using the Engorgio charm on certain parts of the human anatomy is not permitted on the school grounds, not even for entertainment purposes.</p><p>103. Professor Snape does not enjoy being called &ldquo;Snookums&rdquo;.</p><p>104. -Neither does he respond favourably to &ldquo;Sev&rdquo;, &ldquo;Snapey-Poo&rdquo; or &ldquo;Debbie&rdquo;.</p><p>105. First years are not to be fed to Fluffy.</p><p>106. Hagrid does not have relationships with magical creatures, and I should stop implying that he does.</p><p>107. I am not authorised to sell incriminating pictures of the faculty to students.</p><p>108. -Giving the same pictures out free of charge is also frowned upon.</p><p>109. Dumbledore is not Santa, he does not wish for me to sit on his knee and demand presents, especially not in June.</p><p>110. House Elf stew is not on the Hogwarts menu, neither is Niffler Curry, so I should stop asking.</p><p>111. A wand is for magic only; it is not for picking noses, playing snooker, or drumming on desks, no matter how bored I become.</p><p>112. It is inappropriate to slip sample bottles of Selsun Blue into Professor Snape&rsquo;s personal post-box.</p><p>113. I will stop referring to Hufflepuffs as &ldquo;cannon fodder.&rdquo;</p><p>114. I will not impersonate the Swedish Chef in Potions class.</p><p>115. I will not greet Professor McGonagall with &ldquo;What&rsquo;s new, pussycat?&rdquo;</p><p>116. My headmaster&rsquo;s name is Albus Dumbledore, not &ldquo;Gandalf.&rdquo;</p><p>117. Neville is not my valet.</p><p>118. When given a directive by my house prefect, I should not insist that &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t need no stinking badges.&rdquo;</p><p>119. First-years should not be encouraged to befriend the Whomping Willow.</p><p>120. I will not threaten the Fat Lady with Dip.</p><p>121. House ghosts do not regularly &ldquo;slime&rdquo; anyone.</p><p>122. Novelty or holiday-themed ties are not to be worn with my school uniform.</p><p>123. There is no &ldquo;open-mike night&rdquo; at Hogwarts.</p><p>124. I will not use my socks to make hand puppets of the Slytherin house mascot.</p><p>125. There is no bring a muggle to school day.</p><p>126. And I should stop insisting there is.</p><p>127. I should not ask Professor McGonagall if, while in cat form, she has ever coughed up a hairball.</p><p>128. I must not spread rumors that Lucius Malfoy is, was, or ever will be known in Death Eater circles as &ldquo;Dobby&rsquo;s Homeboys.&rdquo;</p><p>129. The fact that Draco Malfoy is short, blond, pale-eyed and rat-faced is no reason for me to tell the Slytherins that Peter Pettigrew should be paying Narcissa child support.</p><p>130. I will not say that Harry Potter&rsquo;s godfather has &ldquo;taken the veil.&rdquo;</p><p>131. When fighting Death Eaters in the annual June battle of Good v. Evil, I will not lift my wand skyward and shout, &ldquo;There can be only ONE!&rdquo;</p><p>132. I will not refer to any Death Eaters as &ldquo;Trixie.</p><p>133. -Even if it is a legitimate nickname.</p><p>134. I will not tell the Muggleborn first-years that the Forbidden Forest&rsquo;s real name is Mirkwood.</p><p>135. I must not start a &quot;Vetinari for Minister of Magic&rdquo; campaign.</p><p>136. I am not to conjure the words &ldquo;DRINK ME&rdquo; onto the vial of any potion in Snape&rsquo;s classroom.</p><p>137. I should not tell anyone that Dean Thomas&rsquo;s nickname is John.</p><p>138. I will not go to any fundamentalist websites and argue that Voldemort is a direct contradiction of the concept of &ldquo;intelligent design.</p><p>139. The next time that I see Rita Skeeter, I am not to threaten her with a can of Raid.</p><p>140. Should I chance to see a Death Eater wearing a white mask, I should not start singing anything from &quot;Phantom of the Opera.</p><p>141. I should not refer to DADA professors as &quot;canaries in the coal mine.</p><p>142. I will not say the phrase &quot;Dude, get a life.&rdquo; to Lord Voldemort.</p><p>143. I will not put books of muggle fairy tales in the history section of the library.</p><p>144. I will not send pictures of magical creatures to the Weekly World News.</p><p>145. I will not cover myself in ectoplasm and walk out of a fireplace, saying I took the &ldquo;Flu Network&rdquo;.</p><p>146. I will not refer to &ldquo;The Grim&rdquo; as a nice doggy.</p><p>147. I will not refer to Professor Lupin as a nice doggy.</p><p>148. I will not ask Professor Sprout where the Jolly Green Giant is.</p><p>149. I will not subvert the lock on the fourth-floor girls&rsquo; bathroom and sell its location to first-years as &ldquo;The Chamber of Secrets&rdquo;.</p><p>150. I am not permitted to utter the line: &ldquo;Hey, Rocky, watch me pull a out of my hat!&rdquo; during Charms class.</p><p>151. There is not now, nor has there ever been, a fifth House at Hogwarts, and I am not a member of that house, nor am I its founder.</p><p>152. When applying for a post at the Ministry of Magic after graduation, I should not cite &ldquo;Fred and George Weasley&rdquo; as my greatest influence at Hogwarts.</p><p>153. Putting down &ldquo;Lord Voldemort&rdquo; is probably not best either.</p><p>154. I am not allowed to ink my owl&rsquo;s feet, have it walk across a parchment, and sell the result as cheat sheets for Ancient Runes, even though Crabbe and Goyle keep falling for it.</p><p>155. I will not refer to the Accio charm as &ldquo;The Force&rdquo;.</p><p>156. I will no longer wear a hood, walk up to Harry, and claim to be his real mother.</p><p>157. I will not enchant the telescopes on the Astronomy Tower to display non-existent constellations during O.W.L. exams.</p><p>158. Albus Dumbledore&rsquo;s proper title is &ldquo;Headmaster&rdquo;, not &ldquo;My Liege&rdquo;.</p><p>159. A Muggle &ldquo;vacuum cleaner&rdquo; is not acceptable Quidditch equipment, even if it has been enchanted to fly.</p><p>160. Hogsmeade village is not &ldquo;a wretched hive of scum and villainy.</p><p>161. Sending rings to the nine senior faculty at Yuletide, with the return address &quot;Voldemort&rdquo;, is not funny.</p><p>162. Professor McGonagall does not have an inappropriate relationship with Mrs. Norris.</p><p>163.

                "content": "<p><h1>522 Things I&rsquo;m not allowed to do at Hogwarts </h1><p>Numbers 97-194</p><p>97. I am not possessed by the ghost of Lady MacBeth.</p><p>98. -Neither is The Fat Lady.</p><p>99. When someone accuses me of not wearing any drawers, I should ignore them. Attempting to prove them wrong is indecent.</p><p>100. -Especially if I can&rsquo;t.</p><p>101. If someone&rsquo;s House Badge is green and mine is purple, it means they are in Slytherin House. It does not mean &ldquo;The Sorting Hat thinks they&rsquo;re dumber than me.&rdquo;</p><p>102. Using the Engorgio charm on certain parts of the human anatomy is not permitted on the school grounds, not even for entertainment purposes.</p><p>103. Professor Snape does not enjoy being called &ldquo;Snookums&rdquo;.</p><p>104. -Neither does he respond favourably to &ldquo;Sev&rdquo;, &ldquo;Snapey-Poo&rdquo; or &ldquo;Debbie&rdquo;.</p><p>105. First years are not to be fed to Fluffy.</p><p>106. Hagrid does not have relationships with magical creatures, and I should stop implying that he does.</p><p>107. I am not authorised to sell incriminating pictures of the faculty to students.</p><p>108. -Giving the same pictures out free of charge is also frowned upon.</p><p>109. Dumbledore is not Santa, he does not wish for me to sit on his knee and demand presents, especially not in June.</p><p>110. House Elf stew is not on the Hogwarts menu, neither is Niffler Curry, so I should stop asking.</p><p>111. A wand is for magic only; it is not for picking noses, playing snooker, or drumming on desks, no matter how bored I become.</p><p>112. It is inappropriate to slip sample bottles of Selsun Blue into Professor Snape&rsquo;s personal post-box.</p><p>113. I will stop referring to Hufflepuffs as &ldquo;cannon fodder.&rdquo;</p><p>114.

There is no &ldquo;open-mike night&rdquo; at Hogwarts.</p><p>124. I will not use my socks to make hand puppets of the Slytherin house mascot.</p><p>125. There is no bring a muggle to school day.</p><p>126. And I should stop insisting there is.</p><p>127. I should not ask Professor McGonagall if, while in cat form, she has ever coughed up a hairball.</p><p>128. I must not spread rumors that Lucius Malfoy is, was, or ever will be known in Death Eater circles as &ldquo;Dobby&rsquo;s Homeboys.&rdquo;</p><p>129. The fact that Draco Malfoy is short, blond, pale-eyed and rat-faced is no reason for me to tell the Slytherins that Peter Pettigrew should be paying Narcissa child support.</p><p>130. I will not say that Harry Potter&rsquo;s godfather has &ldquo;taken the veil.&rdquo;</p><p>131. When fighting Death Eaters in the annual June battle of Good v. Evil, I will not lift my wand skyward and shout, &ldquo;There can be only ONE!&rdquo;</p><p>132. I will not refer to any Death Eaters as &ldquo;Trixie.</p><p>133. -Even if it is a legitimate nickname.</p><p>134.

I will not go to any fundamentalist websites and argue that Voldemort is a direct contradiction of the concept of &ldquo;intelligent design.</p><p>139. The next time that I see Rita Skeeter, I am not to threaten her with a can of Raid.</p><p>140. Should I chance to see a Death Eater wearing a white mask, I should not start singing anything from \"Phantom of the Opera.</p><p>141. I should not refer to DADA professors as \"canaries in the coal mine.</p><p>142. I will not say the phrase \"Dude, get a life.&rdquo; to Lord Voldemort.</p><p>143.

I will not refer to Professor Lupin as a nice doggy.</p><p>148. I will not ask Professor Sprout where the Jolly Green Giant is.</p><p>149. I will not subvert the lock on the fourth-floor girls&rsquo; bathroom and sell its location to first-years as &ldquo;The Chamber of Secrets&rdquo;.</p><p>150. I am not permitted to utter the line: &ldquo;Hey, Rocky, watch me pull a out of my hat!&rdquo; during Charms class.</p><p>151. There is not now, nor has there ever been, a fifth House at Hogwarts, and I am not a member of that house, nor am I its founder.</p><p>152. When applying for a post at the Ministry of Magic after graduation, I should not cite &ldquo;Fred and George Weasley&rdquo; as my greatest influence at Hogwarts.</p><p>153. Putting down &ldquo;Lord Voldemort&rdquo; is probably not best either.</p><p>154. I am not allowed to ink my owl&rsquo;s feet, have it walk across a parchment, and sell the result as cheat sheets for Ancient Runes, even though Crabbe and Goyle keep falling for it.</p><p>155. I will not refer to the Accio charm as &ldquo;The Force&rdquo;.</p><p>156. I will no longer wear a hood, walk up to Harry, and claim to be his real mother.</p><p>157. I will not enchant the telescopes on the Astronomy Tower to display non-existent constellations during O.W.L. exams.</p><p>158. Albus Dumbledore&rsquo;s proper title is &ldquo;Headmaster&rdquo;, not &ldquo;My Liege&rdquo;.</p><p>159. A Muggle &ldquo;vacuum cleaner&rdquo; is not acceptable Quidditch equipment, even if it has been enchanted to fly.</p><p>160. Hogsmeade village is not &ldquo;a wretched hive of scum and villainy.</p><p>161. Sending rings to the nine senior faculty at Yuletide, with the return address \"Voldemort&rdquo;, is not funny.</p><p>162. Professor McGonagall does not have an inappropriate relationship with Mrs. Norris.</p><p>163. I will not create a pin-up calendar of the Slytherin girls and call it &ldquo;Voldie&rsquo;s Angels&rdquo;.</p><p>164.

I will also not tell Professor Trelawney that I had a vision of her killing the Dark Lord.</p><p>168. I will not refer to Professor McGonagall as Catwoman, no matter how funny she would look in tight leather.</p><p>169. -Nor will I ask her if she is Catwoman in disguise.</p><p>170. I am not to ask if Lord Voldemort is secretly Hitler or Osama bin Laden.</p><p>171. I will not use Slytherin and Gryffindor first years as Christmas decorations.</p><p>172. I will not die the Death Eaters robes pink.</p><p>173. Humming/singing/referring in any way to Duran Duran&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hungry Like the Wolf&rdquo; around Professor Lupin is inappropriate. It&rsquo;s best not to bring up &ldquo;Thriller&rdquo;, either.</p><p>174. Insisting that the school acquire computers and network the buildings is a pointless request as they claim that a quill and parchment is sufficient.</p><p>175.
