        "body": "<p>Another small gift for <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjWddzkozpP6NlUE4EcN5qw\">@ceruleanstark</a></p><p>Arya Stark had been home for days now, or had it been weeks? Even here in the safety of the Winterland of her birth time was still escaping her. She aided Sansa in managing the people of the north. Sansa handled food, rations, workloads, and general instructions of how to prepare for what is coming. Arya spoke with the soldiers and the guards. She personally trained anyone who walks through the gate without ever having held a weapon before. A fact the Master of arms was growing more and more tiresome with. They were all supposed to be his students after all. His and the General of the Vale\u2019s army. What his name was, slips Arya\u2019s mind, but the man seemed completely loyal to her cousin. Even if he wasn\u2019t as on board with this stand, they were attempting to make.</p><p>Her favorite student was the only Lyanna Mormont. Named the same as the aunt Arya never got to meet. The one every adult who met Lyanna Stark saw inside Arya. If Lyanna Stark was a fighter then she couldn\u2019t have had anything on Arya\u2019s favorite student. She was quick to learn a lesson after her first slip of the hand. She met every strike of Arya\u2019s with the same steel in her eyes that Arya knew others saw in her.</p><p>One day Lyanna Mormont actually managed to land a hit o Arya. Something even the powerful Brienne had yet to do. The youngest ruler was better at the brute fighting style of Westeros, but she understood that when you go up to someone more powerful you have to dance around and tire them out. Although she rarely dodged she always matches her partners blow for blow. Repeatedly blocking their attacks with her sword was the way she wore them down. Not moving her sword much she always managed to get it in place at the right moment and save her energy doing so.</p><p>Arya was proud of the young ruler. If she survives the in-coming war then her people would be led well in the age that comes after. Even Sansa had to admit she was impressed by the Mormont. After hearing that on the island everyone was always training in preparation in case the Greyjoys ever attacked again only made it clearer that she was a born warrior.</p><p>\u201cArya Stark, as I live and breathe,\u201d Comes a call from under her. Arya peers down from the tree where she was now watching training sessions. Below was a man, tall, with long dark hair. His face was covered in scruff, and his hair was shaggy. For a moment Arya believes she is looking down at Jory again. But the man under the tree was too short to be Jory. Arya says nothing as her surprise subsides. She waits for him to say something more.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Ryon Forrester! Of house Forrester,\u201d He explains cupping his hands around his mouth. From the way, he spoke he clearly wasn\u2019t that old. Looking closer now, he wouldn\u2019t even have been Rickon\u2019s age. A year or two behind probably. Young to be growing any sort of hair. \u201cI\u2019ve come to join the fight!\u201d He adds twisting around to show a sword hanging off his waist. It was barely staying in place from the simple movement. This boy was greener than some of the southerners who had made their way up here.</p><p>\u201cYou should go find the Master of Swords!\u201d She calls back down, looking back towards the eastern sky. Thinking of her family in these moments before the next battle. It was one of the few times she could.</p><p>\u201cI want you to train me. Everyone says you are the best here! Even the youngest Mormont sings your praise. I\u2019m only a year younger than her. I can swing a sword too, please teach me?\u201d He pleads.</p><p>Arya\u2019s only thought was of the last time she saw Rickon\u2019s shaggy hair. He was two years younger then Rickon. A boy like that so eager to fight, with the look of a true Northman. He wouldn\u2019t survive this battle. She sends him away with the excuse that she had to give her lady sister extra lessons. Jumping down she easily lands on her feet. Telling the young noble to go find the Master of arms before she runs back to the castle. Passing a woman with dark hair, and scars decorating her face as Arya left the Godswood.</p><p>She stops for a moment to watch the woman. If she was with that boy, then perhaps he would survive. Deep down a feeling in her stomach tells her that he would only join the other ghosts that haunt this castle. Walking now, Arya dips her head. Putting all trust into her feet to know the way without her eyes. For the grey steel orbs were gone. Just like they had been with the faceless men. Only now clouds of memories cover them over instead of the cloudy grey and black nothingness that had then.</p><p>It was her sister who found her. Instead of running to their parents\u2019 old bedroom, Sansa had gone looking in the crypts. Finding her younger sister sitting still as a cat on Rickon\u2019s crypt. Arya heard her sister but did not move to look at her. She expected to hear a lecture. One where Sansa would use up all her long words just to say how it is wrong to sit on the dead. A lot of good those lectures had done her littlest brother.</p><p>Rickon was told so many times to stay away from the crypts. Now he was resting within them. Right below her feet was his heart. Of that, she had no doubt. Sansa made only the occasional comment of their little brother. How little he was compared to the coffin father had prepared for a grown man. His crypt was the last one in the little line of theirs. It was his heart that rested directly under her feet.</p><p>Sansa did not lecture her sister. She also did not join her on the crypt. Having far too much respect for the dead to ever consider resting on them. Arya didn\u2019t have that same sense of respect. She spent her first night back here resting the little bit she had on the cold feet of her father\u2019s statue. Somehow she still fit. Despite all the growing she had done.</p><p>Sansa rested a soft hand against Arya\u2019s head. Her slim fingers found their way through the brown hair their father had given her. Slowly as their mother once had, she moves her fingers back and forth across Arya\u2019s skull. It gave her little comfort and more memories than seeing the boy who looked like Jory had.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay to cry. I miss them too.\u201d Sansa\u2019s words were hollow. She was controlling herself. Keeping all of the information that should have been behind those words, locked up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not crying. Just tired,\u201d Arya huffs. Smacking her sister\u2019s hand away lightly she finally looks up.</p><p>\u201cWho knew assassins slept?\u201d Sansa says jokingly. A smug smile on her face.</p><p>\u201cEveryone sleeps. That is one of the best time to kill a man,\u201d Arya smiles threateningly in return.</p><p>\u201cAnother is in the bed of men, I imagine,\u201d Sansa\u2019s smile was gone now. Squeezing her lips back into a tight line. She closes her blue eyes. Even in this darkness, you could see the blue of her eyes. I darkness no one could see Arya. Not her brown hair, her small form, or her grey eyes. She could vanish, but Sansa was born to hold everyone\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cI miss them too,\u201d Sansa says, leaving their other conversation behind. Her sister looks sadly down at the crypt. \u201cWhen this war is over. We\u2019ll get him a statue. Like father\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe may all be dead by the time this war is over.\u201d Arya points out. The hole in her heart wouldn\u2019t let her even consider otherwise.</p><p>\u201cNot all of us.\u201d Sansa reaffirms, for once smiling like she use to with Jeyne as kids. The same smile she reserved for when she earned praise or was proud of her company. Arya missed that smile.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to commissioned the statue. I didn\u2019t get to see him before he died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon and I will make sure it looks like him. Better then father\u2019s.\u201d Lady Stark promises.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you join me for dinner?\u201d</p><p>Arya looks back down the dark tunnel. The only flame from the candles at the entrance. She could go back up, but something still asked her to stay. A deep feeling asking her to stay there with them. She may never see these crypts again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be up in a little bit.\u201d Arya promises.</p><p>Down in the tunnels underground she felt them. The ones who will never leave home again. Rickon now with them.</p>",

                "content": "<p>Another small gift for <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjWddzkozpP6NlUE4EcN5qw\">@ceruleanstark</a></p><p>Arya Stark had been home for days now, or had it been weeks? Even here in the safety of the Winterland of her birth time was still escaping her. She aided Sansa in managing the people of the north. Sansa handled food, rations, workloads, and general instructions of how to prepare for what is coming. Arya spoke with the soldiers and the guards. She personally trained anyone who walks through the gate without ever having held a weapon before. A fact the Master of arms was growing more and more tiresome with. They were all supposed to be his students after all. His and the General of the Vale&rsquo;s army. What his name was, slips Arya&rsquo;s mind, but the man seemed completely loyal to her cousin. Even if he wasn&rsquo;t as on board with this stand, they were attempting to make.</p><p>Her favorite student was the only Lyanna Mormont. Named the same as the aunt Arya never got to meet. The one every adult who met Lyanna Stark saw inside Arya. If Lyanna Stark was a fighter then she couldn&rsquo;t have had anything on Arya&rsquo;s favorite student. She was quick to learn a lesson after her first slip of the hand. She met every strike of Arya&rsquo;s with the same steel in her eyes that Arya knew others saw in her.</p><p>One day Lyanna Mormont actually managed to land a hit o Arya. Something even the powerful Brienne had yet to do. The youngest ruler was better at the brute fighting style of Westeros, but she understood that when you go up to someone more powerful you have to dance around and tire them out. Although she rarely dodged she always matches her partners blow for blow. Repeatedly blocking their attacks with her sword was the way she wore them down. Not moving her sword much she always managed to get it in place at the right moment and save her energy doing so.</p><p>Arya was proud of the young ruler. If she survives the in-coming war then her people would be led well in the age that comes after. Even Sansa had to admit she was impressed by the Mormont. After hearing that on the island everyone was always training in preparation in case the Greyjoys ever attacked again only made it clearer that she was a born warrior.</p><p>&ldquo;Arya Stark, as I live and breathe,&rdquo; Comes a call from under her. Arya peers down from the tree where she was now watching training sessions. Below was a man, tall, with long dark hair. His face was covered in scruff, and his hair was shaggy. For a moment Arya believes she is looking down at Jory again. But the man under the tree was too short to be Jory. Arya says nothing as her surprise subsides. She waits for him to say something more.</p><p>&ldquo;My name is Ryon Forrester! Of house Forrester,&rdquo; He explains cupping his hands around his mouth. From the way, he spoke he clearly wasn&rsquo;t that old. Looking closer now, he wouldn&rsquo;t even have been Rickon&rsquo;s age. A year or two behind probably. Young to be growing any sort of hair. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to join the fight!&rdquo; He adds twisting around to show a sword hanging off his waist. It was barely staying in place from the simple movement. This boy was greener than some of the southerners who had made their way up here.</p><p>&ldquo;You should go find the Master of Swords!&rdquo; She calls back down, looking back towards the eastern sky. Thinking of her family in these moments before the next battle. It was one of the few times she could.</p><p>&ldquo;I want you to train me. Everyone says you are the best here! Even the youngest Mormont sings your praise. I&rsquo;m only a year younger than her. I can swing a sword too, please teach me?&rdquo; He pleads.</p><p>Arya&rsquo;s only thought was of the last time she saw Rickon&rsquo;s shaggy hair. He was two years younger then Rickon. A boy like that so eager to fight, with the look of a true Northman. He wouldn&rsquo;t survive this battle. She sends him away with the excuse that she had to give her lady sister extra lessons. Jumping down she easily lands on her feet. Telling the young noble to go find the Master of arms before she runs back to the castle. Passing a woman with dark hair, and scars decorating her face as Arya left the Godswood.</p><p>She stops for a moment to watch the woman. If she was with that boy, then perhaps he would survive. Deep down a feeling in her stomach tells her that he would only join the other ghosts that haunt this castle. Walking now, Arya dips her head. Putting all trust into her feet to know the way without her eyes. For the grey steel orbs were gone. Just like they had been with the faceless men. Only now clouds of memories cover them over instead of the cloudy grey and black nothingness that had then.</p><p>It was her sister who found her. Instead of running to their parents&rsquo; old bedroom, Sansa had gone looking in the crypts. Finding her younger sister sitting still as a cat on Rickon&rsquo;s crypt. Arya heard her sister but did not move to look at her. She expected to hear a lecture. One where Sansa would use up all her long words just to say how it is wrong to sit on the dead. A lot of good those lectures had done her littlest brother.</p><p>Rickon was told so many times to stay away from the crypts. Now he was resting within them. Right below her feet was his heart. Of that, she had no doubt. Sansa made only the occasional comment of their little brother. How little he was compared to the coffin father had prepared for a grown man. His crypt was the last one in the little line of theirs. It was his heart that rested directly under her feet.</p><p>Sansa did not lecture her sister. She also did not join her on the crypt. Having far too much respect for the dead to ever consider resting on them. Arya didn&rsquo;t have that same sense of respect. She spent her first night back here resting the little bit she had on the cold feet of her father&rsquo;s statue. Somehow she still fit. Despite all the growing she had done.</p><p>Sansa rested a soft hand against Arya&rsquo;s head. Her slim fingers found their way through the brown hair their father had given her. Slowly as their mother once had, she moves her fingers back and forth across Arya&rsquo;s skull. It gave her little comfort and more memories than seeing the boy who looked like Jory had.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay to cry. I miss them too.&rdquo; Sansa&rsquo;s words were hollow. She was controlling herself. Keeping all of the information that should have been behind those words, locked up.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not crying. Just tired,&rdquo; Arya huffs. Smacking her sister&rsquo;s hand away lightly she finally looks up.</p><p>&ldquo;Who knew assassins slept?&rdquo; Sansa says jokingly. A smug smile on her face.</p><p>&ldquo;Everyone sleeps. That is one of the best time to kill a man,&rdquo; Arya smiles threateningly in return.</p><p>&ldquo;Another is in the bed of men, I imagine,&rdquo; Sansa&rsquo;s smile was gone now.

A match to help House Bolton hold the north. Arya Stark.&rdquo; - George RR Martin</p></blockquote><br /><p>&amp;D said Sansa&rsquo;s plot wasn&rsquo;t that interesting for TV. So they gave her Jeyne&rsquo;s Poole&rsquo;s arc to be raped and brutalised. A mess.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>After that GRRM decided to stop writing show scripts.</b> &#128064; But George looked very happy at this year&rsquo;s Emmy red carpet and gleeful mentioned that plot points he wrote over 20 years ago will be in S8. D&amp;D both said: the last season of GoT will swing back to George&rsquo;s original book endgame. At Brazil Comic Con on Thursday, D&amp;D answered Maisie&rsquo;s question about when they knew how everything would end? <b>They said they were already outlining Season 8 while they were producing Season 3!</b> Holy shit.

The reason she hasn\u2019t had much development in her relationship with Arya is because she hasn\u2019t been brought face to face with just how problematic that relationship was.</p><p>Sansa bullied Arya, but I highly doubt she understood it was bullying. Sansa partaking in (or at the very least not putting a stop to) calling Arya\u00a0\u201cHorseface\u201d isn\u2019t something she saw as harmful, though we the readers know it had lasting effects on Arya\u2019s self esteem. The same goes for all the other times she treated Arya as inferior for having less than feminine traits. Nothing has happened yet to force Sansa into making that connection.</p><p>But we know it will, because Sansa\u2019s treatment of Arya is a (much) smaller scale version of what Cersei does to Sansa.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\u201cYou\u2019re prettier with your mouth closed, Sansa,\u201d Cersei told her. <i>(Sansa III, ASOS)</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cJoffrey and his mother say I\u2019m stupid.\u201d <i>(Sansa IV, ACOK)</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cEveryone wants to be loved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see flowering hasn\u2019t made you any brighter,\u201d said Cersei. \u201cSansa, permit me to share a bit of womanly wisdom with you on this very special day. Love is poison. A sweet poison, yes, but it will kill you all the same.\u201d <i>(Sansa IV, ACOK)</i><br/></p></blockquote><p>Cersei makes jabs at Sansa\u2019s appearance, she insults her intelligence, and in the last quote she mocks her idealism. Her bullying is manipulative and intentional, and beyond that it\u2019s spiteful. Cersei is a grown woman, and a queen besides; she knows exactly what kind of effect her words have, and she says them anyway.</p><p>The thing is, Cersei\u2019s cruelty gives Sansa something to link her own flaws to. Sansa will be able to understand the humiliation Arya felt because she\u2019s felt it too; she\u2019s learned from Cersei what it feels like to be treated as lesser, and unlike Cersei, she\u2019ll be able to grow past it.\u00a0The dots are all in place, they just need to be connected.</p>",

People extrapolating from there that the North is all about Sansa and her becoming Queen in the North etc. are going to be in for a rude shock next season.

                "content": "<p>&ldquo;Martin has Roose Bolton tell his bastard son: &ldquo;We have a\n much better match in mind for you. A match to help House Bolton hold \nthe north. Arya Stark.&rdquo; - George RR Martin for the season 4 episode script, <i>The Lion and the Rose.</i></p><p>For all the folks going on and on about Sansa being the Key to the North etc. etc.? When GRRM wrote for the show, he still intended for Arya Stark to be the Key to the North. <br /></p><p>Once again, Replacing Jeyne with Sansa was D&amp;D&rsquo;s plan to give Sophie Turner something&nbsp; more to do and for Sansa to have a more important role on the show. That&rsquo;s why they cannot do much with Sansa in the North. <br /></p><p>For example, the Boltons call Sansa &lsquo;The Key to the North&rsquo; and yet everything that happens on the show, does not support this statement at all. Just look at the difference between fArya in the North in the books, and Sansa on the show. <br /></p><p>On the show, Jon hears nothing at all about Sansa till she reaches the wall and the pink letter is about Rickon</p><p>On the show Sansa runs away, and the Northern houses still support Ramsay without her. Meaning they are for house Bolton and not Stark.</p><p>Sansa asks for support from the Northern houses against Ramsay and no one gives it to her - no one wants to support the so called key to the North. They support Jon though.</p><p>It&rsquo;s LF who gets the Vale army to ride North after threatening to have Yohn Royce thrown out the Moon Door and who later convinces Glover and Royce to support Sansa instead of Jon.
