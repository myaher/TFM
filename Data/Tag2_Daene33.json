It\u2019s another story about using magic to upset the social order, and it\u2019s interesting to look at since, at least for me, the original movie provides one of the most recognizable pop culture examples of the evil chancellor who is motivated by naked ambition. It\u2019s also a trope rife with ableist and racist implications.<br/></p><p>What\u2019s sort of interesting about Tyrion is that he plays the role of the evil chancellor in different ways at various points in the narrative. In the asoiaf books he is a clear deconstruction of the role, and this is actually made explicit in A Clash of Kings, when he is labelled a \u201cdemon monkey\u201d and blamed for Joffrey and Cersei\u2019s crimes. His later motivation for joining Daenerys\u2019 revolution in the books is initially a desire for personal revenge, but it\u2019s also something that comes about because he himself has been booted by the system and blamed for other people\u2019s crimes because of his vulnerability as a disabled person, and his own family helps to let him take the fall for this because he\u2019s a convenient scapegoat. A revolution is what Tyrion needs to help him get back his birthright, and by the end of ADWD he is already starting to believe in Daenerys\u2019 cause despite himself.</p><p>In the show, Tyrion is motivated to aid Daenerys because he believes in her cause, because he believes that she can change the world for the better. He is explicitly told in season five that he himself cannot hope to rule because of who he is, but he can aid another in creating a world where people like him are not abused and used as scapegoats. He comes to believe in Daenerys not only for what it means to him personally but also because he genuinely believes that she can make things better for everyone. In the scene where Tyrion is made Daenerys\u2019 hand, he gives a speech about how she restored his belief in justice. It\u2019s interesting to note that the way this scene is filmed, Tyrion is standing a step above Daenerys so that the height difference between them is minimized. They are on equal footing, and Daenerys treats Tyrion as an equal where previously other characters saw him as lesser because of his disability. As Joffrey\u2019s hand, he is constantly belittled and undermined, and then disposed of when he is no longer useful to the Lannister regime. Here, Dany has purposefully made him her equal, and also defends his right to sit in her council when others attempt to belittle him.</p><p>A big problem on the show is that the writers did not really know what to do with Tyrion once he joined Daenerys, though, so he spent a long time treading water. As I said above, the show could not kill him, but they couldn\u2019t let the Tyrion from the books be portrayed onscreen, either. He had to be stripped of all of his ambition and made largely a passive actor, lest he be accused of the same thing the characters in A Clash of Kings accused him of. And indeed, he becomes the scapegoat for Daenerys when she needs someone to lash out at. When the narrative calls for it, he gives bad advice - because revolutions are not supposed to work out - and when the narrative calls for someone to give lip service about Dany\u2019s \u201cmadness,\u201d he becomes Exposition Guy, because he drinks and he knows things and he\u2019s there to give information but doesn\u2019t really have any personal interests anymore, he\u2019s just an advisor to everyone else. This was contradictory because the show ALSO seemed to be promoting the narrative that he wasn\u2019t as smart as he thought he was - which is a common narrative aimed at marginalized people that dare to be competent. The show also seemed to be characterizing him as someone who is\u00a0\u201ceasily offended,\u201d who\u00a0\u201ccan dish it but can\u2019t take it,\u201d also stereotypes about marginalized groups. Meanwhile the show has characters remark and point out how stagnant he is. In season 8 he spends a lot of time waffling between Varys, Jon Snow, Sansa, and Dany, but then when the show needs someone to do the dirty work and explain to Jon Snow the hero why he has to kill Daenerys, it\u2019s Tyrion who does that, because he can do all the manipulative and less savory stuff that our heroes can\u2019t do. As he tells Jaime, he can do this because is a \u201cbad person,\u201d and specifically invokes his dwarfism when he explains this. \u201cTens of thousands of innocent lives, one not-particularly-innocent dwarf. Seems like a fair trade.\u201d</p><p>And yeah, he\u2019s made hand to king Bran at the end, but he\u2019s also right back where he started. Tyrion\u2019s learned his lesson about trusting in revolutionaries, he\u2019s back in a role of servitude, and the social order has been maintained. He doesn\u2019t even get a mention in the \u201cSong of Ice and Fire\u201d because he doesn\u2019t get his own story, he\u2019s literally there to give advice to and serve others. The fact that he\u2019s technically lord of Casterly Rock and the Westerlands now doesn\u2019t even get a mention, just like he doesn\u2019t get a mention in the \u201cbook of the book.\u201d I guess he really does just drink and know things, after all, but what he should have known is that this story was never about him. I saw a lot of criticism of the finale along the lines of Tyrion talking too much, and he does, but hardly any of what he actually says is about himself, it\u2019s all about others and \u201cthe realm,\u201d and explaining the story to the audience so that the writers can make sure we draw the right conclusions. Book Tyrion is a character of deep longings and rage against the way things are, a perfect pair for Dany\u2019s revolutionary spirit.

But they did something worse to the character, imho, they neutered him.</p><p>If Daenerys is a revolutionary and a kind of well-intentioned extremist, Tyrion\u2019s character has always been a deconstruction of another villain trope that sort of goes hand in hand (no pun intended) with that archetype: that of <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor\">the evil advisor</a>.</p><p>I\u2019m thinking about this in part because I just went to see the new live action <i>Aladdin</i>, in which the villain, Jafar, frequently rants about how being second isn\u2019t enough for him, he has to rule everything. He even compares himself to the title hero, implying that he too started from nothing and worked his way up. It\u2019s another story about using magic to upset the social order, and it\u2019s interesting to look at since, at least for me, the original movie provides one of the most recognizable pop culture examples of the evil chancellor who is motivated by naked ambition. It\u2019s also a trope rife with ableist and racist implications.<br></p><p>What\u2019s sort of interesting about Tyrion is that he plays the role of the evil chancellor in different ways at various points in the narrative. In the asoiaf books he is a clear deconstruction of the role, and this is actually made explicit in A Clash of Kings, when he is labelled a \u201cdemon monkey\u201d and blamed for Joffrey and Cersei\u2019s crimes. His later motivation for joining Daenerys\u2019 revolution in the books is initially a desire for personal revenge, but it\u2019s also something that comes about because he himself has been booted by the system and blamed for other people\u2019s crimes because of his vulnerability as a disabled person, and his own family helps to let him take the fall for this because he\u2019s a convenient scapegoat. A revolution is what Tyrion needs to help him get back his birthright, and by the end of ADWD he is already starting to believe in Daenerys\u2019 cause despite himself.</p><p>In the show, Tyrion is motivated to aid Daenerys because he believes in her cause, because he believes that she can change the world for the better. He is explicitly told in season five that he himself cannot hope to rule because of who he is, but he can aid another in creating a world where people like him are not abused and used as scapegoats. He comes to believe in Daenerys not only for what it means to him personally but also because he genuinely believes that she can make things better for everyone. In the scene where Tyrion is made Daenerys\u2019 hand, he gives a speech about how she restored his belief in justice. It\u2019s interesting to note that the way this scene is filmed, Tyrion is standing a step above Daenerys so that the height difference between them is minimized. They are on equal footing, and Daenerys treats Tyrion as an equal where previously other characters saw him as lesser because of his disability. As Joffrey\u2019s hand, he is constantly belittled and undermined, and then disposed of when he is no longer useful to the Lannister regime. Here, Dany has purposefully made him her equal, and also defends his right to sit in her council when others attempt to belittle him.</p><p>A big problem on the show is that the writers did not really know what to do with Tyrion once he joined Daenerys, though, so he spent a long time treading water. As I said above, the show could not kill him, but they couldn\u2019t let the Tyrion from the books be portrayed onscreen, either. He had to be stripped of all of his ambition and made largely a passive actor, lest he be accused of the same thing the characters in A Clash of Kings accused him of. And indeed, he becomes the scapegoat for Daenerys when she needs someone to lash out at. When the narrative calls for it, he gives bad advice - because revolutions are not supposed to work out - and when the narrative calls for someone to give lip service about Dany\u2019s \u201cmadness,\u201d he becomes Exposition Guy, because he drinks and he knows things and he\u2019s there to give information but doesn\u2019t really have any personal interests anymore, he\u2019s just an advisor to everyone else. This was contradictory because the show ALSO seemed to be promoting the narrative that he wasn\u2019t as smart as he thought he was - which is a common narrative aimed at marginalized people that dare to be competent. The show also seemed to be characterizing him as someone who is\u00a0\u201ceasily offended,\u201d who\u00a0\u201ccan dish it but can\u2019t take it,\u201d also stereotypes about marginalized groups. Meanwhile the show has characters remark and point out how stagnant he is. In season 8 he spends a lot of time waffling between Varys, Jon Snow, Sansa, and Dany, but then when the show needs someone to do the dirty work and explain to Jon Snow the hero why he has to kill Daenerys, it\u2019s Tyrion who does that, because he can do all the manipulative and less savory stuff that our heroes can\u2019t do. As he tells Jaime, he can do this because is a \u201cbad person,\u201d and specifically invokes his dwarfism when he explains this. \u201cTens of thousands of innocent lives, one not-particularly-innocent dwarf. Seems like a fair trade.\u201d</p><p>And yeah, he\u2019s made hand to king Bran at the end, but he\u2019s also right back where he started. Tyrion\u2019s learned his lesson about trusting in revolutionaries, he\u2019s back in a role of servitude, and the social order has been maintained. He doesn\u2019t even get a mention in the \u201cSong of Ice and Fire\u201d because he doesn\u2019t get his own story, he\u2019s literally there to give advice to and serve others. The fact that he\u2019s technically lord of Casterly Rock and the Westerlands now doesn\u2019t even get a mention, just like he doesn\u2019t get a mention in the \u201cbook of the book.\u201d I guess he really does just drink and know things, after all, but what he should have known is that this story was never about him. I saw a lot of criticism of the finale along the lines of Tyrion talking too much, and he does, but hardly any of what he actually says is about himself, it\u2019s all about others and \u201cthe realm,\u201d and explaining the story to the audience so that the writers can make sure we draw the right conclusions. Book Tyrion is a character of deep longings and rage against the way things are, a perfect pair for Dany\u2019s revolutionary spirit. Show Tyrion doesn\u2019t even really seem to want things anymore, his appetites dulled. Dying for his own ideals would have been a better ending than having his edges gradually sanded off and whittled away until he\u2019s literally just a hand and a voice for whoever is in charge.<br></p>",

Maybe that&rsquo;s not what people would want for their favorite character but that&rsquo;s also kind of realistic like absolute power corrupts absolutely you know? And even with book!Dany who&rsquo;s definitely more sympathetic, those dragons are weapons of mass destruction.&nbsp;</p><p>But yeah, I personally wanted Dany to realize what she had done and feel genuine remorse rather than whatever the hell Emilia was doing during her death scene (something about reverting to a child???) but I didn&rsquo;t get that. I&rsquo;m not going to throw a fit and demand reshoots though lol.</p>",
