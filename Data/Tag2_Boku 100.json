        "body": "<p><b>Previously on BnHA:</b>\nDabi confronted Endeavor and Hawks following Endeavor\u2019s victory over\nthe High Brow Noumu. But then my girl Miruko the rabbit hero showed up, so Dabi\nfled the scene courtesy of some very familiar black ooze warping. We then cut\nto the League\u2019s mysterious hideout, where MOTHERFUCKING HAWKS was meeting up\nwith Dabi after the fact to complain that Dabi pulled some bullshit with their\nAGREED-UPON SECRET PLAN by attacking in the middle of a city with an\nexperimental Noumu. Dabi in turn accused Hawks of playing games because he failed to mention\nEndeavor would be involved, and he also managed to prevent even a single\ncasualty during the resulting chaos. So neither of them fully trust each other,\nbut in the end Dabi sent Hawks off and agreed to call on him again. We then\nlearned that Hawks is actually working undercover at the request of the police,\nwho need eyes and ears within the League to prevent another disaster like\nKamino. Hawks agreed to this knowing it would mean he\u2019d have to make some hard\ndecisions and turn a blind eye to some of the League\u2019s antics. It\u2019s implied he\u2019s\nfeeling guilty over what happened to Endeavor, so I have completed the adoption\npapers and had them notarized. Oh yeah, and speaking of guilt, for some reason\nDabi is standing out looking at the night sky and being weirdly sentimental. So\nyeah, I basically have no idea who is on whose side at this point, but I\u2019m\nfucking living for it you guys.</p><p><b>Today on BnHA:</b> The\nworld moves on from this latest incident of high profile villain destruction. Recovery\nGirl heals Endeavor and Hawks accompanies him to the train station while the\ntwo of them discuss the suspiciously coincidental appearance of the Noumu.\nHawks manages to dismiss Endeavor\u2019s suspicions, and Endeavor bids him farewell, but not before suggesting that Hawks should find\nsomebody to help him with his investigation. We get an extremely intriguing Hawks\nflashback and learn that he was groomed to be a\nhero from childhood due to his talent, but that he never wanted it and longs\nfor the day when society doesn\u2019t need heroes anymore. We then cut to the\nTodoroki house, where Endeavor greets his three Children With Known Whereabouts\nand has an unpleasant confrontation with Natsuo, who hasn\u2019t forgiven him despite his seeming change of heart and lets him know that in no uncertain terms. Shouto thoughtfully says that \u201cEndeavor the hero\u201d is\namazing, but as far as Endeavor the person goes, his feelings are in line with\nNatsuo\u2019s. However he wants to see what kind of dad he\u2019ll become from\nhere on out. Endeavor realizes that his new purpose is to secure a good future\nfor his children, and that the only thing he can do is continue to move\nforward. That night we cut to Deku, who finds himself in a strange dream with his body is covered in black\nsmoke. Shimura and the other OFA users are there as well. And then all of a\nsudden he\u2019s watching a scene from the past &ndash; All for One standing against his younger brother, the first OFA user.</p><p>This chapter is so fucking good and this recap is so fucking\nlong you guys lol. because it\u2019s just <i>so\ngood</i> ahhhhhhh.</p><p><br/></p><p>(As always, all comments not marked with an ETA are my unspoiled reactions from my first readthrough of this chapter.

But then my girl Miruko the rabbit hero showed up, so Dabi\nfled the scene courtesy of some very familiar black ooze warping. We then cut\nto the League\u2019s mysterious hideout, where MOTHERFUCKING HAWKS was meeting up\nwith Dabi after the fact to complain that Dabi pulled some bullshit with their\nAGREED-UPON SECRET PLAN by attacking in the middle of a city with an\nexperimental Noumu. Dabi in turn accused Hawks of playing games because he failed to mention\nEndeavor would be involved, and he also managed to prevent even a single\ncasualty during the resulting chaos. So neither of them fully trust each other,\nbut in the end Dabi sent Hawks off and agreed to call on him again. We then\nlearned that Hawks is actually working undercover at the request of the police,\nwho need eyes and ears within the League to prevent another disaster like\nKamino. Hawks agreed to this knowing it would mean he\u2019d have to make some hard\ndecisions and turn a blind eye to some of the League\u2019s antics. It\u2019s implied he\u2019s\nfeeling guilty over what happened to Endeavor, so I have completed the adoption\npapers and had them notarized. Oh yeah, and speaking of guilt, for some reason\nDabi is standing out looking at the night sky and being weirdly sentimental. So\nyeah, I basically have no idea who is on whose side at this point, but I\u2019m\nfucking living for it you guys.</p><p><b>Today on BnHA:</b> The\nworld moves on from this latest incident of high profile villain destruction. Recovery\nGirl heals Endeavor and Hawks accompanies him to the train station while the\ntwo of them discuss the suspiciously coincidental appearance of the Noumu.\nHawks manages to dismiss Endeavor\u2019s suspicions, and Endeavor bids him farewell, but not before suggesting that Hawks should find\nsomebody to help him with his investigation. We get an extremely intriguing Hawks\nflashback and learn that he was groomed to be a\nhero from childhood due to his talent, but that he never wanted it and longs\nfor the day when society doesn\u2019t need heroes anymore. We then cut to the\nTodoroki house, where Endeavor greets his three Children With Known Whereabouts\nand has an unpleasant confrontation with Natsuo, who hasn\u2019t forgiven him despite his seeming change of heart and lets him know that in no uncertain terms. Shouto thoughtfully says that \u201cEndeavor the hero\u201d is\namazing, but as far as Endeavor the person goes, his feelings are in line with\nNatsuo\u2019s. However he wants to see what kind of dad he\u2019ll become from\nhere on out. Endeavor realizes that his new purpose is to secure a good future\nfor his children, and that the only thing he can do is continue to move\nforward. That night we cut to Deku, who finds himself in a strange dream with his body is covered in black\nsmoke. Shimura and the other OFA users are there as well.

Natsuo may never forgive him, and\nhe\u2019s justified in hating him</li><li>but at the same time the only thing Endeavor <i>can</i> do is try anyway to be a better\nperson. he came to all of these realizations much too late, and the damage was\nalready done. but it\u2019s not too late to do whatever he can <i>now</i>. and he clearly is trying to do that</li><li>just, it\u2019s such a sad situation, and some really poignant\nwriting, honestly</li><li>anyway, Natsuo\u2019s just sarcastically screaming \u201coh, is that <i>so</i>?\u201d and then storming out and tossing a\nbelated apology over at his sister and thanking her for the food</li><li>wonder if he\u2019ll run into Aizawa on his way out. Aizawa will\nno doubt be in for another interesting conversation with Shouto on the way\nhome. <i>someone write this fucking fic</i>.\nif they haven\u2019t already. holy shit</li><li>now Fuyu is holding her head frustratedly and saying that\nshe was hoping that somehow they would finally able to become a proper family\nafter all this</li></ul><p><br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"879\" data-orig-height=\"549\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/389f80b75206319b9926cf9f2ed66605/tumblr_inline_poor1rUVZm1r1uxj5_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"879\" data-orig-height=\"549\"></figure><p><br></p><ul><li>hey. don\u2019t put this all on Shouto. he has even less reason\nto forgive Endeavor than Natsuo does. don\u2019t pressure him, let him sort\nout his own feelings goddammit</li><li>\u2026</li></ul><p><br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"530\" data-orig-height=\"312\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7d5ae48911e5ddc1b666ca9908848ab1/tumblr_inline_poor58nMLO1r1uxj5_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"530\" data-orig-height=\"312\"></figure><p><br></p><ul><li>Todoroki Shouto are you honestly a robot though</li><li>now the TV is suddenly cutting to the news and talking about\nEndeavor! what a fucking coincidence!</li><li>and it\u2019s showing all these people giving their opinions\nafter the most recent battle</li></ul><p><br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"574\" data-orig-height=\"407\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a328907c92b4f78a74add10d0c256e71/tumblr_inline_poor73P9fl1r1uxj5_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"574\" data-orig-height=\"407\"></figure><p><br></p><ul><li>the newscaster is all, \u201cas you can see, the voices of\nanxiety haven\u2019t changed\u201d</li><li>but! \u201con the other hand\u2026\u201d</li></ul><p><br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"860\" data-orig-height=\"267\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1f5a36e4d7337a7627ba68e447ef875e/tumblr_inline_poor7pROYR1r1uxj5_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"860\" data-orig-height=\"267\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"855\" data-orig-height=\"330\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/82d0112972cbf226cbeee6a34c3eb5bb/tumblr_inline_poor7dochG1r1uxj5_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"855\" data-orig-height=\"330\"></figure><p><br></p><ul><li>oh my god, Endeavor\u2019s awesome fan now has his own fans.

                "content": "<p><p><b>Previously on BnHA:</b>\nDabi confronted Endeavor and Hawks following Endeavor&rsquo;s victory over\nthe High Brow Noumu. But then my girl Miruko the rabbit hero showed up, so Dabi\nfled the scene courtesy of some very familiar black ooze warping. We then cut\nto the League&rsquo;s mysterious hideout, where MOTHERFUCKING HAWKS was meeting up\nwith Dabi after the fact to complain that Dabi pulled some bullshit with their\nAGREED-UPON SECRET PLAN by attacking in the middle of a city with an\nexperimental Noumu. Dabi in turn accused Hawks of playing games because he failed to mention\nEndeavor would be involved, and he also managed to prevent even a single\ncasualty during the resulting chaos. So neither of them fully trust each other,\nbut in the end Dabi sent Hawks off and agreed to call on him again. We then\nlearned that Hawks is actually working undercover at the request of the police,\nwho need eyes and ears within the League to prevent another disaster like\nKamino. Hawks agreed to this knowing it would mean he&rsquo;d have to make some hard\ndecisions and turn a blind eye to some of the League&rsquo;s antics. It&rsquo;s implied he&rsquo;s\nfeeling guilty over what happened to Endeavor, so I have completed the adoption\npapers and had them notarized. Oh yeah, and speaking of guilt, for some reason\nDabi is standing out looking at the night sky and being weirdly sentimental. So\nyeah, I basically have no idea who is on whose side at this point, but I&rsquo;m\nfucking living for it you guys.</p><p><b>Today on BnHA:</b> The\nworld moves on from this latest incident of high profile villain destruction. Recovery\nGirl heals Endeavor and Hawks accompanies him to the train station while the\ntwo of them discuss the suspiciously coincidental appearance of the Noumu.\nHawks manages to dismiss Endeavor&rsquo;s suspicions, and Endeavor bids him farewell, but not before suggesting that Hawks should find\nsomebody to help him with his investigation. We get an extremely intriguing Hawks\nflashback and learn that he was groomed to be a\nhero from childhood due to his talent, but that he never wanted it and longs\nfor the day when society doesn&rsquo;t need heroes anymore. We then cut to the\nTodoroki house, where Endeavor greets his three Children With Known Whereabouts\nand has an unpleasant confrontation with Natsuo, who hasn&rsquo;t forgiven him despite his seeming change of heart and lets him know that in no uncertain terms. Shouto thoughtfully says that &ldquo;Endeavor the hero&rdquo; is\namazing, but as far as Endeavor the person goes, his feelings are in line with\nNatsuo&rsquo;s. However he wants to see what kind of dad he&rsquo;ll become from\nhere on out. Endeavor realizes that his new purpose is to secure a good future\nfor his children, and that the only thing he can do is continue to move\nforward. That night we cut to Deku, who finds himself in a strange dream with his body is covered in black\nsmoke. Shimura and the other OFA users are there as well. And then all of a\nsudden he&rsquo;s watching a scene from the past &ndash; All for One standing against his younger brother, the first OFA user.</p><p>This chapter is so fucking good and this recap is so fucking\nlong you guys lol. because it&rsquo;s just <i>so\ngood</i> ahhhhhhh.</p><p><br /></p><p>(As always, all comments not marked with an ETA are my unspoiled reactions from my first readthrough of this chapter.

                "content_abstract": "<p>\n\n<p><b>Previously on BnHA:</b>\nDabi confronted Endeavor and Hawks following Endeavor&rsquo;s victory over\nthe High Brow Noumu. But then my girl Miruko the rabbit hero showed up, so Dabi\nfled the scene courtesy of some very familiar black ooze warping. We then cut\nto the League&rsquo;s mysterious hideout, where MOTHERFUCKING HAWKS was meeting up\nwith Dabi after the fact to complain that Dabi pulled some bullshit with their\nAGREED-UPON SECRET PLAN by attacking in the middle of a city with an\nexperimental Noumu. Dabi in turn accused Hawks of playing games because he failed to mention\nEndeavor would be involved, and he also managed to prevent even a single\ncasualty during the resulting chaos. So neither of them fully trust each other,\nbut in the end Dabi sent Hawks off and agreed to call on him again. We then\nlearned that Hawks is actually working undercover at the request of the police,\nwho need eyes and ears within the League to prevent another disaster like\nKamino. Hawks agreed to this knowing it would mean he&rsquo;d have to make some hard\ndecisions and turn a blind eye to some of the League&rsquo;s antics. It&rsquo;s implied he&rsquo;s\nfeeling guilty over what happened to Endeavor, so I have completed the adoption\npapers and had them notarized. Oh yeah, and speaking of guilt, for some reason\nDabi is standing out looking at the night sky and being weirdly sentimental. So\nyeah, I basically have no idea who is on whose side at this point, but I&rsquo;m\nfucking living for it you guys.</p>\n<p><b>Today on BnHA:</b> The\nworld moves on from this latest incident of high profile villain destruction. Recovery\nGirl heals Endeavor and Hawks accompanies him to the train station while the\ntwo of them discuss the suspiciously coincidental appearance of the Noumu.\nHawks manages to dismiss Endeavor&rsquo;s suspicions, and Endeavor bids him farewell, but not before suggesting that Hawks should find\nsomebody to help him with his investigation. We get an extremely intriguing Hawks\nflashback and learn that he was groomed to be a\nhero from childhood due to his talent, but that he never wanted it and longs\nfor the day when society doesn&rsquo;t need heroes anymore. We then cut to the\nTodoroki house, where Endeavor greets his three Children With Known Whereabouts\nand has an unpleasant confrontation with Natsuo, who hasn&rsquo;t forgiven him despite his seeming change of heart and lets him know that in no uncertain terms. Shouto thoughtfully says that &ldquo;Endeavor the hero&rdquo; is\namazing, but as far as Endeavor the person goes, his feelings are in line with\nNatsuo&rsquo;s. However he wants to see what kind of dad he&rsquo;ll become from\nhere on out. Endeavor realizes that his new purpose is to secure a good future\nfor his children, and that the only thing he can do is continue to move\nforward. That night we cut to Deku, who finds himself in a strange dream with his body is covered in black\nsmoke. Shimura and the other OFA users are there as well. And then all of a\nsudden he&rsquo;s watching a scene from the past &ndash; All for One standing against his younger brother, the first OFA user.</p>\n<p>This chapter is so fucking good and this recap is so fucking\nlong you guys lol. because it&rsquo;s just <i>so\ngood</i> ahhhhhhh.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>(As always, all comments not marked with an ETA are my unspoiled reactions from my first readthrough of this chapter. I&rsquo;ve read up through chapter 212 now, so any ETAs will reflect that.)</p>\n</p>",
