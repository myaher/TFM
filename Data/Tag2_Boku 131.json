He didn\u2019t think such beauty existed until he saw you for the first time and he made it his mission to get to know you since that day. A couple of months later and the two of you grew closer to where your relationship were teetering on the edge of friendship and lovers. Everyone around you assumed you were dating already, even your parents often called Kaminari your boyfriend whenever you told them you were going to meet up with him. There were times when he would hold your hand while he walked you home, and silence would be a welcoming friend between you two. The two of you would avoid each other\u2019s gaze and feel the heat of your clasped hands, the roughness of his palms from training, and the pleasant shock of his touch whenever his hand would lightly squeeze yours. It was only a matter of time before Kaminari would finally get the guts to confess his love for you.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Denki\u2026\u201d You blushed and took the large stuffed Pikachu plushie from his hands and held it to your chest. He had just gone through an excruciatingly long battle with the crane machine, spending almost all of his money to win you a plushie. He knew how much of a scam most of these machines were, but he couldn\u2019t ignore that glimmer in your eyes when you saw them. You tried to convince him to quit when he lost a couple of times but with one dazzling smile of his had you believing in him.</p><p>\u201cSee? Told you I\u2019ll win it for you!\u201d He grinned a grin so confident, it had you chuckling. The sound was music to his ears.</p><p>\u201cI love it so much!\u201d You squeezed the plushie in your arms and Kaminari wished he was in its place, in between your arms and against your body. \u201cReally, Denki\u2026 Seriously, thank you.\u201d Lightning struck through his heart at the sight of your lovely smile, it rocked at his soul and his cheeks flared up in red. His hands grew clammy as he couldn\u2019t lift his gaze from the brightness of your eyes. Certainly, to Kaminari, you were the most beautiful person he ever saw.</p><p>His lips were sudden, pressed against yours in an act of his urges. His clammy hands were latched onto your arms and pressed into your skin. It was like static had surged from the connection and burrowed down within your body and froze you. You didn\u2019t relax in his hold at all even when he pulled away, visibly in panic about his actions.</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2026 didn\u2019t\u2026 I\u2014\u201d But you silenced him with a kiss of your own when you had recovered from your shock, sending Kaminari into his own spell of disbelief.</p>",

A couple of months later and the two of you grew closer to where your relationship were teetering on the edge of friendship and lovers. Everyone around you assumed you were dating already, even your parents often called Kaminari your boyfriend whenever you told them you were going to meet up with him. There were times when he would hold your hand while he walked you home, and silence would be a welcoming friend between you two. The two of you would avoid each other\u2019s gaze and feel the heat of your clasped hands, the roughness of his palms from training, and the pleasant shock of his touch whenever his hand would lightly squeeze yours.
