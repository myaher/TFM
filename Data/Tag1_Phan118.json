I think he was just in a bad place with his mental health and was trying to balance a whole new radio career, moving to a completely different city, and having his fanbase jump up to 1m subs (who then got way too into his business and forced him to go on the defensive). Early 20s are hard. I wasn\u2019t always the most pleasant person then either, and I wasn\u2019t famous at all. People just like to throw him under the bus when he calls them out.",
        "answer": "<p>Oh, I could not agree with this more and would even take it a bit further: I don\u2019t think 2012 had anything to do with mental health (not that you are doing this, but I have heard people use this to try to discredit him a lot). I think Dan reacted really pretty well under the circumstances. Sure he could have handled everything better, but musicians and actors have teams of people helping them to manage these things and early YouTubers didn\u2019t have any of that. What kind of sainthood do people realistically expect from a 21 year old who (in addition to the things you mentioned) was not only being stalked and harassed himself, but was also the reason his friends and family were being stalked and harassed, who was being objectified, violated, and fetishized, and who was getting incredible amounts of backlash for trying to live his truth, which unfortunately wasn\u2019t the same as the truth certain \u201cfans\u201d wanted for him. I\u2019m all for YouTubers and celebrities being nice to their fans, but these fans didn\u2019t deserve anything and they got much more polite responses from him than they would have from a lot of people. He was trying to have a dialogue with people and give them the benefit of the doubt, assuming they would behave reasonably, and they behaved like spoiled children throwing a tantrum because their toys got taken away. Some people are still throwing tantrums over this when they even hear the word 2012. It truly makes my blood boil. I will never understand how people can look at the behavior from others (and maybe even themselves) at the time, look at Dan\u2019s reactions to that, and then come to the conclusion that he was the main problem. </p>",
