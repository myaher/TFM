The children\nhad reached out and hid Bran and Theon from the White Walkers. The enemy would\nnot sense them, not as long as there was a feast of living souls they could expect\nto drain as soon as they had won the castle. </p><p>Bran let\nhis mind wander, seeing, but not acting.

Bran\ndoubted he could hide anything from them if he opened his thoughts again to the\nweirwood. He had not even dared to take the arrows from the tree. The children\nhad reached out and hid Bran and Theon from the White Walkers. The enemy would\nnot sense them, not as long as there was a feast of living souls they could expect\nto drain as soon as they had won the castle. </p><p>Bran let\nhis mind wander, seeing, but not acting. The time for action would come later, for\nnow the pieces were all set. He wondered if his siblings would think him cold.\nA part of him knew that they would not appreciate to be moved like pieces on a\ncyvasse board, but that was as far as his understanding went. He knew that they\nprobably would be angry with him, but he did not feel it, nor did he dread\ntheir hurt.</p><p><b><i>Brienne and Jaime were\nfighting in a steady and constant rhythm, as if they were one person, sensing\nthe other\u2019s weakness, raising their swords to help the other. </i></b></p><p><b><i>Arya was a small\nwhirlwind.

I don\u2019t claim to understand everything, but I do\nthink there is a flaw in your argument. You say it is all about balance, but if\nwe can restore balance by destroying the White Walkers with wildfire and then killing\nthe dragons, why can\u2019t we do it, the other way round? Kill the dragons and then\nthe fire magic is gone, and then White Walkers will die as well.\u201d</p><p>Bran shook\nhis head. <i>We could have done that, if\nDaenerys had let us. But she would not give up her dragons.</i> He would have\nto come up with something that would appease Theon and the voices in his head.</p><p>\u201cIf the\nWhite Walkers are killed first, the Children regain their strength and only\nthen the arrows will be strong enough to kill the dragons. It is crucial that\nthe scales first tip in favour of fire. It is the ice magic that channels the\nstrength away from the Children.\u201d</p><p>The voices\nin his head were satisfied. Bran could feel their pressure in his head lessen\nfor a moment, and he heard something that felt like the far away echo of a\nchuckle. Quickly, he distracted himself from the sound.

I just have to check on Jon.\u201d</p><p>Before he\nconcentrated on the battle again, he saw worry cast a shadow on Theon\u2019s face.\nHe knew he probably looked creepy when he delved into his visions, but that was\nnot to be helped.</p><p>Bran\nchecked on Rhaegal. It was interesting how the wall of earth magic he and Jon\nhad built around his mind had changed the dragon. His contained fire was less\ndangerous, more focussed than Drogon\u2019s, but it was still fire. <i>Fire made flesh.</i> Bran briefly touched\nJon\u2019s mind reassuringly. He wondered if he should have told his cousin to not\ngrow too attached to the beast.</p><p><b><i>Sansa was leading the everybody\ndown into the crypts.
