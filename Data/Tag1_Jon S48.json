            "description": "Hi there! My name is Ellie! Welcome to my tumblr! \u00a0Just thought I'd add a few things to know about me and my blog! If my url gives you any clues, at the heart of this tumblr, I'm a proud Harmony shipper through and through. And while I do still reblog HHR and Dan and Emma content (and I always will) you will find that the majority of my focus has shifted to Jonerys (Jon x Daenerys from Game of Thrones).\u00a0And while you might have to do a little deep blogging to find my reblogs on these, I also ship--both passionately and casually--Cesare x Lucrezia, Mulder x Scully, Lizzington for a while until tptb started to mess with it, Baker x Lawson (Bawson), all the Sense8 ships though Kalagang is my #1, Clint x Natasha (Clintasha), Jane x Thor (Fosterson), Darcy x Loki (Tasertricks), Darcy x Steve (Shieldshock), Kili x Tauriel (Kiliel), Superman x Wonder Woman (Superwonder), and more than I have space for or the memory to list. \nI do my best to tag every post so that if something is your notp, it's nsfw, or it's triggering, you can blacklist it. That said, if you follow me and there is something that you need tagged in order to make it a happy place for you to explore, come into my inbox and let me know :) You will also see a lot of politically charged reblogs in support of women, the queer/gender-queer and trans community, BLM, Muslims, POC, Jewish people, the mentally ill, and austistic people. I'm strongly pro choice, pro inter-sectional feminism, and refuse to call the angry cheeto currently living in the white house president. If anything like that offends you, this might not be the right blog for you.\nLast little few things to throw out there: I'm 35, I plan to adopt at least 4 cats (or more) at some point and be that cat lady everyone's always whispering about, and I tend to greet and converse with everyone I meet like an overeager puppy. \nWhew! Sorry for the long intro folks! Please enjoy your time here, and remember, you're always welcome to come in and say hi!",

No longer was she able to live as though she did so without a care in the world. No longer did she live, never looking over her shoulder or jumping at the slightest noise that filled her ears.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we\u2019ve taken a wrong turning.\u201d Y/N softly spoke, sighing as she took a look around her and tried to force herself to recognise anything around her. \u201cOr perhaps we were never going in the correct direction&hellip;\u201d\u00a0</p><p>She breathed deeply, pushing a few strands of hair from her face and tucking it behind her ear, looking towards the sky. Her companion merely looked around for a threat of any kind.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She muttered, twisting as she finally turned to face what she knew was the general direction. \u201cNorth is North. We go North until we cannot go North anymore.\u201d</p><p>Her companion looked up at her, his head tilting slightly as though asking if she was serious or not. Y/N raised a brow.</p><p>\u201cDo not look at me like that, Grey Wind.\u201d She scolded the Direwolf, setting off in the direction she had deemed worthy. \u201cFather always taught me to think quickly and not to ponder on the idea too much. After all&hellip; Ours is the fury.\u201d</p><p>With that said, Y/N set off once more, her companion and saviour, Grey Wind at her side. \u00a0<br/><br/><i><b>Then</b></i><br/><br/>&ldquo;My Father says that it is impossible for any to journey North beyond the wall.&rdquo; Y/N told the two boys, looking up at them as the three stopped running and found themselves in the Godswood&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Of course he just says that to make himself seem as though he knows everything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your father is right.&rdquo; Robb Stark told the young girl, shrugging as he looked over at Jon who was busy trying to keep his eyes from falling on Y/N&rsquo;s form. &ldquo;No one journey&rsquo;s beyond the wall-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes they do.&rdquo; Jon interrupted, a small frown falling upon his face. &ldquo;Father has told us story&rsquo;s of men who have gone beyond the wall.\u201dY/N instantly brightened as she turned to look up at Jon, her eyes sparkling fiercely as she reached out to grip his hand. &quot;Tell me of these story&rsquo;s, Jon!&rdquo; She beamed, not noticing the way the older boys face softened significantly. &ldquo;I can tell when my Father lies&hellip; He just tries to protect me I suppose.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon took a moment to take in just how excited Y/N was before he smiled slightly. &ldquo;Alright&hellip; Father told me of a ranger of the night&rsquo;s watch&hellip; Redwyn was his name. He left Shadow Tower to journey through the unknown during the reign of my ancestor, Dorren Stark&hellip; He was king In the North during that time.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N continued to listen intently to what Jon was telling her, never once looking as though she had grew bored of his words.

Though she was happy that she had managed to find a guaranteed way of taking her to exactly where she wanted to go, Y?N still stuck close to the woods lining the road incase the two of them encountered something or someone.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I still remember the first time I journeyed along this road with my Father.\u201d Y/N began, smiling softly at the thought of Robert Baratheon. \u201cIt was the first time I met Jon and Robb\u2026 Well, that I could remember.\u201d Grey Wind seemed to sadden slightly at the mention of Robb Stark. The wounds the two suffered mentally still fresh. \u201cFather would tell me that the Kingsroad runs from Storm\u2019s End, all the way up to the Wall\u2026 I-I\u2026 I do not know if Jon would want to see me\u2026 He\u2026 He\u2019s all I have left. Of course, you too.\u201d She added upon the look the Direwolf sent her.\u00a0<br><br><b><i>Then</i></b>\u00a0</p><p>\u201dWhy are you not enjoying the feast?\u201d Y/N asked, her voice barely above a whisper as Jon Snow jumped slightly, turning to look over his shoulder at her.\u00a0</p><p>Jon was shooting arrow after arrow in the courtyard of Winterfell while all its residents was inside, enjoying the feast that had been set up due to the kings arrival.\u00a0</p><p>Y/N raised a brow as she stood her ground, her arms behind her back. Jon stares at her for a moment, the features on his face loosing its harshness the longer he stared at Robert Baratheon\u2019s daughter.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCa- Lady Stark has forbid me from going the feast.\u201d He finally admitted, twisting the bow in his hands slightly. \u201cIt would be improper for a bastard to dine with the King.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Y/N said nothing as she continued to stare at Jon. Though there was a thousand and one things she wanted to say, she knew Jon better than most and knew that nothing would persuade him of his worth.\u00a0</p><p>It was then that she pledged to herself that she would show him. One way or another she would show Jon Snow just how much he was worth.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWill you teach me?\u201d She asked, nodding once towards the bow in his grasp. \u201cWhat is it you Starks like to say? Winter is coming? Don\u2019t you think I should be prepared for when that time comes?\u201d She asked, holding back the smile when she noticed how his eyes had sparkles slightly upon being refuted to as a Stark.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOf course, my Lady.\u201d Jon smiled softly, motioning for her to move towards him as he held the bow out for her. \u201cHold this part in your dominant hand.\u201d He muttered, his mouth close to her ear as she did as she was told, gripping the bow in her right hand. \u201cNot to tight.\u201d He whispered, reached around her to gently pull her fingers from the wood.\u00a0</p><p><b><i>Now</i></b>\u00a0</p><p>Y/N stood still for a moment, trying to gain the energy she needed to continue on her journey to The Wall with Grey Wind. She eyed the turning that she was about to pass, smiling sadly as Grey Wind perked up and ran circles around her in excitement.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSorry boy\u2026 We\u2019re\u00a0not going that way this time.\u201d She found herself telling him, watching as he came to a stop, almost understanding the meaning of her words. \u201cWinterfell is no longer a safe place for us. It\u2019s\u00a0alright. You\u2019ll see Jon soon I hope\u2026 Surely you remember him?\u201d</p><p>Grey Wind perked up slightly, more asking beside Y/N and eyeing her face as she grinned through the wave of tiredness that filled her bones.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJon Snow.\u201d She muttered, blissfully. \u201cYou know I love him. I do. I have not told him of this fact. The longer I think on it, the longer I realise that it has always been him.\u201d Grey Wind let out a sound that seemed to come from deep within him as Y/N looked down at him. \u201cYou may even see your brother\u2026 Don\u2019t tell me you have forgotten Ghost?\u201d If anything, Grey Wind seemed to perk up considerably upon hearing the name of one of his own.\u00a0</p><p>Y/N grinned brightly, smoothing a hand over Grey Winds neck before the pair of them set off once more.</p><p>It was once difficult to describe the relationship Y/N and the Direwolf had. However, as time passed and the pair spent more and more time around each-other, a bond that was simply unbreakable began to form rather quickly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you and me now, Boy.\u201d Y/N muttered, running her hand along Grey-Winds back as he walked beside her.</p><hr></p>",

No longer was she able to live as though she did so without a care in the world. No longer did she live, never looking over her shoulder or jumping at the slightest noise that filled her ears.</p><p>&ldquo;Perhaps we&rsquo;ve taken a wrong turning.&rdquo; Y/N softly spoke, sighing as she took a look around her and tried to force herself to recognise anything around her. &ldquo;Or perhaps we were never going in the correct direction&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>She breathed deeply, pushing a few strands of hair from her face and tucking it behind her ear, looking towards the sky. Her companion merely looked around for a threat of any kind.</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; She muttered, twisting as she finally turned to face what she knew was the general direction. &ldquo;North is North. We go North until we cannot go North anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>Her companion looked up at her, his head tilting slightly as though asking if she was serious or not. Y/N raised a brow.</p><p>&ldquo;Do not look at me like that, Grey Wind.&rdquo; She scolded the Direwolf, setting off in the direction she had deemed worthy. &ldquo;Father always taught me to think quickly and not to ponder on the idea too much. After all&hellip; Ours is the fury.&rdquo;</p><p>With that said, Y/N set off once more, her companion and saviour, Grey Wind at her side. &nbsp;<br /><br /><i><b>Then</b></i><br /><br />&ldquo;My Father says that it is impossible for any to journey North beyond the wall.&rdquo; Y/N told the two boys, looking up at them as the three stopped running and found themselves in the Godswood&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Of course he just says that to make himself seem as though he knows everything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your father is right.&rdquo; Robb Stark told the young girl, shrugging as he looked over at Jon who was busy trying to keep his eyes from falling on Y/N&rsquo;s form. &ldquo;No one journey&rsquo;s beyond the wall-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes they do.&rdquo; Jon interrupted, a small frown falling upon his face. &ldquo;Father has told us story&rsquo;s of men who have gone beyond the wall.&rdquo;Y/N instantly brightened as she turned to look up at Jon, her eyes sparkling fiercely as she reached out to grip his hand. \"Tell me of these story&rsquo;s, Jon!&rdquo; She beamed, not noticing the way the older boys face softened significantly. &ldquo;I can tell when my Father lies&hellip; He just tries to protect me I suppose.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon took a moment to take in just how excited Y/N was before he smiled slightly. &ldquo;Alright&hellip; Father told me of a ranger of the night&rsquo;s watch&hellip; Redwyn was his name. He left Shadow Tower to journey through the unknown during the reign of my ancestor, Dorren Stark&hellip; He was king In the North during that time.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N continued to listen intently to what Jon was telling her, never once looking as though she had grew bored of his words. Jon found himself opening up quickly to the girl who was his best friend. Of course, he had to share that title with Robb. However, he couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to be mad over the fact when she looked at him as though he had all the answers to anything she wanted to know.</p><p>&ldquo;We should head back inside. Mother will be wondering where we&rsquo;ve got too.&rdquo; Robb announced, smiling slightly as he watched the pair talk, both pairs of eyes sparkling something crazy. &ldquo;The last thing we want is for mother to decide we&rsquo;re not allowed to roam the keep.\"&nbsp;<br /><br /><b><i>Now</i></b><br /><br />Y/N breathed deeply, trying to force herself to grow used to the cold that had been ingulfing her the further North she walked. She couldn&rsquo;t be sure how many days had passed since she had been forced to start her journey with Grey Wind, but knew that if she stopped to think about it, she&rsquo;d end up crying once more.</p><p>The leaves crunched beneath her feet as she moved through the tree&rsquo;s, her bow in her hand by her side in case it was needed. Grey Wind walked along beside her, his eyes darting in random directions that he heard any sort of noise coming from before he reluctantly turned to face forward once more once it was proven to be no threat.</p><p>Coming to a slow stop, Y/N tilted her head as she looked off towards the right, trying to look through the tree&rsquo;s. \"Grey Wind.&rdquo; She whistled, patting her leg as she took off in the direction, her nerves on high alert as she moved.</p><p>Grey Wind was quick to change directions, padding off in front of her to insure he would be the first to encounter any danger, should there be any.
