his shoes. \u00a0He feels like he\u2019s fourteen again, sitting across from Buffy at The Spoon, trying to get up the courage to tell her he likes Jonah Beck. \u00a0That time, however, he had had the underlying feeling that he was going to come out okay. \u00a0This time, he wasn\u2019t so sure.</p><p>\u201cCyrus come on. \u00a0It\u2019s just one loop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne loop over and over again!\u201d Cyrus fails his arms in panic. \u00a0Buffy rolls her eyes and steals another bite of Marty\u2019s cotton candy. \u00a0The GHC plus Jonah, his boyfriend, Marty, and TJ had all shown up to the Turtle Creek funfair for the weekend. \u00a0While the first part of the morning had been cooing over baby animals and eating copious amounts of ice cream, the afternoon was all rides. \u00a0All. \u00a0The. \u00a0Time. \u00a0</p><p>Cyrus didn\u2019t have anything against rides really, but this was his last weekend before school started back up again (junior year, whoop whoop!) and he really didn\u2019t want his last summer weekend to be tainted with the memory of him throwing up constantly. \u00a0Jonah gives him a sympathetic look before tucking an arm around his boyfriend Walker\u2019s shoulders. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cCy, it\u2019ll be fun!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Cyrus folds his arms and starts walking decidedly away from the lineup to the Fireball. \u00a0He doesn\u2019t care if his friends think he\u2019s lame, even JOnah\u2019s cool new boyfriend. \u00a0All he wants is sugar therapy, and he\u2019s pretty sure he saw some mini donuts around the bumper car attraction.</p><p>\u201cCyrus, wait up!\u201d Cyrus turns and TJ is jogging lightly towards him. \u00a0Cyrus feels his stomach dip slightly in anticipation and he wants to scold himself. \u00a0It\u2019s no secret to anyone that he has a soft spot for TJ. \u00a0EVer since they were pen pals when they were little, he\u2019s held a certain spot in his heart for him. \u00a0Even though they don\u2019t write letters to each other anymore, the connection is still there. \u00a0Lately, however, the soft spot has been growing into something that\u2019s horribly close to a crush and Cyrus can\u2019t stop himself from weakening a bit at the knees whenever TJ looks at him anymore.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going on the Fireball?\u201d He shuffles his feet back and forth awkwardly. \u00a0TJ shrugs.</p><p>\u201cEh. \u00a0I live here. \u00a0I can come back after school Monday if I really want.\u201d \u00a0Cyrus sinks a little remembering. \u00a0They still live in different cities. \u00a0When TJ\u2019s parents split up when he was in the seventh grade and TJ was in the eighth, Cyrus remembers TJ\u2019s petition to get them to move to Shadyside. \u00a0His mom eventually vetoed the idea, claiming that moving TJ and his older sister Amber to a new school halfway through a year was more trouble than it was worth. \u00a0Cyrus also remembers the grumpy way TJ wrote his letters during that time. \u00a0It was one of the last few months they wrote letters before Cyrus\u2019 parents caved and bought him a cellphone and texting became their go to instead of pen and paper.</p><p>\u201cRight. \u00a0School. \u00a0Different schools,\u201d Cyrus can\u2019t stop his gloomy tone from filtering into his voice. \u00a0TJ tosses an arm around Cyrus\u2019 shoulders and guides him to the mini donut stand.</p><p>\u201cHey, if you somehow got a car to drive, you could come to see me every weekend,\u201d TJ\u2019s toothy smile makes Cyrus laugh. \u00a0The last time he tried to drive to Turtle Creek was with his mom one week after getting his license. \u00a0Cyrus had driven the car into a ditch and freaked out for twenty minutes straight before having his car privileges revoked for a year due to \u201cexcessive mental distress\u201d or something. \u00a0He jabs TJ in the ribs.</p><p>\u201cJerk.\u201d</p><p>They buy a bucket of mini donuts and sit on a bench next to the log flume while stuffing their faces. \u00a0Cyrus wipes crystals of sugar off TJ\u2019s face and he smirks at him in return. \u00a0The twisty feeling in Cyrus\u2019 stomach is back and he tries to force it down.</p><p>He knows TJ is gay. \u00a0He remembers the phone call from what\u2019s now almost five years ago. \u00a0He remembers TJ admitting his crush on the boy with fluffy brown hair and he remembers how he was stunned into silence because he felt the same way too. \u00a0That, however, doesn\u2019t seem to ever matter because, in the five years since TJ dropped his major truth bomb, Cyrus has yet to tell him that he\u2019s gay.</p><p>Everyone else knows. \u00a0Literally everyone. \u00a0Even Walker, who after watching them for five minutes, turned to Jonah and asked \u201care they dating?\u201d and Jonah had to answer \u201cno because TJ doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s gay.\u201d \u00a0He\u2019s come out to everyone they\u2019re currently with, but not TJ. \u00a0He doesn\u2019t even have a good explanation. \u00a0It would just be too weird after so long to bring it up. \u00a0Especially when he knows after his disastrous seventh-grade fling with Iris that he could never like a girl again. \u00a0</p><p>Somehow, when he looks at TJ like this though, no hint of any romantic chemistry or anything between them, he gets it. \u00a0Telling him would change things. \u00a0It always would.</p><p>Eventually, the rest of their friends filter back, Andi looking slightly greener than usual. \u00a0Cyrus rubs her back in solidarity. \u00a0They only have a few more minutes before Amber heads back to pick them up, and Marty is the one to suggest they try the Ferris Wheel. \u00a0Andi shakes her head and votes to wait for Amber by the gate, her crush only slightly obvious, and Jonah and Walker follow along behind them. \u00a0TJ extends a hand to Cyrus.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Cy. \u00a0I think you can handle this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Broccoli Boy,\u201d TJ groans but still grins as Cyrus follows him. \u00a0They pair up, as usual, Buffy and Marty arguing with each other as they hold hands and board the ride. \u00a0TJ talks a blue streak in Cyrus\u2019 ear about almost falling off the ride once and Cyrus has to lecture him about safety. \u00a0Once they\u2019re up in the air though, his heart thuds in his chest as he realizes just how close they\u2019re sitting. \u00a0TJ\u2019s still talking but Cyrus is only focusing on how his lips curve around his smile and how TJ is just so damn pretty.</p><p>\u201cRight?\u201d \u00a0Cyrus looked up in panic at TJ\u2019s amused face.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you weren\u2019t listening to me,\u201d TJ smirked. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI was! \u00a0I just happened to have zoned out right before your question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, what was I talking about?\u201d \u00a0Cyrus stays silent and TJ erupts into laughter.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a dork, dude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d Cyrus shrugs before swallowing his nerves and tucking his head into TJ\u2019s shoulder. \u00a0TJ wraps his arm around Cyrus\u2019 shoulder and he\u2019s hit with the sudden yearning to yell \u201cI\u2019m gay!\u201d from the rooftops. \u00a0Not that he will. \u00a0Maybe when he\u2019s married and TJ\u2019s the best man.</p><p>The ride ends soon after that, and the teens stumble together into Amber\u2019s SUV that she stole from their mother, Jonah\u2019s beat up truck and Andi\u2019s bright yellow Jeep. \u00a0Cyrus is saying goodbye to Marty when TJ bursts into their conversation.</p><p>\u201cHey, wanna sleepover? \u00a0Not you,\u201d he directs to Marty before refocusing on Cyrus. \u00a0Cyrus\u2019 eyes widen.</p><p>\u201cAndi\u2019s my ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drive you back tomorrow before work.\u201d \u00a0It\u2019s the slight desperation in TJ\u2019s eyes that makes Cyrus cave. \u00a0He retracts his goodbye to Marty, they\u2019ll be in the same car in like twenty minutes, and instead turns to say goodbye to the rest of his friends.</p><p>\u201cMake a move, Goodman,\u201d Buffy says in kind frustration as he hugs her goodbye.</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d Cyrus smiles sweetly. \u00a0He hugs Andi goodbye, checks his phone again to make sure that staying over is okay, and bounds back into Amber\u2019s car. \u00a0She grins at him in the rearview mirror.</p><p>\u201cHey, Cyrus!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Amber. \u00a0When do classes start?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext week, I move out on Saturday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d Cyrus nods. \u00a0Amber had graduated the year before and chosen to go to Drexel University for dance. \u00a0They were all proud of her but Andi was mourning how far away she would be in Pennsylvania. \u00a0</p><p>TJ slid into the front seat after completing a complicated handshake with Jonah and smiled deeply at Cyrus.</p><p>\u201cOkay let\u2019s go. Drop off Mr. The Party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill offended I\u2019m not invited.\u201d</p><p>~</p><p><i>Dear TJ,</i></p><p><i>Today I got pajamas with stegosauruses on them and I was so happy. My mom says they\u2019re an early birthday present but my birthday is in three months so it seems kinda weird to me. Anyways, I also joined a science club with Andi. She joined to make pretty colors with chemicals and I joined to be smarter. Although I\u2019m pretty sure all we mix is lemon juice and baking soda. How was your day? \u00a0I hope you made th-</i></p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re reading that,\u201d TJ teased as he tossed a sleeping bag at Cyrus. Cyrus smiled and laid down his letter.</p><p>\u201cI was a cute kid. I like to remember.\u201d TJ laughed and pressed play on the John Mulaney special they were watching for the fourth time and settled back into his blanket mold. Cyrus joined him after unzipping the sleeping bag to lay on his legs.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you kept those,\u201d Cyrus shakes his head in disbelief. TJ gives him a look.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell yeah. But that\u2019s my kinda thing. Not yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have layers, Underdog,\u201d the clich\u00e9 nickname slipped through TJ\u2019s lips smoothly and Cyrus blushed at remembering the day on the swings he had given it to him.</p><p>He loves remembering his friendship with TJ. \u00a0It makes him feel more warm and fuzzy inside than usual. \u00a0That\u2019s part of the reason that he hides his sexuality like he does. \u00a0He doesn\u2019t want TJ to think he doesn\u2019t trust him or that he wasn\u2019t important enough to know. \u00a0He doesn\u2019t ever want TJ to think he doesn\u2019t mean anything. \u00a0</p><p>Instead of pressing him on his layers, or even talking about his own, Cyrus snuggles down and continued to laugh at the horse in a hospital sketch.</p><p>After all, he\u2019s got some layers too.</p><p><br/></p><p>taglist &lt;3:</p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3KYGYYNAKvqZ_XVFoSWXCg\" target=\"_blank\">@illbeyourreasonwhy</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6bUlRhshKvuSxiEWBPW-yw\" target=\"_blank\">@tyrusflavoredtea</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLM57lFD1V9RM3TXt1oUHMw\" target=\"_blank\">@homosexualearthworm</a> @proshipperandfangirl <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3EOu5JFaQ22e0aezi7yabw\" target=\"_blank\">@bambikippen</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZ6o81sOB_AIbn1mQtOYl5g\" target=\"_blank\">@unsteady-but-trying</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlmBX-P-uv1w3If0XlQn3qA\" target=\"_blank\">@sweet-cyrus</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgsn-IgCj9QcqKNDenfL8Sw\" target=\"_blank\">@zooperx</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD5xwG2u8vIh_s73zuIGl0g\" target=\"_blank\">@ibroughtachallah</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7JCuY1gY2xFiHU4UjOlUIw\" target=\"_blank\">@rellahad</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mk7cFx5v5eG4XAX0I1CIMMA\" target=\"_blank\">@cool-anonymous-tyrus-shipper</a></p>",

\u00a0When TJ\u2019s parents split up when he was in the seventh grade and TJ was in the eighth, Cyrus remembers TJ\u2019s petition to get them to move to Shadyside. \u00a0His mom eventually vetoed the idea, claiming that moving TJ and his older sister Amber to a new school halfway through a year was more trouble than it was worth. \u00a0Cyrus also remembers the grumpy way TJ wrote his letters during that time. \u00a0It was one of the last few months they wrote letters before Cyrus\u2019 parents caved and bought him a cellphone and texting became their go to instead of pen and paper.</p><p>\u201cRight. \u00a0School. \u00a0Different schools,\u201d Cyrus can\u2019t stop his gloomy tone from filtering into his voice. \u00a0TJ tosses an arm around Cyrus\u2019 shoulders and guides him to the mini donut stand.</p><p>\u201cHey, if you somehow got a car to drive, you could come to see me every weekend,\u201d TJ\u2019s toothy smile makes Cyrus laugh. \u00a0The last time he tried to drive to Turtle Creek was with his mom one week after getting his license. \u00a0Cyrus had driven the car into a ditch and freaked out for twenty minutes straight before having his car privileges revoked for a year due to \u201cexcessive mental distress\u201d or something. \u00a0He jabs TJ in the ribs.</p><p>\u201cJerk.\u201d</p><p>They buy a bucket of mini donuts and sit on a bench next to the log flume while stuffing their faces. \u00a0Cyrus wipes crystals of sugar off TJ\u2019s face and he smirks at him in return. \u00a0The twisty feeling in Cyrus\u2019 stomach is back and he tries to force it down.</p><p>He knows TJ is gay. \u00a0He remembers the phone call from what\u2019s now almost five years ago. \u00a0He remembers TJ admitting his crush on the boy with fluffy brown hair and he remembers how he was stunned into silence because he felt the same way too. \u00a0That, however, doesn\u2019t seem to ever matter because, in the five years since TJ dropped his major truth bomb, Cyrus has yet to tell him that he\u2019s gay.</p><p>Everyone else knows. \u00a0Literally everyone. \u00a0Even Walker, who after watching them for five minutes, turned to Jonah and asked \u201care they dating?\u201d and Jonah had to answer \u201cno because TJ doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s gay.\u201d \u00a0He\u2019s come out to everyone they\u2019re currently with, but not TJ. \u00a0He doesn\u2019t even have a good explanation. \u00a0It would just be too weird after so long to bring it up. \u00a0Especially when he knows after his disastrous seventh-grade fling with Iris that he could never like a girl again. \u00a0</p><p>Somehow, when he looks at TJ like this though, no hint of any romantic chemistry or anything between them, he gets it. \u00a0Telling him would change things. \u00a0It always would.</p><p>Eventually, the rest of their friends filter back, Andi looking slightly greener than usual. \u00a0Cyrus rubs her back in solidarity. \u00a0They only have a few more minutes before Amber heads back to pick them up, and Marty is the one to suggest they try the Ferris Wheel. \u00a0Andi shakes her head and votes to wait for Amber by the gate, her crush only slightly obvious, and Jonah and Walker follow along behind them. \u00a0TJ extends a hand to Cyrus.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Cy. \u00a0I think you can handle this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Broccoli Boy,\u201d TJ groans but still grins as Cyrus follows him. \u00a0They pair up, as usual, Buffy and Marty arguing with each other as they hold hands and board the ride. \u00a0TJ talks a blue streak in Cyrus\u2019 ear about almost falling off the ride once and Cyrus has to lecture him about safety. \u00a0Once they\u2019re up in the air though, his heart thuds in his chest as he realizes just how close they\u2019re sitting. \u00a0TJ\u2019s still talking but Cyrus is only focusing on how his lips curve around his smile and how TJ is just so damn pretty.</p><p>\u201cRight?\u201d \u00a0Cyrus looked up in panic at TJ\u2019s amused face.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you weren\u2019t listening to me,\u201d TJ smirked. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI was! \u00a0I just happened to have zoned out right before your question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, what was I talking about?\u201d \u00a0Cyrus stays silent and TJ erupts into laughter.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a dork, dude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d Cyrus shrugs before swallowing his nerves and tucking his head into TJ\u2019s shoulder. \u00a0TJ wraps his arm around Cyrus\u2019 shoulder and he\u2019s hit with the sudden yearning to yell \u201cI\u2019m gay!\u201d from the rooftops. \u00a0Not that he will. \u00a0Maybe when he\u2019s married and TJ\u2019s the best man.</p><p>The ride ends soon after that, and the teens stumble together into Amber\u2019s SUV that she stole from their mother, Jonah\u2019s beat up truck and Andi\u2019s bright yellow Jeep. \u00a0Cyrus is saying goodbye to Marty when TJ bursts into their conversation.</p><p>\u201cHey, wanna sleepover? \u00a0Not you,\u201d he directs to Marty before refocusing on Cyrus. \u00a0Cyrus\u2019 eyes widen.</p><p>\u201cAndi\u2019s my ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drive you back tomorrow before work.\u201d \u00a0It\u2019s the slight desperation in TJ\u2019s eyes that makes Cyrus cave. \u00a0He retracts his goodbye to Marty, they\u2019ll be in the same car in like twenty minutes, and instead turns to say goodbye to the rest of his friends.</p><p>\u201cMake a move, Goodman,\u201d Buffy says in kind frustration as he hugs her goodbye.</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d Cyrus smiles sweetly. \u00a0He hugs Andi goodbye, checks his phone again to make sure that staying over is okay, and bounds back into Amber\u2019s car. \u00a0She grins at him in the rearview mirror.</p><p>\u201cHey, Cyrus!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Amber. \u00a0When do classes start?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext week, I move out on Saturday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d Cyrus nods. \u00a0Amber had graduated the year before and chosen to go to Drexel University for dance. \u00a0They were all proud of her but Andi was mourning how far away she would be in Pennsylvania. \u00a0</p><p>TJ slid into the front seat after completing a complicated handshake with Jonah and smiled deeply at Cyrus.</p><p>\u201cOkay let\u2019s go. Drop off Mr. The Party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill offended I\u2019m not invited.\u201d</p><p>~</p><p><i>Dear TJ,</i></p><p><i>Today I got pajamas with stegosauruses on them and I was so happy. My mom says they\u2019re an early birthday present but my birthday is in three months so it seems kinda weird to me. Anyways, I also joined a science club with Andi.

Cyrus smiled and laid down his letter.</p><p>\u201cI was a cute kid. I like to remember.\u201d TJ laughed and pressed play on the John Mulaney special they were watching for the fourth time and settled back into his blanket mold. Cyrus joined him after unzipping the sleeping bag to lay on his legs.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you kept those,\u201d Cyrus shakes his head in disbelief. TJ gives him a look.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell yeah. But that\u2019s my kinda thing. Not yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have layers, Underdog,\u201d the clich\u00e9 nickname slipped through TJ\u2019s lips smoothly and Cyrus blushed at remembering the day on the swings he had given it to him.</p><p>He loves remembering his friendship with TJ. \u00a0It makes him feel more warm and fuzzy inside than usual. \u00a0That\u2019s part of the reason that he hides his sexuality like he does. \u00a0He doesn\u2019t want TJ to think he doesn\u2019t trust him or that he wasn\u2019t important enough to know. \u00a0He doesn\u2019t ever want TJ to think he doesn\u2019t mean anything. \u00a0</p><p>Instead of pressing him on his layers, or even talking about his own, Cyrus snuggles down and continued to laugh at the horse in a hospital sketch.</p><p>After all, he\u2019s got some layers too.</p><p><br></p><p>taglist &lt;3:</p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3KYGYYNAKvqZ_XVFoSWXCg\" target=\"_blank\">@illbeyourreasonwhy</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6bUlRhshKvuSxiEWBPW-yw\" target=\"_blank\">@tyrusflavoredtea</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLM57lFD1V9RM3TXt1oUHMw\" target=\"_blank\">@homosexualearthworm</a> @proshipperandfangirl <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3EOu5JFaQ22e0aezi7yabw\" target=\"_blank\">@bambikippen</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZ6o81sOB_AIbn1mQtOYl5g\" target=\"_blank\">@unsteady-but-trying</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlmBX-P-uv1w3If0XlQn3qA\" target=\"_blank\">@sweet-cyrus</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgsn-IgCj9QcqKNDenfL8Sw\" target=\"_blank\">@zooperx</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD5xwG2u8vIh_s73zuIGl0g\" target=\"_blank\">@ibroughtachallah</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7JCuY1gY2xFiHU4UjOlUIw\" target=\"_blank\">@rellahad</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mk7cFx5v5eG4XAX0I1CIMMA\" target=\"_blank\">@cool-anonymous-tyrus-shipper</a></p>",

his shoes. \u00a0He feels like he\u2019s fourteen again, sitting across from Buffy at The Spoon, trying to get up the courage to tell her he likes Jonah Beck. \u00a0That time, however, he had had the underlying feeling that he was going to come out okay. \u00a0This time, he wasn\u2019t so sure.</p><p>\u201cCyrus come on. \u00a0It\u2019s just one loop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne loop over and over again!\u201d Cyrus fails his arms in panic. \u00a0Buffy rolls her eyes and steals another bite of Marty\u2019s cotton candy. \u00a0The GHC plus Jonah, his boyfriend, Marty, and TJ had all shown up to the Turtle Creek funfair for the weekend. \u00a0While the first part of the morning had been cooing over baby animals and eating copious amounts of ice cream, the afternoon was all rides. \u00a0All. \u00a0The. \u00a0Time. \u00a0</p><p>Cyrus didn\u2019t have anything against rides really, but this was his last weekend before school started back up again (junior year, whoop whoop!) and he really didn\u2019t want his last summer weekend to be tainted with the memory of him throwing up constantly. \u00a0Jonah gives him a sympathetic look before tucking an arm around his boyfriend Walker\u2019s shoulders. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cCy, it\u2019ll be fun!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Cyrus folds his arms and starts walking decidedly away from the lineup to the Fireball. \u00a0He doesn\u2019t care if his friends think he\u2019s lame, even JOnah\u2019s cool new boyfriend. \u00a0All he wants is sugar therapy, and he\u2019s pretty sure he saw some mini donuts around the bumper car attraction.</p><p>\u201cCyrus, wait up!\u201d Cyrus turns and TJ is jogging lightly towards him. \u00a0Cyrus feels his stomach dip slightly in anticipation and he wants to scold himself. \u00a0It\u2019s no secret to anyone that he has a soft spot for TJ. \u00a0EVer since they were pen pals when they were little, he\u2019s held a certain spot in his heart for him. \u00a0Even though they don\u2019t write letters to each other anymore, the connection is still there. \u00a0Lately, however, the soft spot has been growing into something that\u2019s horribly close to a crush and Cyrus can\u2019t stop himself from weakening a bit at the knees whenever TJ looks at him anymore.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going on the Fireball?\u201d He shuffles his feet back and forth awkwardly. \u00a0TJ shrugs.</p><p>\u201cEh. \u00a0I live here. \u00a0I can come back after school Monday if I really want.\u201d \u00a0Cyrus sinks a little remembering. \u00a0They still live in different cities. \u00a0When TJ\u2019s parents split up when he was in the seventh grade and TJ was in the eighth, Cyrus remembers TJ\u2019s petition to get them to move to Shadyside. \u00a0His mom eventually vetoed the idea, claiming that moving TJ and his older sister Amber to a new school halfway through a year was more trouble than it was worth. \u00a0Cyrus also remembers the grumpy way TJ wrote his letters during that time. \u00a0It was one of the last few months they wrote letters before Cyrus\u2019 parents caved and bought him a cellphone and texting became their go to instead of pen and paper.</p><p>\u201cRight. \u00a0School. \u00a0Different schools,\u201d Cyrus can\u2019t stop his gloomy tone from filtering into his voice. \u00a0TJ tosses an arm around Cyrus\u2019 shoulders and guides him to the mini donut stand.</p><p>\u201cHey, if you somehow got a car to drive, you could come to see me every weekend,\u201d TJ\u2019s toothy smile makes Cyrus laugh. \u00a0The last time he tried to drive to Turtle Creek was with his mom one week after getting his license. \u00a0Cyrus had driven the car into a ditch and freaked out for twenty minutes straight before having his car privileges revoked for a year due to \u201cexcessive mental distress\u201d or something. \u00a0He jabs TJ in the ribs.</p><p>\u201cJerk.\u201d</p><p>They buy a bucket of mini donuts and sit on a bench

things. \u00a0It always would.</p><p>Eventually, the rest of their friends filter back, Andi looking slightly greener than usual. \u00a0Cyrus rubs her back in solidarity. \u00a0They only have a few more minutes before Amber heads back to pick them up, and Marty is the one to suggest they try the Ferris Wheel. \u00a0Andi shakes her head and votes to wait for Amber by the gate, her crush only slightly obvious, and Jonah and Walker follow along behind them. \u00a0TJ extends a hand to Cyrus.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Cy. \u00a0I think you can handle this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Broccoli Boy,\u201d TJ groans but still grins as Cyrus follows him. \u00a0They pair up, as usual, Buffy and Marty arguing with each other as they hold hands and board the ride. \u00a0TJ talks a blue streak in Cyrus\u2019 ear about almost falling off the ride once and Cyrus has to lecture him about safety. \u00a0Once they\u2019re up in the air though, his heart thuds in his chest as he realizes just how close they\u2019re sitting. \u00a0TJ\u2019s still talking but Cyrus is only focusing on how his lips curve around his smile and how TJ is just so damn pretty.</p><p>\u201cRight?\u201d \u00a0Cyrus looked up in panic at TJ\u2019s amused face.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you weren\u2019t listening to me,\u201d TJ smirked. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI was! \u00a0I just happened to have zoned out right before your question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, what was I talking about?\u201d \u00a0Cyrus stays silent and TJ erupts into laughter.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a dork, dude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d Cyrus shrugs before swallowing his nerves and tucking his head into TJ\u2019s shoulder. \u00a0TJ wraps his arm around Cyrus\u2019 shoulder and he\u2019s hit

that, and the teens stumble together into Amber\u2019s SUV that she stole from their mother, Jonah\u2019s beat up truck and Andi\u2019s bright yellow Jeep. \u00a0Cyrus is saying goodbye to Marty when

stomach is sinking into his shoes. &nbsp;He feels like he&rsquo;s fourteen again, sitting across from Buffy at The Spoon, trying to get up the courage to tell her he likes Jonah Beck. &nbsp;That time, however, he had had the underlying feeling that he was going to come out okay. &nbsp;This time, he wasn&rsquo;t so sure.</p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus come on. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s just one loop.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;One loop over and over again!&rdquo; Cyrus fails his arms in panic. &nbsp;Buffy rolls her eyes and steals another bite of Marty&rsquo;s cotton candy. &nbsp;The GHC plus Jonah, his boyfriend, Marty, and TJ had all shown up to the Turtle Creek funfair for the weekend. &nbsp;While the first part of the morning had been cooing over baby animals and eating copious amounts of ice cream, the afternoon was all rides. &nbsp;All. &nbsp;The. &nbsp;Time. &nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus didn&rsquo;t have anything against rides really, but this was his last weekend before school started back up again (junior year, whoop whoop!) and he really didn&rsquo;t want his last summer weekend to be tainted with the memory of him throwing up constantly. &nbsp;Jonah gives him a sympathetic look before tucking an arm around his boyfriend Walker&rsquo;s shoulders. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Cy, it&rsquo;ll be fun!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Cyrus folds his arms and starts walking decidedly away from the lineup to the Fireball. &nbsp;He doesn&rsquo;t care if his friends think he&rsquo;s lame, even JOnah&rsquo;s cool new boyfriend. &nbsp;All he wants is sugar therapy, and he&rsquo;s pretty sure he saw some mini donuts around the bumper car attraction.</p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus, wait up!&rdquo; Cyrus turns and TJ is jogging lightly towards him. &nbsp;Cyrus feels his stomach dip slightly in anticipation and he wants to scold himself. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s no secret to anyone that he has a soft spot for TJ. &nbsp;EVer since they were pen pals when they were little, he&rsquo;s held a certain spot in his heart for him. &nbsp;Even though they don&rsquo;t write letters to each other anymore, the connection is still there. &nbsp;Lately, however, the soft spot has been growing into something that&rsquo;s horribly close to a crush and Cyrus can&rsquo;t stop himself from weakening a bit at the knees whenever TJ looks at him anymore.</p><p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going on the Fireball?&rdquo; He shuffles his feet back and forth awkwardly. &nbsp;TJ shrugs.</p><p>&ldquo;Eh. &nbsp;I live here. &nbsp;I can come back after school Monday if I really want.&rdquo; &nbsp;Cyrus sinks a little remembering. &nbsp;They still live in different cities. &nbsp;When TJ&rsquo;s parents split up when he was in the seventh grade and TJ was in the eighth, Cyrus remembers TJ&rsquo;s petition to get them to move to Shadyside. &nbsp;His mom eventually vetoed the idea, claiming that moving TJ and his older sister Amber to a new school halfway through a year was more trouble than it was worth. &nbsp;Cyrus also remembers the grumpy way TJ wrote his letters during that time. &nbsp;It was one of the last few months they wrote letters before Cyrus&rsquo; parents caved and bought him a cellphone and texting became their go to instead of pen and paper.</p><p>&ldquo;Right. &nbsp;School. &nbsp;Different schools,&rdquo; Cyrus can&rsquo;t stop his gloomy tone from filtering into his voice. &nbsp;TJ tosses an arm around Cyrus&rsquo; shoulders and guides him to the mini donut stand.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, if you somehow got a car to drive, you could come to see me every weekend,&rdquo; TJ&rsquo;s toothy smile makes Cyrus laugh. &nbsp;The last time he tried to drive to Turtle Creek was with his mom one week after getting his license. &nbsp;Cyrus had driven the car into a ditch and freaked out for twenty minutes straight before having his car privileges revoked for a year due to &ldquo;excessive mental distress&rdquo; or something. &nbsp;He jabs TJ in the ribs.</p><p>&ldquo;Jerk.&rdquo;</p><p>They buy a bucket of mini donuts and sit on a bench next to the log flume while stuffing their faces. &nbsp;Cyrus wipes crystals of sugar off TJ&rsquo;s face and he smirks at him in return. &nbsp;The twisty feeling in Cyrus&rsquo; stomach is back and he tries to force it down.</p><p>He knows TJ is gay. &nbsp;He remembers the phone call from what&rsquo;s now almost five years ago. &nbsp;He remembers TJ admitting his crush on the boy with fluffy brown hair and he remembers how he was stunned into silence because he felt the same way too. &nbsp;That, however, doesn&rsquo;t seem to ever matter because, in the five years since TJ dropped his major truth bomb, Cyrus has yet to tell him that he&rsquo;s gay.</p><p>Everyone else knows. &nbsp;Literally everyone. &nbsp;Even Walker, who after watching them for five minutes, turned to Jonah and asked &ldquo;are they dating?&rdquo; and Jonah had to answer &ldquo;no because TJ doesn&rsquo;t know he&rsquo;s gay.&rdquo; &nbsp;He&rsquo;s come out to everyone they&rsquo;re currently with, but not TJ. &nbsp;He doesn&rsquo;t even have a good explanation. &nbsp;It would just be too weird after so long to bring it up. &nbsp;Especially when he knows after his disastrous seventh-grade fling with Iris that he could never like a girl again. &nbsp;</p><p>Somehow, when he looks at TJ like this though, no hint of any romantic chemistry or anything between them, he gets it. &nbsp;Telling him would change things. &nbsp;It always would.</p><p>Eventually, the rest of their friends filter back, Andi looking slightly greener than usual. &nbsp;Cyrus rubs her back in solidarity. &nbsp;They only have a few more minutes before Amber heads back to pick them up, and Marty is the one to suggest they try the Ferris Wheel. &nbsp;Andi shakes her head and votes to wait for Amber by the gate, her crush only slightly obvious, and Jonah and Walker follow along behind them. &nbsp;TJ extends a hand to Cyrus.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, Cy. &nbsp;I think you can handle this one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, Broccoli Boy,&rdquo; TJ groans but still grins as Cyrus follows him. &nbsp;They pair up, as usual, Buffy and Marty arguing with each other as they hold hands and board the ride. &nbsp;TJ talks a blue streak in Cyrus&rsquo; ear about almost falling off the ride once and Cyrus has to lecture him about safety. &nbsp;Once they&rsquo;re up in the air though, his heart thuds in his chest as he realizes just how close they&rsquo;re sitting. &nbsp;TJ&rsquo;s still talking but Cyrus is only focusing on how his lips curve around his smile and how TJ is just so damn pretty.</p><p>&ldquo;Right?&rdquo; &nbsp;Cyrus looked up in panic at TJ&rsquo;s amused face.</p><p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I knew you weren&rsquo;t listening to me,&rdquo; TJ smirked. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I was! &nbsp;I just happened to have zoned out right before your question.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, what was I talking about?&rdquo; &nbsp;Cyrus stays silent and TJ erupts into laughter.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a dork, dude.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I know,&rdquo; Cyrus shrugs before swallowing his nerves and tucking his head into TJ&rsquo;s shoulder. &nbsp;TJ wraps his arm around Cyrus&rsquo; shoulder and he&rsquo;s hit with the sudden yearning to yell &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gay!&rdquo; from the rooftops. &nbsp;Not that he will. &nbsp;Maybe when he&rsquo;s married and TJ&rsquo;s the best man.</p><p>The ride ends soon after that, and the teens stumble together into Amber&rsquo;s SUV that she stole from their mother, Jonah&rsquo;s beat up truck and Andi&rsquo;s bright yellow Jeep. &nbsp;Cyrus is saying goodbye to Marty when TJ bursts into their conversation.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, wanna sleepover? &nbsp;Not you,&rdquo; he directs to Marty before refocusing on Cyrus. &nbsp;Cyrus&rsquo; eyes widen.</p><p>&ldquo;Andi&rsquo;s my ride.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drive you back tomorrow before work.&rdquo; &nbsp;It&rsquo;s the slight desperation in TJ&rsquo;s eyes that makes Cyrus cave. &nbsp;He retracts his goodbye to Marty, they&rsquo;ll be in the same car in like twenty minutes, and instead turns to say goodbye to the rest of his friends.</p><p>&ldquo;Make a move, Goodman,&rdquo; Buffy says in kind frustration as he hugs her goodbye.</p><p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; Cyrus smiles sweetly. &nbsp;He hugs Andi goodbye, checks his phone again to make sure that staying over is okay, and bounds back into Amber&rsquo;s car. &nbsp;She grins at him in the rearview mirror.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Cyrus!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Amber. &nbsp;When do classes start?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Next week, I move out on Saturday.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cool,&rdquo; Cyrus nods. &nbsp;Amber had graduated the year before and chosen to go to Drexel University for dance. &nbsp;They were all proud of her but Andi was mourning how far away she would be in Pennsylvania. &nbsp;</p><p>TJ slid into the front seat after completing a complicated handshake with Jonah and smiled deeply at Cyrus.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay let&rsquo;s go. Drop off Mr. The Party.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Still offended I&rsquo;m not invited.&rdquo;</p><p>~</p><p><i>Dear TJ,</i></p><p><i>Today I got pajamas with stegosauruses on them and I was so happy.
