That tony\u2019s life and his marriage was\nfalling apart, just as Clint and Natasha got to start their marriage. He knew\nSteeve had been shocked when Tony had given in so easily. But maybe Bucky was\nright, maybe Tony and Steve weren\u2019t meant to be together. But through all of\nthis, in the back of Tony\u2019s mind, he couldn\u2019t help but think, <i>this can\u2019t be over because I\u2019m still in love\nwith you</i>. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry Tony.\u201d Steve whispered and for once, he had\nthe look of love and adoration that Steve had always worn when looking at Tony.\nIt was only there for a second before he looked away. </p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to tell Peter?\u201d Tony asked softly, Steve\nsighed and shrugged.</p><p>\u201cHe already knows that I cheated, I\u2019m sure he already hates\nme, so I\u2019ll deliver the news.\u201d Tony shook his head.</p><p>\u201cno. I\u2019ll do it.\u201d Tony hated the idea of his kid finding out\nwithout him being there. Peter would need Tony through this, Tony wouldn\u2019t back\nout on his son now.</p><p>\u201cwe could do it together?\u201d Steve offered and Tony squeezed\nhis eyes shut. <i>together</i>. </p><p>\u201cokay.\u201d It seemed that Tony\u2019s brain was now on autopilot.\nAnything else was too much. </p><p>\u201cSteve?\u201d Tony asked suddenly and Steve looked back at him.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d his voice was flat, his face stone, his eyes cold. </p><p>\u201cWhere did it go wrong?\u201d Tony asked softly, he watched as an\nemotion floated to the surface of Steve\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Then steve walked out of the house and tony\nresisted the urge to break down into tears.</p><hr><p>The dinner was painfully awkward. Al had tried to ask about\nPeter\u2019s dads again and Peter had shut them down instantly. </p><p>\u201cthey\u2019re fine. Everything\u2019s fine. They\u2019ve just been working\nlots.\u201d Both Wade and May shot him strange looks.</p><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s good.\u201d Al then asked May a question and Peter\nallowed himself to zone out. He didn\u2019t want to be at home but he certainly\ndidn\u2019t want to be in the middle of a dinner with Wade. Peter wondered if it was\nstill too late to run. </p><p>\u201cIs the food okay?\u201d May asked and Peter forced himself to\nfocus on reality.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s delicious.\u201d May raised a brow at Peter\u2019s food,\nhe\u2019d barely touched it.</p><p>\u201cit is delicious May, thank you so much.\u201d Wade told her and\nshe smiled.</p><p>\u201c<i>Thank you Wade</i>.\u201d\nShe said while glaring at Peter.</p><p>\u201cit is delicious, now you boys run along, May and I have to\ncatch up privately now.\u201d Peter and Wade both rolled their eyes but stood,\nknowing it was better to follow Al\u2019s orders than to ignore them. Peter and Wade\ndumped their dishes into the kitchen sink. Wade opened his mouth but Peter just\nwalked out. He knew he was being an asshole, but he was allowing it for\ntonight. He just found out his pops had had an affair, his dads were probably\ngoing to break up and he hadn\u2019t slept for the past two days. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on Peter?\u201d Wade asked and Peter groaned.</p><p>\u201cWould you just leave me alone?\u201d Peter asked and flopped\nonto the bottom bunk in the guest bedroom. May called it the guest bedroom, but\nit was really Peter\u2019s room. Peter\u2019s head hit a bag and he swore, when he pulled\nback he noticed it was Wade\u2019s backpack.</p><p>\u201cwhy is your stuff here?\u201d Peter rubbed his forehead and Wade\nsuddenly looked sheepish.</p><p>\u201cMay\u2019s taking me in sort of.\u201d Wade looked down at his feet.</p><p>\u201cTaking you in?\u201d Peter asked.</p><p>\u201cAl asked her if I could stay here for the next six months\nand May agreed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix months?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix months is a big deal, what\u2019s going on?\u201d Peter asked and\nWade took a deep breath. He began fidgeting with the sleeve of his jacket and\nPeter knew to back down. He wasn\u2019t ready to say whatever was going on. </p><p>\u201cit\u2019s-\u201c but it was clear he didn\u2019t want to say it, so Peter\ninterrupted</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay Wade, you don\u2019t have to tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks Peter.\u201d The room was silent and then Wade sat down\non the bunk bed, Peter stared at the spot where his knee and Wade\u2019s touched.</p><p>\u201cstill obsessed with wham?\u201d Peter asked and he felt Wade\nrelax.</p><p>\u201cBest album of all time.\u201d Peter rolled his eyes, but it was\na relief. To know that even though everything in Peter\u2019s world was changing and\nreshuffling, Wade was still the same.</p><p>\u201cdebateable.\u201d Peter murmured and Wade bumped his shoulder\ninto Peter\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a dork.\u201d It felt good to be smiling with Wade\nagain. It felt good to simply be smiling.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you take the bottom bunk?\u201d Peter asked suddenly, and\nWade began to fidget with his jacket sleeve again.</p><p>\u201cA habit I guess.\u201d Wade shrugged but Peter couldn\u2019t help but\nsmile. When they were younger, Peter always took the top bunk. Whenever he had\nnightmares he would jump up and stick to the roof, at least he didn\u2019t wake up\nWade then. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for being such an asshole.\u201d Peter said softly and\nhe could feel Wade studying Peter\u2019s profile.</p><hr><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for being such an asshole.\u201d Wade lifted hid head\nand looked at Peter. He\u2019d forgotten how much he had missed Peter. How comforting\nit was to just be sitting beside him. Wade studied Peter\u2019s profile, taking not\nof how exhausted he looked. He wished Peter would open up, tell him what\u2019s\ngoing on. But things with Wade and Peter hadn\u2019t been easy and good like that,\nnot in a long time. Wade missed those days where he and Peter would just talk\nfor hours on end about anything and everything. </p><p>\u201cPeter\u2026\u201d but Wade trailed off, watching as if the world was\nin slow motion, as Peter looked at Wade.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Peter\u2019s big brown eyes were wide and studying Wade\u2019s\nface. Wade memorised Peter\u2019s face and hung his head.</p><p>\u201cwhy did we stop talking?\u201d Wade wondered, but he knew that\nanswer. </p><p>\u201cYou were popular and when push came to shove, you chose\nyour popular friends over me.\u201d Peter shrugged and Wade shook his head.</p><p>\u201cBut you were my best friend.\u201d He whispered, Peter didn\u2019t\nhear it.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve got Flash and I\u2019ve got Ned and we\u2019re both\nexactly where we\u2019re meant to be.\u201d Peter was now staring at the roof. Wade\nwanted to tell Peter that he missed him, missed their friendship. But the words\ndied in his throat. </p><p>\u201cYeah, exactly where we\u2019re meant to be.\u201d Wade echoed, not\nbelieving it.</p><hr><p>Steve wanted to scream, he tried to break the barriers in\nhis mind, but he was trapped. He couldn\u2019t tell tony the truth, he couldn\u2019t tell\nanyone the truth. He\u2019d tried talking to natasha and clint and bruce and any\navenger he could find, but the words died in his throat every time. He\u2019d tried\nto write it down, but his hand would just throw the pen across the room. He couldn\u2019t\ncommunicate this to anyone other than Bucky, who was just as trapped as Steve was.\n</p><p>\u201cDammit.\u201d Steve grunted as his hand suddenly spasmed, sending\nthe pen across the room.</p><p>\u201cPops?\u201d it was Peter\u2019s voice and Steve inhaled sharply.</p><p>\u201chey Peter.\u201d Steve forced himself to smile, but he couldn\u2019t\nmanage it.</p><p>\u201cCan I talk to you?\u201d Peter asked and Steve forced himself to\nnod.</p><p>\u201cof course, what\u2019s going on?\u201d Peter let out a deep sigh. </p><p>\u201cDad told me, about you and Bucky. I want to know, are you guys\ngetting a divorce?\u201d Peter asked and Steve felt his stomach twist and churn.</p><p>\u201cTony and I agreed we\u2019d have that conversation with you together.\u201d\nSteve told him gently.</p><p>\u201cI want to know now.\u201d Peter said firmly and Steve swallowed.\nHe twisted his wedding ring and took a deep shaky breath.</p><p>\u201cit wasn\u2019t an easy decision Peter.\u201d Steve murmured soflty.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re breaking up?\u201d Peter\u2019s voice was shaking and Steve\nsqueezed his eyes shut.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as simple as you think.\u201d Steve told him.</p><p>\u201cThen explain to me how complicated it is. How could you do\nthis?\u201d Peter demanded and Steve began shaking.</p><p>\u201cPeter-\u201c</p><p>\u201cTell me how you could ruin our family!\u201d Peter hissed and Steve\nfelt tears prick his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to ruin our family.\u201d Steve swore but he knew\nPeter didn\u2019t believe him. </p><p>\u201cso you were hoping you wouldn\u2019t get caught?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo! I didn\u2019t plan on this Peter!\u201d Peter shook his head.</p><p>\u201cyou\u2019re despicable! How could you hurt dad like this? He loved\nyou more than anything in the whole world! How could you?\u201d Peter was crying and\nSteve was crying and then Peter walked out. Steve put a hand on his mouth,\ntrying not to let the sounds of his sobbing escape. He couldn\u2019t believe this\nwas happening. Couldn\u2019t believe that he was losing them and he couldn\u2019t stop\nit. </p><hr><p>It got worse with each passing day, the arguing just got\nworse and worse. Tony and steve didn\u2019t mean to argue, but it just kept\nhappening. Steve had moved out into the guest bedroom and Tony found he could\nno longer fall asleep without Steve lying beside him. Peter kept coming home to\nonly hear Steve and Tony in the middle of a screaming match, he would simply\nsay he was staying at May\u2019s. then Peter was gone. Tony felt horrifically guilty\nfor this. Peter no longer felt comfortable being at home and Steve could barely\nstand to be in the same room as Tony. There was a knock at the door and when Tony\nwent to answer it was May standing in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cMay?\u201d Tony raised a brow but she was scowling.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk.\u201d With a sigh, Tony let her in.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he asked as he followed her into the\nkitchen.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to tell me why I\u2019ve got Peter staying at my\napartment every other night?\u201d May demanded and Tony sighed. </p><p>\u201cSteve and i\u2026\u201d Tony trailed off and May crossed her arms.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you and Steve? Because I\u2019ve got a seventeen year\nold kid showing up at my apartment every night, freaking out because his dads\ncan\u2019t pull their heads out of their asses! I gave Peter to you and Steve because\nI couldn\u2019t provide the life Peter deserved. So please explain to me what is\ngoing on.\u201d May was furious and she had every right to be. Tony twisted his\nwedding ring and took several deep and steadying breaths.</p><p>\u201cSteve cheated on me with Bucky.\u201d He watched as May\u2019s face\nsoftened and she gave him the look of pity.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry Tony.\u201d Her voice was soft and gentle, it made\ntony want to scream.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pity me. I\u2019ll be alright. But Steve and I are getting\na divorce, there\u2019s no point dragging it out. He wants to be with Bucky.\u201d Tony\ntwisted the ring again and May noticed.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d she asked and Tony squeezed his eyes\nshut.</p><p>\u201cSteve. That answer will always be Steve, but I have to do\nwhat\u2019s right by Steve and Peter. Steve wants Bucky and there\u2019s no point keeping\nSteve trapped in this marriage. It will only hurt everyone.\u201d May nodded.</p><p>\u201cSo why is it that Peter keeps coming over?\u201d she asked and Tony\nran a hand through his hair.</p><p>\u201cBecause Steve and I argue every night. We don\u2019t mean to,\nbut it just sort of happens. He said he\u2019ll move out some time next week.\u201d May nodded\nher head and Tony wanted to run and hide. </p><p>\u201cso who gets custody of Peter?\u201d May asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to share. It\u2019s only one year, there\u2019s no point\ngoing to court about who get\u2019s Peter.\u201d May nodded her head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry that you\u2019re going through this Tony.\u201d She whispered.</p><p>\u201cit is what it is.\u201d </p>",

That tony\u2019s life and his marriage was\nfalling apart, just as Clint and Natasha got to start their marriage. He knew\nSteeve had been shocked when Tony had given in so easily. But maybe Bucky was\nright, maybe Tony and Steve weren\u2019t meant to be together. But through all of\nthis, in the back of Tony\u2019s mind, he couldn\u2019t help but think, <i>this can\u2019t be over because I\u2019m still in love\nwith you</i>. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry Tony.\u201d Steve whispered and for once, he had\nthe look of love and adoration that Steve had always worn when looking at Tony.\nIt was only there for a second before he looked away. </p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to tell Peter?\u201d Tony asked softly, Steve\nsighed and shrugged.</p><p>\u201cHe already knows that I cheated, I\u2019m sure he already hates\nme, so I\u2019ll deliver the news.\u201d Tony shook his head.</p><p>\u201cno. I\u2019ll do it.\u201d Tony hated the idea of his kid finding out\nwithout him being there. Peter would need Tony through this, Tony wouldn\u2019t back\nout on his son now.</p><p>\u201cwe could do it together?\u201d Steve offered and Tony squeezed\nhis eyes shut. <i>together</i>. </p><p>\u201cokay.\u201d It seemed that Tony\u2019s brain was now on autopilot.\nAnything else was too much. </p><p>\u201cSteve?\u201d Tony asked suddenly and Steve looked back at him.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d his voice was flat, his face stone, his eyes cold. </p><p>\u201cWhere did it go wrong?\u201d Tony asked softly, he watched as an\nemotion floated to the surface of Steve\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Then steve walked out of the house and tony\nresisted the urge to break down into tears.</p><hr><p>The dinner was painfully awkward. Al had tried to ask about\nPeter\u2019s dads again and Peter had shut them down instantly. </p><p>\u201cthey\u2019re fine. Everything\u2019s fine. They\u2019ve just been working\nlots.\u201d Both Wade and May shot him strange looks.</p><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s good.\u201d Al then asked May a question and Peter\nallowed himself to zone out. He didn\u2019t want to be at home but he certainly\ndidn\u2019t want to be in the middle of a dinner with Wade. Peter wondered if it was\nstill too late to run. </p><p>\u201cIs the food okay?\u201d May asked and Peter forced himself to\nfocus on reality.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s delicious.\u201d May raised a brow at Peter\u2019s food,\nhe\u2019d barely touched it.</p><p>\u201cit is delicious May, thank you so much.\u201d Wade told her and\nshe smiled.</p><p>\u201c<i>Thank you Wade</i>.\u201d\nShe said while glaring at Peter.</p><p>\u201cit is delicious, now you boys run along, May and I have to\ncatch up privately now.\u201d Peter and Wade both rolled their eyes but stood,\nknowing it was better to follow Al\u2019s orders than to ignore them. Peter and Wade\ndumped their dishes into the kitchen sink. Wade opened his mouth but Peter just\nwalked out. He knew he was being an asshole, but he was allowing it for\ntonight. He just found out his pops had had an affair, his dads were probably\ngoing to break up and he hadn\u2019t slept for the past two days. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on Peter?\u201d Wade asked and Peter groaned.</p><p>\u201cWould you just leave me alone?\u201d Peter asked and flopped\nonto the bottom bunk in the guest bedroom. May called it the guest bedroom, but\nit was really Peter\u2019s room. Peter\u2019s head hit a bag and he swore, when he pulled\nback he noticed it was Wade\u2019s backpack.</p><p>\u201cwhy is your stuff here?\u201d Peter rubbed his forehead and Wade\nsuddenly looked sheepish.</p><p>\u201cMay\u2019s taking me in sort of.\u201d Wade looked down at his feet.</p><p>\u201cTaking you in?\u201d Peter asked.</p><p>\u201cAl asked her if I could stay here for the next six months\nand May agreed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix months?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix months is a big deal, what\u2019s going on?\u201d Peter asked and\nWade took a deep breath. He began fidgeting with the sleeve of his jacket and\nPeter knew to back down. He wasn\u2019t ready to say whatever was going on. </p><p>\u201cit\u2019s-\u201c but it was clear he didn\u2019t want to say it, so Peter\ninterrupted</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay Wade, you don\u2019t have to tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks Peter.\u201d The room was silent and then Wade sat down\non the bunk bed, Peter stared at the spot where his knee and Wade\u2019s touched.</p><p>\u201cstill obsessed with wham?\u201d Peter asked and he felt Wade\nrelax.</p><p>\u201cBest album of all time.\u201d Peter rolled his eyes, but it was\na relief. To know that even though everything in Peter\u2019s world was changing and\nreshuffling, Wade was still the same.</p><p>\u201cdebateable.\u201d Peter murmured and Wade bumped his shoulder\ninto Peter\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a dork.\u201d It felt good to be smiling with Wade\nagain. It felt good to simply be smiling.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you take the bottom bunk?\u201d Peter asked suddenly, and\nWade began to fidget with his jacket sleeve again.</p><p>\u201cA habit I guess.\u201d Wade shrugged but Peter couldn\u2019t help but\nsmile. When they were younger, Peter always took the top bunk. Whenever he had\nnightmares he would jump up and stick to the roof, at least he didn\u2019t wake up\nWade then. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for being such an asshole.\u201d Peter said softly and\nhe could feel Wade studying Peter\u2019s profile.</p><hr><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for being such an asshole.\u201d Wade lifted hid head\nand looked at Peter. He\u2019d forgotten how much he had missed Peter. How comforting\nit was to just be sitting beside him. Wade studied Peter\u2019s profile, taking not\nof how exhausted he looked. He wished Peter would open up, tell him what\u2019s\ngoing on. But things with Wade and Peter hadn\u2019t been easy and good like that,\nnot in a long time. Wade missed those days where he and Peter would just talk\nfor hours on end about anything and everything. </p><p>\u201cPeter\u2026\u201d but Wade trailed off, watching as if the world was\nin slow motion, as Peter looked at Wade.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Peter\u2019s big brown eyes were wide and studying Wade\u2019s\nface. Wade memorised Peter\u2019s face and hung his head.</p><p>\u201cwhy did we stop talking?\u201d Wade wondered, but he knew that\nanswer. </p><p>\u201cYou were popular and when push came to shove, you chose\nyour popular friends over me.\u201d Peter shrugged and Wade shook his head.</p><p>\u201cBut you were my best friend.\u201d He whispered, Peter didn\u2019t\nhear it.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve got Flash and I\u2019ve got Ned and we\u2019re both\nexactly where we\u2019re meant to be.\u201d Peter was now staring at the roof. Wade\nwanted to tell Peter that he missed him, missed their friendship. But the words\ndied in his throat. </p><p>\u201cYeah, exactly where we\u2019re meant to be.\u201d Wade echoed, not\nbelieving it.</p><hr><p>Steve wanted to scream, he tried to break the barriers in\nhis mind, but he was trapped. He couldn\u2019t tell tony the truth, he couldn\u2019t tell\nanyone the truth. He\u2019d tried talking to natasha and clint and bruce and any\navenger he could find, but the words died in his throat every time. He\u2019d tried\nto write it down, but his hand would just throw the pen across the room. He couldn\u2019t\ncommunicate this to anyone other than Bucky, who was just as trapped as Steve was.\n</p><p>\u201cDammit.\u201d Steve grunted as his hand suddenly spasmed, sending\nthe pen across the room.</p><p>\u201cPops?\u201d it was Peter\u2019s voice and Steve inhaled sharply.</p><p>\u201chey Peter.\u201d Steve forced himself to smile, but he couldn\u2019t\nmanage it.</p><p>\u201cCan I talk to you?\u201d Peter asked and Steve forced himself to\nnod.</p><p>\u201cof course, what\u2019s going on?\u201d Peter let out a deep sigh. </p><p>\u201cDad told me, about you and Bucky. I want to know, are you guys\ngetting a divorce?\u201d Peter asked and Steve felt his stomach twist and churn.</p><p>\u201cTony and I agreed we\u2019d have that conversation with you together.\u201d\nSteve told him gently.</p><p>\u201cI want to know now.\u201d Peter said firmly and Steve swallowed.\nHe twisted his wedding ring and took a deep shaky breath.</p><p>\u201cit wasn\u2019t an easy decision Peter.\u201d Steve murmured soflty.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re breaking up?\u201d Peter\u2019s voice was shaking and Steve\nsqueezed his eyes shut.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as simple as you think.\u201d Steve told him.</p><p>\u201cThen explain to me how complicated it is. How could you do\nthis?\u201d Peter demanded and Steve began shaking.</p><p>\u201cPeter-\u201c</p><p>\u201cTell me how you could ruin our family!\u201d Peter hissed and Steve\nfelt tears prick his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to ruin our family.\u201d Steve swore but he knew\nPeter didn\u2019t believe him. </p><p>\u201cso you were hoping you wouldn\u2019t get caught?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo! I didn\u2019t plan on this Peter!\u201d Peter shook his head.</p><p>\u201cyou\u2019re despicable! How could you hurt dad like this? He loved\nyou more than anything in the whole world! How could you?\u201d Peter was crying and\nSteve was crying and then Peter walked out. Steve put a hand on his mouth,\ntrying not to let the sounds of his sobbing escape. He couldn\u2019t believe this\nwas happening. Couldn\u2019t believe that he was losing them and he couldn\u2019t stop\nit. </p><hr><p>It got worse with each passing day, the arguing just got\nworse and worse. Tony and steve didn\u2019t mean to argue, but it just kept\nhappening. Steve had moved out into the guest bedroom and Tony found he could\nno longer fall asleep without Steve lying beside him. Peter kept coming home to\nonly hear Steve and Tony in the middle of a screaming match, he would simply\nsay he was staying at May\u2019s. then Peter was gone. Tony felt horrifically guilty\nfor this. Peter no longer felt comfortable being at home and Steve could barely\nstand to be in the same room as Tony. There was a knock at the door and when Tony\nwent to answer it was May standing in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cMay?\u201d Tony raised a brow but she was scowling.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk.\u201d With a sigh, Tony let her in.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he asked as he followed her into the\nkitchen.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to tell me why I\u2019ve got Peter staying at my\napartment every other night?\u201d May demanded and Tony sighed. </p><p>\u201cSteve and i\u2026\u201d Tony trailed off and May crossed her arms.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you and Steve? Because I\u2019ve got a seventeen year\nold kid showing up at my apartment every night, freaking out because his dads\ncan\u2019t pull their heads out of their asses! I gave Peter to you and Steve because\nI couldn\u2019t provide the life Peter deserved. So please explain to me what is\ngoing on.\u201d May was furious and she had every right to be. Tony twisted his\nwedding ring and took several deep and steadying breaths.</p><p>\u201cSteve cheated on me with Bucky.\u201d He watched as May\u2019s face\nsoftened and she gave him the look of pity.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry Tony.\u201d Her voice was soft and gentle, it made\ntony want to scream.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pity me. I\u2019ll be alright. But Steve and I are getting\na divorce, there\u2019s no point dragging it out. He wants to be with Bucky.\u201d Tony\ntwisted the ring again and May noticed.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d she asked and Tony squeezed his eyes\nshut.</p><p>\u201cSteve. That answer will always be Steve, but I have to do\nwhat\u2019s right by Steve and Peter. Steve wants Bucky and there\u2019s no point keeping\nSteve trapped in this marriage. It will only hurt everyone.\u201d May nodded.</p><p>\u201cSo why is it that Peter keeps coming over?\u201d she asked and Tony\nran a hand through his hair.</p><p>\u201cBecause Steve and I argue every night. We don\u2019t mean to,\nbut it just sort of happens. He said he\u2019ll move out some time next week.\u201d May nodded\nher head and Tony wanted to run and hide. </p><p>\u201cso who gets custody of Peter?\u201d May asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to share. It\u2019s only one year, there\u2019s no point\ngoing to court about who get\u2019s Peter.\u201d May nodded her head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry that you\u2019re going through this Tony.\u201d She whispered.</p><p>\u201cit is what it is.\u201d </p>",

That tony\u2019s life and his marriage was\nfalling apart, just as Clint and Natasha got to start their marriage. He knew\nSteeve had been shocked when Tony had given in so easily. But maybe Bucky was\nright, maybe Tony and Steve weren\u2019t meant to be together. But through all of\nthis, in the back of Tony\u2019s mind, he couldn\u2019t help but think, <i>this can\u2019t be over because I\u2019m still in love\nwith you</i>. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry Tony.\u201d Steve whispered and for once, he had\nthe look of love and adoration that Steve had always worn when looking at Tony.\nIt was only there for a second before he looked away. </p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to tell Peter?\u201d Tony asked softly, Steve\nsighed and shrugged.</p><p>\u201cHe already knows that I cheated, I\u2019m sure he already hates\nme, so I\u2019ll deliver the news.\u201d Tony shook his head.</p><p>\u201cno. I\u2019ll do it.\u201d Tony hated the idea of his kid finding out\nwithout him being there. Peter would need Tony through this, Tony wouldn\u2019t back\nout on his son now.</p><p>\u201cwe could do it together?\u201d Steve offered and Tony squeezed\nhis eyes shut. <i>together</i>. </p><p>\u201cokay.\u201d It seemed that Tony\u2019s brain was now on autopilot.\nAnything else was too much. </p><p>\u201cSteve?\u201d Tony asked suddenly and Steve looked back at him.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d his voice was flat, his face stone, his eyes cold. </p><p>\u201cWhere did it go wrong?\u201d Tony asked softly, he watched as an\nemotion floated to the surface of Steve\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Then steve walked out of the house and tony\nresisted the urge to break down into tears.</p><hr><p>The dinner was painfully awkward. Al had tried to ask about\nPeter\u2019s dads again and Peter had shut them down instantly. </p><p>\u201cthey\u2019re fine. Everything\u2019s fine. They\u2019ve just been working\nlots.\u201d Both Wade and May shot him strange looks.</p><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s good.\u201d Al then asked May a question and Peter\nallowed himself to zone out. He didn\u2019t want to be at home but he certainly\ndidn\u2019t want to be in the middle of a dinner with Wade. Peter wondered if it was\nstill too late to run. </p><p>\u201cIs the food okay?\u201d May asked and Peter forced himself to\nfocus on reality.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s delicious.\u201d May raised a brow at Peter\u2019s food,\nhe\u2019d barely touched it.</p><p>\u201cit is delicious May, thank you so much.\u201d Wade told her and\nshe smiled.</p><p>\u201c<i>Thank you Wade</i>.\u201d\nShe said while glaring at Peter.</p><p>\u201cit is delicious, now you boys run along, May and I have to\ncatch up privately now.\u201d Peter and Wade both rolled their eyes but stood,\nknowing it was better to follow Al\u2019s orders than to ignore them. Peter and Wade\ndumped their dishes into the kitchen sink. Wade opened his mouth but Peter just\nwalked out. He knew he was being an asshole, but he was allowing it for\ntonight. He just found out his pops had had an affair, his dads were probably\ngoing to break up and he hadn\u2019t slept for the past two days. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on Peter?\u201d Wade asked and Peter groaned.</p><p>\u201cWould you just leave me alone?\u201d Peter asked and flopped\nonto the bottom bunk in the guest bedroom. May called it the guest bedroom, but\nit was really Peter\u2019s room. Peter\u2019s head hit a bag and he swore, when he pulled\nback he noticed it was Wade\u2019s backpack.</p><p>\u201cwhy is your stuff here?\u201d Peter rubbed his forehead and Wade\nsuddenly looked sheepish.</p><p>\u201cMay\u2019s taking me in sort of.\u201d Wade looked down at his feet.</p><p>\u201cTaking you in?\u201d Peter asked.</p><p>\u201cAl asked her if I could stay here for the next six months\nand May agreed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix months?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix months is a big deal, what\u2019s going on?\u201d Peter asked and\nWade took a deep breath. He began fidgeting with the sleeve of his jacket and\nPeter knew to back down. He wasn\u2019t ready to say whatever was going on. </p><p>\u201cit\u2019s-\u201c but it was clear he didn\u2019t want to say it, so Peter\ninterrupted</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay Wade, you don\u2019t have to tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks Peter.\u201d The room was silent and then Wade sat down\non the bunk bed, Peter stared at the spot where his knee and Wade\u2019s touched.</p><p>\u201cstill obsessed with wham?\u201d Peter asked and he felt Wade\nrelax.</p><p>\u201cBest album of all time.\u201d Peter rolled his eyes, but it was\na relief. To know that even though everything in Peter\u2019s world was changing and\nreshuffling, Wade was still the same.</p><p>\u201cdebateable.\u201d Peter murmured and Wade bumped his shoulder\ninto Peter\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a dork.\u201d It felt good to be smiling with Wade\nagain. It felt good to simply be smiling.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you take the bottom bunk?\u201d Peter asked suddenly, and\nWade began to fidget with his jacket sleeve again.</p><p>\u201cA habit I guess.\u201d Wade shrugged but Peter couldn\u2019t help but\nsmile. When they were younger, Peter always took the top bunk. Whenever he had\nnightmares he would jump up and stick to the roof, at least he didn\u2019t wake up\nWade then. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for being such an asshole.\u201d Peter said softly and\nhe could feel Wade studying Peter\u2019s profile.</p><hr><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for being such an asshole.\u201d Wade lifted hid head\nand looked at Peter. He\u2019d forgotten how much he had missed Peter. How comforting\nit was to just be sitting beside him. Wade studied Peter\u2019s profile, taking not\nof how exhausted he looked. He wished Peter would open up, tell him what\u2019s\ngoing on. But things with Wade and Peter hadn\u2019t been easy and good like that,\nnot in a long time. Wade missed those days where he and Peter would just talk\nfor hours on end about anything and everything. </p><p>\u201cPeter\u2026\u201d but Wade trailed off, watching as if the world was\nin slow motion, as Peter looked at Wade.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Peter\u2019s big brown eyes were wide and studying Wade\u2019s\nface. Wade memorised Peter\u2019s face and hung his head.</p><p>\u201cwhy did we stop talking?\u201d Wade wondered, but he knew that\nanswer. </p><p>\u201cYou were popular and when push came to shove, you chose\nyour popular friends over me.\u201d Peter shrugged and Wade shook his head.</p><p>\u201cBut you were my best friend.\u201d He whispered, Peter didn\u2019t\nhear it.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve got Flash and I\u2019ve got Ned and we\u2019re both\nexactly where we\u2019re meant to be.\u201d Peter was now staring at the roof. Wade\nwanted to tell Peter that he missed him, missed their friendship. But the words\ndied in his throat. </p><p>\u201cYeah, exactly where we\u2019re meant to be.\u201d Wade echoed, not\nbelieving it.</p><hr><p>Steve wanted to scream, he tried to break the barriers in\nhis mind, but he was trapped. He couldn\u2019t tell tony the truth, he couldn\u2019t tell\nanyone the truth. He\u2019d tried talking to natasha and clint and bruce and any\navenger he could find, but the words died in his throat every time. He\u2019d tried\nto write it down, but his hand would just throw the pen across the room. He couldn\u2019t\ncommunicate this to anyone other than Bucky, who was just as trapped as Steve was.\n</p><p>\u201cDammit.\u201d Steve grunted as his hand suddenly spasmed, sending\nthe pen across the room.</p><p>\u201cPops?\u201d it was Peter\u2019s voice and Steve inhaled sharply.</p><p>\u201chey Peter.\u201d Steve forced himself to smile, but he couldn\u2019t\nmanage it.</p><p>\u201cCan I talk to you?\u201d Peter asked and Steve forced himself to\nnod.</p><p>\u201cof course, what\u2019s going on?\u201d Peter let out a deep sigh. </p><p>\u201cDad told me, about you and Bucky. I want to know, are you guys\ngetting a divorce?\u201d Peter asked and Steve felt his stomach twist and churn.</p><p>\u201cTony and I agreed we\u2019d have that conversation with you together.\u201d\nSteve told him gently.</p><p>\u201cI want to know now.\u201d Peter said firmly and Steve swallowed.\nHe twisted his wedding ring and took a deep shaky breath.</p><p>\u201cit wasn\u2019t an easy decision Peter.\u201d Steve murmured soflty.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re breaking up?\u201d Peter\u2019s voice was shaking and Steve\nsqueezed his eyes shut.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as simple as you think.\u201d Steve told him.</p><p>\u201cThen explain to me how complicated it is. How could you do\nthis?\u201d Peter demanded and Steve began shaking.</p><p>\u201cPeter-\u201c</p><p>\u201cTell me how you could ruin our family!\u201d Peter hissed and Steve\nfelt tears prick his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to ruin our family.\u201d Steve swore but he knew\nPeter didn\u2019t believe him. </p><p>\u201cso you were hoping you wouldn\u2019t get caught?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo! I didn\u2019t plan on this Peter!\u201d Peter shook his head.</p><p>\u201cyou\u2019re despicable! How could you hurt dad like this? He loved\nyou more than anything in the whole world! How could you?\u201d Peter was crying and\nSteve was crying and then Peter walked out. Steve put a hand on his mouth,\ntrying not to let the sounds of his sobbing escape. He couldn\u2019t believe this\nwas happening. Couldn\u2019t believe that he was losing them and he couldn\u2019t stop\nit. </p><hr><p>It got worse with each passing day, the arguing just got\nworse and worse. Tony and steve didn\u2019t mean to argue, but it just kept\nhappening. Steve had moved out into the guest bedroom and Tony found he could\nno longer fall asleep without Steve lying beside him. Peter kept coming home to\nonly hear Steve and Tony in the middle of a screaming match, he would simply\nsay he was staying at May\u2019s. then Peter was gone. Tony felt horrifically guilty\nfor this. Peter no longer felt comfortable being at home and Steve could barely\nstand to be in the same room as Tony. There was a knock at the door and when Tony\nwent to answer it was May standing in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cMay?\u201d Tony raised a brow but she was scowling.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk.\u201d With a sigh, Tony let her in.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he asked as he followed her into the\nkitchen.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to tell me why I\u2019ve got Peter staying at my\napartment every other night?\u201d May demanded and Tony sighed. </p><p>\u201cSteve and i\u2026\u201d Tony trailed off and May crossed her arms.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you and Steve? Because I\u2019ve got a seventeen year\nold kid showing up at my apartment every night, freaking out because his dads\ncan\u2019t pull their heads out of their asses! I gave Peter to you and Steve because\nI couldn\u2019t provide the life Peter deserved. So please explain to me what is\ngoing on.\u201d May was furious and she had every right to be. Tony twisted his\nwedding ring and took several deep and steadying breaths.</p><p>\u201cSteve cheated on me with Bucky.\u201d He watched as May\u2019s face\nsoftened and she gave him the look of pity.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry Tony.\u201d Her voice was soft and gentle, it made\ntony want to scream.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pity me. I\u2019ll be alright. But Steve and I are getting\na divorce, there\u2019s no point dragging it out. He wants to be with Bucky.\u201d Tony\ntwisted the ring again and May noticed.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d she asked and Tony squeezed his eyes\nshut.</p><p>\u201cSteve. That answer will always be Steve, but I have to do\nwhat\u2019s right by Steve and Peter. Steve wants Bucky and there\u2019s no point keeping\nSteve trapped in this marriage. It will only hurt everyone.\u201d May nodded.</p><p>\u201cSo why is it that Peter keeps coming over?\u201d she asked and Tony\nran a hand through his hair.</p><p>\u201cBecause Steve and I argue every night. We don\u2019t mean to,\nbut it just sort of happens. He said he\u2019ll move out some time next week.\u201d May nodded\nher head and Tony wanted to run and hide. </p><p>\u201cso who gets custody of Peter?\u201d May asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to share. It\u2019s only one year, there\u2019s no point\ngoing to court about who get\u2019s Peter.\u201d May nodded her head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry that you\u2019re going through this Tony.\u201d She whispered.</p><p>\u201cit is what it is.\u201d </p>",

Will this superfamily work out or will it all turn to hell?<br />A/N: so it&rsquo;s starting to look like i&rsquo;m going to get more free time this year which should (fingers crossed) hopefully mean i&rsquo;ll be able to update this fic more. also thanks for your patience, i&rsquo;m such a slow righter lol.&nbsp;<br /></p><p><a href=\"https://fandomfanfics12.tumblr.com/post/169767449338/we-are-a-family-part-1\">Part 1</a>, <a href=\"https://fandomfanfics12.tumblr.com/post/176056617463/we-are-a-family-part-2\">Part 2</a>, <a href=\"https://fandomfanfics12.tumblr.com/post/176691722833/we-are-a-family-part-3\">Part 3</a>, <a href=\"https://fandomfanfics12.tumblr.com/post/177191010848/we-are-a-family-part-4\">Part 4</a>, <a href=\"https://fandomfanfics12.tumblr.com/post/178431029093/we-are-a-family-part-5\">Part 5</a>, <a href=\"https://fandomfanfics12.tumblr.com/post/178497463383/we-are-a-family-part-6\">Part 6</a>, <a href=\"https://fandomfanfics12.tumblr.com/post/178628097553/we-are-a-family-part-7\">Part 7</a>, <a href=\"https://fandomfanfics12.tumblr.com/post/178809392058/we-are-a-family-8\">Part 8</a>, <a href=\"https://fandomfanfics12.tumblr.com/post/179274608238/we-are-a-family-part-9\">Part 9</a>, <a href=\"https://fandomfanfics12.tumblr.com/post/179450219763/we-are-a-family-part-10\">Part 10</a>, <a href=\"https://fandomfanfics12.tumblr.com/post/179502350203/we-are-a-family-part-11\">Part 11</a>, <a href=\"https://fandomfanfics12.tumblr.com/post/179569731063/we-are-a-family-part-12\">Part 12</a>, <a href=\"https://fandomfanfics12.tumblr.com/post/179587650108/we-are-a-family-part-13\">Part 13</a>, <a href=\"https://fandomfanfics12.tumblr.com/post/179709162168/we-are-a-family-part-14\">Part 14</a>, <a href=\"https://fandomfanfics12.tumblr.com/post/179775804688/we-are-a-family-part-15\">Part 15</a>, <a href=\"https://fandomfanfics12.tumblr.com/post/180132038938/we-are-a-family-part-16\">Part 16</a>, <a href=\"https://fandomfanfics12.tumblr.com/post/181671569423/we-are-a-family-part-17\">Part 17</a>, <a href=\"https://fandomfanfics12.tumblr.com/post/181798243798/we-are-a-family-part-18\">Part 18</a>, <a href=\"https://fandomfanfics12.tumblr.com/post/182867461693/we-are-a-family-part-19\">Part 19</a>, <a href=\"https://fandomfanfics12.tumblr.com/post/182867535498/we-are-a-family-part-20\">Part 20</a>, <a href=\"https://fandomfanfics12.tumblr.com/post/182867622998/we-are-a-family-part-21\">Part 21</a>, <a href=\"https://fandomfanfics12.tumblr.com/post/182999800873/we-are-a-family-part-22\">Part 22</a></p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>It was almost unfair. That tony&rsquo;s life and his marriage was\nfalling apart, just as Clint and Natasha got to start their marriage. He knew\nSteeve had been shocked when Tony had given in so easily. But maybe Bucky was\nright, maybe Tony and Steve weren&rsquo;t meant to be together. But through all of\nthis, in the back of Tony&rsquo;s mind, he couldn&rsquo;t help but think, <i>this can&rsquo;t be over because I&rsquo;m still in love\nwith you</i>. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry Tony.&rdquo; Steve whispered and for once, he had\nthe look of love and adoration that Steve had always worn when looking at Tony.\nIt was only there for a second before he looked away. </p><p>&ldquo;What are we going to tell Peter?&rdquo; Tony asked softly, Steve\nsighed and shrugged.</p><p>&ldquo;He already knows that I cheated, I&rsquo;m sure he already hates\nme, so I&rsquo;ll deliver the news.&rdquo; Tony shook his head.</p><p>&ldquo;no. I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo; Tony hated the idea of his kid finding out\nwithout him being there. Peter would need Tony through this, Tony wouldn&rsquo;t back\nout on his son now.</p><p>&ldquo;we could do it together?&rdquo; Steve offered and Tony squeezed\nhis eyes shut. <i>together</i>. </p><p>&ldquo;okay.&rdquo; It seemed that Tony&rsquo;s brain was now on autopilot.\nAnything else was too much. </p><p>&ldquo;Steve?&rdquo; Tony asked suddenly and Steve looked back at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; his voice was flat, his face stone, his eyes cold. </p><p>&ldquo;Where did it go wrong?&rdquo; Tony asked softly, he watched as an\nemotion floated to the surface of Steve&rsquo;s face.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Then steve walked out of the house and tony\nresisted the urge to break down into tears.</p><hr /><p>The dinner was painfully awkward. Al had tried to ask about\nPeter&rsquo;s dads again and Peter had shut them down instantly. </p><p>&ldquo;they&rsquo;re fine. Everything&rsquo;s fine. They&rsquo;ve just been working\nlots.&rdquo; Both Wade and May shot him strange looks.</p><p>&ldquo;Well that&rsquo;s good.&rdquo; Al then asked May a question and Peter\nallowed himself to zone out. He didn&rsquo;t want to be at home but he certainly\ndidn&rsquo;t want to be in the middle of a dinner with Wade. Peter wondered if it was\nstill too late to run. </p><p>&ldquo;Is the food okay?&rdquo; May asked and Peter forced himself to\nfocus on reality.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s delicious.&rdquo; May raised a brow at Peter&rsquo;s food,\nhe&rsquo;d barely touched it.</p><p>&ldquo;it is delicious May, thank you so much.&rdquo; Wade told her and\nshe smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Thank you Wade</i>.&rdquo;\nShe said while glaring at Peter.</p><p>&ldquo;it is delicious, now you boys run along, May and I have to\ncatch up privately now.&rdquo; Peter and Wade both rolled their eyes but stood,\nknowing it was better to follow Al&rsquo;s orders than to ignore them. Peter and Wade\ndumped their dishes into the kitchen sink. Wade opened his mouth but Peter just\nwalked out. He knew he was being an asshole, but he was allowing it for\ntonight. He just found out his pops had had an affair, his dads were probably\ngoing to break up and he hadn&rsquo;t slept for the past two days. </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on Peter?&rdquo; Wade asked and Peter groaned.</p><p>&ldquo;Would you just leave me alone?&rdquo; Peter asked and flopped\nonto the bottom bunk in the guest bedroom. May called it the guest bedroom, but\nit was really Peter&rsquo;s room. Peter&rsquo;s head hit a bag and he swore, when he pulled\nback he noticed it was Wade&rsquo;s backpack.</p><p>&ldquo;why is your stuff here?&rdquo; Peter rubbed his forehead and Wade\nsuddenly looked sheepish.</p><p>&ldquo;May&rsquo;s taking me in sort of.&rdquo; Wade looked down at his feet.</p><p>&ldquo;Taking you in?&rdquo; Peter asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Al asked her if I could stay here for the next six months\nand May agreed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Six months?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a big deal Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Six months is a big deal, what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; Peter asked and\nWade took a deep breath. He began fidgeting with the sleeve of his jacket and\nPeter knew to back down. He wasn&rsquo;t ready to say whatever was going on. </p><p>&ldquo;it&rsquo;s-&ldquo; but it was clear he didn&rsquo;t want to say it, so Peter\ninterrupted</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay Wade, you don&rsquo;t have to tell me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks Peter.&rdquo; The room was silent and then Wade sat down\non the bunk bed, Peter stared at the spot where his knee and Wade&rsquo;s touched.</p><p>&ldquo;still obsessed with wham?&rdquo; Peter asked and he felt Wade\nrelax.</p><p>&ldquo;Best album of all time.&rdquo; Peter rolled his eyes, but it was\na relief. To know that even though everything in Peter&rsquo;s world was changing and\nreshuffling, Wade was still the same.</p><p>&ldquo;debateable.&rdquo; Peter murmured and Wade bumped his shoulder\ninto Peter&rsquo;s.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re such a dork.&rdquo; It felt good to be smiling with Wade\nagain. It felt good to simply be smiling.</p><p>&ldquo;Why&rsquo;d you take the bottom bunk?&rdquo; Peter asked suddenly, and\nWade began to fidget with his jacket sleeve again.</p><p>&ldquo;A habit I guess.&rdquo; Wade shrugged but Peter couldn&rsquo;t help but\nsmile. When they were younger, Peter always took the top bunk. Whenever he had\nnightmares he would jump up and stick to the roof, at least he didn&rsquo;t wake up\nWade then. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for being such an asshole.&rdquo; Peter said softly and\nhe could feel Wade studying Peter&rsquo;s profile.</p><hr /><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for being such an asshole.&rdquo; Wade lifted hid head\nand looked at Peter. He&rsquo;d forgotten how much he had missed Peter. How comforting\nit was to just be sitting beside him. Wade studied Peter&rsquo;s profile, taking not\nof how exhausted he looked. He wished Peter would open up, tell him what&rsquo;s\ngoing on. But things with Wade and Peter hadn&rsquo;t been easy and good like that,\nnot in a long time. Wade missed those days where he and Peter would just talk\nfor hours on end about anything and everything. </p><p>&ldquo;Peter&hellip;&rdquo; but Wade trailed off, watching as if the world was\nin slow motion, as Peter looked at Wade.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s big brown eyes were wide and studying Wade&rsquo;s\nface. Wade memorised Peter&rsquo;s face and hung his head.</p><p>&ldquo;why did we stop talking?&rdquo; Wade wondered, but he knew that\nanswer. </p><p>&ldquo;You were popular and when push came to shove, you chose\nyour popular friends over me.&rdquo; Peter shrugged and Wade shook his head.</p><p>&ldquo;But you were my best friend.&rdquo; He whispered, Peter didn&rsquo;t\nhear it.</p><p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve got Flash and I&rsquo;ve got Ned and we&rsquo;re both\nexactly where we&rsquo;re meant to be.&rdquo; Peter was now staring at the roof. Wade\nwanted to tell Peter that he missed him, missed their friendship. But the words\ndied in his throat. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, exactly where we&rsquo;re meant to be.&rdquo; Wade echoed, not\nbelieving it.</p><hr /><p>Steve wanted to scream, he tried to break the barriers in\nhis mind, but he was trapped. He couldn&rsquo;t tell tony the truth, he couldn&rsquo;t tell\nanyone the truth. He&rsquo;d tried talking to natasha and clint and bruce and any\navenger he could find, but the words died in his throat every time. He&rsquo;d tried\nto write it down, but his hand would just throw the pen across the room. He couldn&rsquo;t\ncommunicate this to anyone other than Bucky, who was just as trapped as Steve was.\n</p><p>&ldquo;Dammit.&rdquo; Steve grunted as his hand suddenly spasmed, sending\nthe pen across the room.</p><p>&ldquo;Pops?&rdquo; it was Peter&rsquo;s voice and Steve inhaled sharply.</p><p>&ldquo;hey Peter.&rdquo; Steve forced himself to smile, but he couldn&rsquo;t\nmanage it.</p><p>&ldquo;Can I talk to you?&rdquo; Peter asked and Steve forced himself to\nnod.</p><p>&ldquo;of course, what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; Peter let out a deep sigh. </p><p>&ldquo;Dad told me, about you and Bucky. I want to know, are you guys\ngetting a divorce?&rdquo; Peter asked and Steve felt his stomach twist and churn.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony and I agreed we&rsquo;d have that conversation with you together.&rdquo;\nSteve told him gently.</p><p>&ldquo;I want to know now.&rdquo; Peter said firmly and Steve swallowed.\nHe twisted his wedding ring and took a deep shaky breath.</p><p>&ldquo;it wasn&rsquo;t an easy decision Peter.&rdquo; Steve murmured soflty.</p><p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re breaking up?&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s voice was shaking and Steve\nsqueezed his eyes shut.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not as simple as you think.&rdquo; Steve told him.</p><p>&ldquo;Then explain to me how complicated it is. How could you do\nthis?&rdquo; Peter demanded and Steve began shaking.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me how you could ruin our family!&rdquo; Peter hissed and Steve\nfelt tears prick his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to ruin our family.&rdquo; Steve swore but he knew\nPeter didn&rsquo;t believe him. </p><p>&ldquo;so you were hoping you wouldn&rsquo;t get caught?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No! I didn&rsquo;t plan on this Peter!&rdquo; Peter shook his head.</p><p>&ldquo;you&rsquo;re despicable! How could you hurt dad like this? He loved\nyou more than anything in the whole world! How could you?&rdquo; Peter was crying and\nSteve was crying and then Peter walked out. Steve put a hand on his mouth,\ntrying not to let the sounds of his sobbing escape. He couldn&rsquo;t believe this\nwas happening. Couldn&rsquo;t believe that he was losing them and he couldn&rsquo;t stop\nit. </p><hr /><p>It got worse with each passing day, the arguing just got\nworse and worse. Tony and steve didn&rsquo;t mean to argue, but it just kept\nhappening. Steve had moved out into the guest bedroom and Tony found he could\nno longer fall asleep without Steve lying beside him. Peter kept coming home to\nonly hear Steve and Tony in the middle of a screaming match, he would simply\nsay he was staying at May&rsquo;s. then Peter was gone. Tony felt horrifically guilty\nfor this. Peter no longer felt comfortable being at home and Steve could barely\nstand to be in the same room as Tony. There was a knock at the door and when Tony\nwent to answer it was May standing in the doorway.</p><p>&ldquo;May?&rdquo; Tony raised a brow but she was scowling.</p><p>&ldquo;We need to talk.&rdquo; With a sigh, Tony let her in.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; he asked as he followed her into the\nkitchen.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want to tell me why I&rsquo;ve got Peter staying at my\napartment every other night?&rdquo; May demanded and Tony sighed. </p><p>&ldquo;Steve and i&hellip;&rdquo; Tony trailed off and May crossed her arms.</p><p>&ldquo;What about you and Steve? Because I&rsquo;ve got a seventeen year\nold kid showing up at my apartment every night, freaking out because his dads\ncan&rsquo;t pull their heads out of their asses! I gave Peter to you and Steve because\nI couldn&rsquo;t provide the life Peter deserved. So please explain to me what is\ngoing on.&rdquo; May was furious and she had every right to be. Tony twisted his\nwedding ring and took several deep and steadying breaths.</p><p>&ldquo;Steve cheated on me with Bucky.&rdquo; He watched as May&rsquo;s face\nsoftened and she gave him the look of pity.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry Tony.&rdquo; Her voice was soft and gentle, it made\ntony want to scream.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pity me. I&rsquo;ll be alright. But Steve and I are getting\na divorce, there&rsquo;s no point dragging it out. He wants to be with Bucky.&rdquo; Tony\ntwisted the ring again and May noticed.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; she asked and Tony squeezed his eyes\nshut.</p><p>&ldquo;Steve. That answer will always be Steve, but I have to do\nwhat&rsquo;s right by Steve and Peter. Steve wants Bucky and there&rsquo;s no point keeping\nSteve trapped in this marriage. It will only hurt everyone.&rdquo; May nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;So why is it that Peter keeps coming over?&rdquo; she asked and Tony\nran a hand through his hair.</p><p>&ldquo;Because Steve and I argue every night. We don&rsquo;t mean to,\nbut it just sort of happens. He said he&rsquo;ll move out some time next week.&rdquo; May nodded\nher head and Tony wanted to run and hide. </p><p>&ldquo;so who gets custody of Peter?&rdquo; May asked.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to share. It&rsquo;s only one year, there&rsquo;s no point\ngoing to court about who get&rsquo;s Peter.&rdquo; May nodded her head.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry that you&rsquo;re going through this Tony.&rdquo; She whispered.</p><p>&ldquo;it is what it is.&rdquo; </p>",
