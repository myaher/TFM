        "body": "<h1>Best of Marvel: Week of April 10th, 2019</h1><p>Best of this Week: Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man #5 - Tom Taylor, Yildiray Cinar, Nolan Woodard and Travis Lanham</p><p>Spider-Man has always been a hero ruled by his emotions. From becoming a hero after failing to save his Uncle Ben, to giving up his costume out of frustration, to feeling so much sorrow that he gives up his marriage to save someone else&rsquo;s life.</p><p>Right now is another one of those pivotal moments as Peter and Aunt May sit across from each other, her having broke the news that she\u2019ll need to go through chemotherapy. Cinar absolutely nails the scene, showing the utter sadness in Peter\u2019s face and the ever present look of hopefulness of Aunt May, knowing that she can beat the cancer.</p><p>Peter of course, tells her that he can\u2019t make it to her first chemotherapy appointment and proceeds to run away from his problems, though he says otherwise. In his grief, he runs to clear his head and hears police sirens, alerting him to a chase in progress. He stops the chase and in anger, breaks the assailants wrist before recognizing him as a homeless kid that hangs nearby. The kid tells him that the only reason he stole the car was to get away from his mother\u2019s abusive boyfriend.</p><p>So Peter, relating to kid\u2019s need to get away, starts the car and proceeds to help him evade the cops. Tom Taylor really sells the idea that Spider-Man helps out those in his neighborhood. He didn\u2019t have to help this kid and there are always bigger threats to handle, but he cares about his city. Spider-Man can swing across the city and even lift cars, but in a cool - COOL move, uses his webs to fling the car into the sky, making the cops think it disappeared. He doesn\u2019t want to see this kid get hurt and knowing that he broke his wrist only makes him feel worse and he seeks the help of Doctor Strange.</p><p>Strange makes the homeless kid a cast and has a little talk with Spider-Man, noting his unusual recklessness. Peter unloads what he has on his mind and thinks about asking Strange to help her, but the good Doctor jokes about making deals with demons and says that sometimes things just have to run their natural course. The conversation does feel a little bit limp, especially after the emotional roller coasters that we\u2019ve had to go through in Hunted, but also appropriate for the feel of the book especially as Peter shows up to support Aunt May with coffee and trash magazines.</p><p>These final pages hit me with how much Peter loves and supports his Aunt for all of the love and support she&rsquo;s given him. He knows it would have broken her heart just a little if he had missed it and her smile upon seeing him almost made me cry.</p><p>There\u2019s something even further I want to dive into in regards to Aunt May and either direction this story can go. Do we need more of her? She\u2019s been around for almost 60 years acting as Peter\u2019s moral guide, support system and one of Marvel\u2019s most powerful characters since her creation. She\u2019s had many amazing storylines about her, around her and there are definitely many more that can be told. At the same time, because of One More Day, I\u2019ve questioned why she\u2019s lived this long. </p><p>One More Day is one of the more ludicrous, craptastic ways to prolong Peter\u2019s \u201cyouthfulness\u201d by having him give up his marriage to Mary Jane in a deal with Mephisto to save a dying Aunt May. Being married made the Peter seem more adult, more able to take care of himself, gave him a confidence that could have been better expanded on, but noooooooo. He had to get in his feelings and make a literal deal with the Devil to save a character that had already served her purpose in raising that boy.</p><p>I also think back to the emotional, powerful last moments of Spider-Man PS4, when Aunt May sacrificed herself so that New York could have the cure to Mr. Negative\u2019s plague. Not only did it give Peter another bar to reach, it gave closure to an absolutely wonderful character. It allows for new stories to be told about Peter or new people being able to take her place as Peter\u2019s guide with new, different perspectives.</p><p>I do think it\u2019s time to let Aunt May rest and be with Uncle Ben. Maybe let Peter have a little bit of closure with one less person to worry about as she goes peacefully. She\u2019s lost her husband, her charity foundation and now she\u2019s losing her health and it\u2019s time to stop hurting Aunt May. High recommend.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>Parting is such sweet sorrow.</p><p>Runner Up: Dead Man Logan #6 - Ed Brisson, Mike Henderson, Nolan Woodard and Cory Petit</p><p>Since 2015, a year after Logan 616\u2019s death, we&rsquo;ve had a multitude of Wolverines. X-23 took up the mantle for a few years, Jimmy Hudson made his way from the Ultimate Universe in X-Men Blue, heck, even Sabretooth filled in the role of Wolverine as the badass good guy who occasionally killed people for a while, but none have been as great as the Old Man Logan from Battleworld.</p><p>During Secret Wars, Old Man Logan was reintroduced as part of the Wasteland on Battleworld and fought his way out, eventually landing in the repaired 616 Universe. His initial arc focused on him trying to stop his future from happening, but between an Amadeus Cho Hulk and his own apparent death, he realized that things were different and he adjusted accordingly.</p><p>After many adventures involving saving his resurrected wife, Mariko, to joining a new Weapon X team alongside Sabretooth to defeating a POWERFUL Maestro twice, Old Man Logan has more than justified his existence in the world. However, with his failing healing factor and his longing to return to his world, Logan&rsquo;s been searching for a way back home and thanks to Maestro and some fixing from Forge, there&rsquo;s a time machine waiting for him.</p><p>This issue was just a bunch of goodbyes. He apologizes and says goodbye to one of the best men he knows in Steve Rogers, saying that he was blinded by his past with Mysterio when he attacked the Avengers a few issues ago, thinking they were villains. Steve forgives him and wishes him well. He says a final goodbye to Mariko, asking her to take care of the young kid that would be his wife some fifty years later.</p><p>The best one\u2026 THE BEST GOODBYE, is the one he makes to himself. I&rsquo;d wondered when or if it would actually happen, but Old Man Logan finally meets his younger, also resurrected self and they have a beer. In a heartfelt scene, Old Man Logan wonders if he should tell his younger self anything about the future. Logan surmises that it does, in fact, go terribly and Old Man Logan just tells him, \u201cNever stop fighting. Because the moment you put those claws away for good, that&rsquo;s when you lose everything that matters.\u201d a bar fight breaks out and the two decide to have a little fun, resulting in a BEAUTIFUL shot by Mike Henderson of both Wolverines with their claws popped.</p><p>The final goodbye is to the X-Men, of course. Jubilee, Glob and Forge and I think a few others and at this point I almost want to stop reading.</p><p>It&rsquo;s been a roller coaster of a ride with this character and there have been a thousand teases of him returning, but now it&rsquo;s real. Back to the hell of the Wasteland after what I can assume in Marvel Time has only been weeks or months for him. A world where Thor&rsquo;s hammer serves as a grim reminder that there&rsquo;s no hope as people futilely try to lift it, a world where people like Doctor Doom still live and force people to fight monsters in gladiator arenas, a world where, according to Old Man Quill, has a religion of nihilists ready to annihilate planets on a whim. </p><p>Welcome back to The Wasteland, Logan. Welcome back to hell.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1666\" data-orig-width=\"1080\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e3419e977cfedb1745802363c13e8832/tumblr_pptebvVmvv1snm78i_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1666\" data-orig-width=\"1080\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1659\" data-orig-width=\"1080\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/736271b8b59aae48e406b0a96c1db547/tumblr_pptebw475X1snm78i_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1659\" data-orig-width=\"1080\"/></figure>",

From becoming a hero after failing to save his Uncle Ben, to giving up his costume out of frustration, to feeling so much sorrow that he gives up his marriage to save someone else\u2019s life.</p><p>Right now is another one of those pivotal moments as Peter and Aunt May sit across from each other, her having broke the news that she\u2019ll need to go through chemotherapy. Cinar absolutely nails the scene, showing the utter sadness in Peter\u2019s face and the ever present look of hopefulness of Aunt May, knowing that she can beat the cancer.</p><p>Peter of course, tells her that he can\u2019t make it to her first chemotherapy appointment and proceeds to run away from his problems, though he says otherwise. In his grief, he runs to clear his head and hears police sirens, alerting him to a chase in progress. He stops the chase and in anger, breaks the assailants wrist before recognizing him as a homeless kid that hangs nearby. The kid tells him that the only reason he stole the car was to get away from his mother\u2019s abusive boyfriend.</p><p>So Peter, relating to kid\u2019s need to get away, starts the car and proceeds to help him evade the cops. Tom Taylor really sells the idea that Spider-Man helps out those in his neighborhood. He didn\u2019t have to help this kid and there are always bigger threats to handle, but he cares about his city. Spider-Man can swing across the city and even lift cars, but in a cool - COOL move, uses his webs to fling the car into the sky, making the cops think it disappeared. He doesn\u2019t want to see this kid get hurt and knowing that he broke his wrist only makes him feel worse and he seeks the help of Doctor Strange.</p><p>Strange makes the homeless kid a cast and has a little talk with Spider-Man, noting his unusual recklessness. Peter unloads what he has on his mind and thinks about asking Strange to help her, but the good Doctor jokes about making deals with demons and says that sometimes things just have to run their natural course. The conversation does feel a little bit limp, especially after the emotional roller coasters that we\u2019ve had to go through in Hunted, but also appropriate for the feel of the book especially as Peter shows up to support Aunt May with coffee and trash magazines.</p><p>These final pages hit me with how much Peter loves and supports his Aunt for all of the love and support she\u2019s given him. He knows it would have broken her heart just a little if he had missed it and her smile upon seeing him almost made me cry.</p><p>There\u2019s something even further I want to dive into in regards to Aunt May and either direction this story can go. Do we need more of her? She\u2019s been around for almost 60 years acting as Peter\u2019s moral guide, support system and one of Marvel\u2019s most powerful characters since her creation. She\u2019s had many amazing storylines about her, around her and there are definitely many more that can be told. At the same time, because of One More Day, I\u2019ve questioned why she\u2019s lived this long. </p><p>One More Day is one of the more ludicrous, craptastic ways to prolong Peter\u2019s \u201cyouthfulness\u201d by having him give up his marriage to Mary Jane in a deal with Mephisto to save a dying Aunt May. Being married made the Peter seem more adult, more able to take care of himself, gave him a confidence that could have been better expanded on, but noooooooo. He had to get in his feelings and make a literal deal with the Devil to save a character that had already served her purpose in raising that boy.</p><p>I also think back to the emotional, powerful last moments of Spider-Man PS4, when Aunt May sacrificed herself so that New York could have the cure to Mr. Negative\u2019s plague. Not only did it give Peter another bar to reach, it gave closure to an absolutely wonderful character. It allows for new stories to be told about Peter or new people being able to take her place as Peter\u2019s guide with new, different perspectives.</p><p>I do think it\u2019s time to let Aunt May rest and be with Uncle Ben. Maybe let Peter have a little bit of closure with one less person to worry about as she goes peacefully. She\u2019s lost her husband, her charity foundation and now she\u2019s losing her health and it\u2019s time to stop hurting Aunt May. High recommend.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Parting is such sweet sorrow.</p><p>Runner Up: Dead Man Logan #6 - Ed Brisson, Mike Henderson, Nolan Woodard and Cory Petit</p><p>Since 2015, a year after Logan 616\u2019s death, we\u2019ve had a multitude of Wolverines. X-23 took up the mantle for a few years, Jimmy Hudson made his way from the Ultimate Universe in X-Men Blue, heck, even Sabretooth filled in the role of Wolverine as the badass good guy who occasionally killed people for a while, but none have been as great as the Old Man Logan from Battleworld.</p><p>During Secret Wars, Old Man Logan was reintroduced as part of the Wasteland on Battleworld and fought his way out, eventually landing in the repaired 616 Universe. His initial arc focused on him trying to stop his future from happening, but between an Amadeus Cho Hulk and his own apparent death, he realized that things were different and he adjusted accordingly.</p><p>After many adventures involving saving his resurrected wife, Mariko, to joining a new Weapon X team alongside Sabretooth to defeating a POWERFUL Maestro twice, Old Man Logan has more than justified his existence in the world. However, with his failing healing factor and his longing to return to his world, Logan\u2019s been searching for a way back home and thanks to Maestro and some fixing from Forge, there\u2019s a time machine waiting for him.</p><p>This issue was just a bunch of goodbyes. He apologizes and says goodbye to one of the best men he knows in Steve Rogers, saying that he was blinded by his past with Mysterio when he attacked the Avengers a few issues ago, thinking they were villains. Steve forgives him and wishes him well. He says a final goodbye to Mariko, asking her to take care of the young kid that would be his wife some fifty years later.</p><p>The best one\u2026 THE BEST GOODBYE, is the one he makes to himself. I\u2019d wondered when or if it would actually happen, but Old Man Logan finally meets his younger, also resurrected self and they have a beer. In a heartfelt scene, Old Man Logan wonders if he should tell his younger self anything about the future. Logan surmises that it does, in fact, go terribly and Old Man Logan just tells him, \u201cNever stop fighting. Because the moment you put those claws away for good, that\u2019s when you lose everything that matters.\u201d a bar fight breaks out and the two decide to have a little fun, resulting in a BEAUTIFUL shot by Mike Henderson of both Wolverines with their claws popped.</p><p>The final goodbye is to the X-Men, of course. Jubilee, Glob and Forge and I think a few others and at this point I almost want to stop reading.</p><p>It\u2019s been a roller coaster of a ride with this character and there have been a thousand teases of him returning, but now it\u2019s real. Back to the hell of the Wasteland after what I can assume in Marvel Time has only been weeks or months for him. A world where Thor\u2019s hammer serves as a grim reminder that there\u2019s no hope as people futilely try to lift it, a world where people like Doctor Doom still live and force people to fight monsters in gladiator arenas, a world where, according to Old Man Quill, has a religion of nihilists ready to annihilate planets on a whim. </p><p>Welcome back to The Wasteland, Logan.
