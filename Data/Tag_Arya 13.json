The effects were noticeable. In Dany\u2019s company she laughed and smiled more than she had since she was a child. Her dreams were further evidence. How many times had she murdered Joffrey in the privacy of her mind? When Dany was with her, she dreamt of Dragons, Queens and Wolves, both living and dead, she dreamt of her family. When she woke with Dany pressed against her naked body, her revenge and her hate weren\u2019t the first things that crossed her mind. In those moments she allowed herself to think that maybe there could be a future for her that wasn\u2019t dominated by death.</i></p><p><i>Even now, aware that she would never get the chance to feel that goodness again, the hope remained. She knew what Dany thought of herself. She thought she was evil, the product of poisoned blood and madness. Every outburst reinforced Dany\u2019s poor self esteem, leading her to believe it was only a matter of time until she ended up like her father. Arya knew better. She\u2019d seen evil, she\u2019d experienced it and she knew that Dany wasn\u2019t. She had a temper sure, and she could react violently when she felt frustrated or threatened but that was a long walk from evil. She had wanted to be there when Dany realized she was nothing like the Targaryens who came before&hellip;</i></p><p>\u2014 <b>Just Dany</b> or <i>In Which Both My Girls Think They&rsquo;re Monsters And The Other Is The Sun And They Find Peace And Healing Together</i></p>",

I will watch more episodes whenever I get the\nchance, but right now I&rsquo;m having to work around 43 hours outside in the heat\nall day because about two of my co-workers quit and two others are on vacation\nfor a few days.
