She really wasn\u2019t playing fair. She\u2019d been doing so much better and then\u2026</p><p>Well, maybe he shouldn\u2019t have said shit about her Baba\u2019s apparent lack of strictness in parenting her, then. But even so, he\u2019d been at least a little right. Baba had been nothing but lenient with her though he\u2019d had a firm hand on T\u2019Challa. She\u2019d blame it on being the baby, the long awaited, much prayed for miracle that had come nearly a decade after her parents had married. She could probably blame it on how absolutely adorable she\u2019d been, too, or how precocious, or simply because her parents had wanted a princess so badly they could taste it.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t feel like blaming it anything at all except that she really needed to grow up and now. She was a mother, a wife, and had two little ones on the way. She couldn\u2019t keep picking fights with her husband just because she was bored. And the first step in being a grownup was admitting that she was wrong. So, she sought him out to apologize, after Thandi had FaceTimed Jude and washed up and was tucked away, sleeping soundly in bed.</p><p>She finds him on the back porch, the screen open so that the early March air could come floating in to the kitchen. There were still clouds from the storm earlier, and no stars shone through and no moon. In the distance, she could just barely see the dark tree line and the lone light that was Bruce\u2019s little cottage. Tony sat in the metal foldaway chair with a drink in one hand and his record player on the table beside him, and he hummed a bit under his breath, just a tad off key. For a second, she just stood in the doorway and watched him, took in the glimmer of silver in his dark hair, the lines on his face, the sensuality of his mouth. And she thought of how much she honestly loved this irascible, insufferable, annoying old man.</p><p><i>Bast</i>, she loved him. It only seemed to grow more and more pronounced the closer she got to May and the birth of the twins.</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna stand in the door all night, pretty baby?\u201d he asks, his voice low and soft, and she knows from the tone that he\u2019s not even close to being mad anymore. And that somehow makes her feel worse because he was always the one who caved first, who let go of his anger and conceded to her just to make things right.</p><p><i>I don\u2019t wanna argue, </i>he\u2019d said. <i>God only knows how much longer I\u2019ve got left.</i> But she\u2019d gone and argued with him anyway, because what did American doctors know? And what was a little heart trouble to Wakandan medicine? Fuck whatever T\u2019Challa said, she\u2019d drag him into her old lab no matter what it cost her if it would save him.</p><p><i>Her Tony</i>. She blinked back sorry, guilty tears at the thought of losing her Tony. But there was no use in worrying about that now. Worrying never solved anything. Shuri shook her head slightly to clear and moved out the doorway, wobbling a little in her slippers as the weight of her belly tilted her forward. She opened her mouth to say something, maybe an \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d for starters, but couldn\u2019t quite get it out. And he didn\u2019t turn to look at her just yet, his whiskey still in hand and his eyes still on the misty, dark sky.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you listening to?\u201d she asks, matching his tone and keeping her voice low lest she wake Thandi or ruin the fragile peace that had been laid between the two of them. Whatever is playing, it\u2019s something bluesy and upbeat and she watches as Tony\u2019s feet taps in time with the melody.</p><p>\u201cBobby Womack,\u201d he answers, and he clears his throat, takes a long swig. He waves her over toward him and she follows, catching his hand when he offers it and sliding into his lap with practiced ease. It\u2019s a little different now that she\u2019s so big and heavy but she manages, curling up against his chest like always. And the two of them don\u2019t speak for a long while as the song plays, the only noise besides the music the sound of trucks on the highway in the far distance and the subtle drip drop of rain water from the gutters.</p><p>In the sweet quiet that surrounds them, she bites the bullet and gathers her courage, pushes her pride far as she can and sucks in a deep breath before she finally just says it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmhm. Cause I am too.\u201d He tilts her head up to look at him and she feels her heart pitter patter in her chest at the love in his eyes. She really doesn\u2019t deserve him, she knows. But she\u2019ll take all the good from him she can get. \u201cI\u2019d say \u2018water under the bridge\u2019 but\u2026\u201d But they needed to talk about her mouth and his temper and vice versa, so no water under the bridge. And that was good. She really didn\u2019t want to just let that go. She wanted to work it out.</p><p>\u201cYeah. That was\u2026cruel of me.\u201d</p><p>Tony shrugs, as if it\u2019s nothing though she knows that had hurt him worse than anything she may have done in the last few months had. She wouldn\u2019t say years. She\u2019d spent the first few years she knew him hurting him in ways that made her so ashamed now she rarely ever thought about them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I mean, it\u2019s not alright, but it\u2019s okay. We\u2019ll talk about it later.\u201d He sighs and kisses her temple, his lips warm and gentle on her skin. \u201cJust sit here with me for a while, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He goes back to humming again, his feet picking up the beat of the song as if it\u2019d never stopped. His hands slide down her arm to her waist and hold her close, his fingers stroking her through the thin sweater she wore. The rhythm of his heartbeat and the warmth of his skin was enough that she figured she could go to sleep just like this, in his lap on the porch, except that he started to talk again and she found she wanted to listen. She loved his voice when it was deep and gritty and soaked with whiskey, and she smiled as the whiskers of his goatee brushed against her forehead.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmhm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and the kids could go back to Wakanda while I work on the add ons. Stay a few weeks, maybe a month or two. I know you miss home.\u201d</p><p>Shuri raised a brow and shifted a little in his lap. She did miss home and more than she thought she ever would, but Tony had been cagey about her going too far ever since that year away. She couldn\u2019t blame him, honestly. That had been really rotten of her to do. \u201cYou trust me enough to let me run off with your children like that?\u201d</p><p>Tony smiled, though there was a hint of sadness behind it that made her chest clench. \u201cI don\u2019t know, though I want to try to. I wanna say I do already, but\u2026you know, you could go home and decide you really don\u2019t like living on a farm with my old white ass anymore.\u201d</p><p>She snorts out a laugh and holds her belly as she does, rubbing the skin stretched taut like a balloon. \u201cOh, trust me, I wouldn\u2019t have married you if that were the case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Cause I\u2019m gonna need my very own nursemaid in about ten years or so-\u201c</p><p>\u201cStop it, no you won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIncontinence, memory loss, hell, I\u2019ve already got arthritis. I probably won\u2019t have any teeth either. You\u2019ll have to go get my medications and hearing aids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Anthony,\u201d she says, but there\u2019s no barb behind it. Her laugh softens to a smile and she reaches up to tug at his long hair. It\u2019s near to his shoulders now. He refuses to cut it, at least until Jude breaks down and finally wants to lop his off. Something about solidarity or whatever. The long hair was beautiful on him though. She really didn\u2019t mind at all.</p><p>\u201cAs you wish, princess,\u201d he says and he kisses her nose, then her lips, ever so slowly as if he\u2019s afraid she\u2019ll get angry at him for doing so. She hates that. She hates that she\u2019s hurt him so that he\u2019s still scared of being affectionate or holding her close without a split-second jerk reaction of running just in case.</p><p>Shuri decides, then and there, she won\u2019t give him a reason to ever again.</p><p>She sinks into the kiss with a satisfied sigh and drags her fingers through his hair, pulling his head down so he can map a trail of wet, open mouthed caresses down her neck and throat. She thinks maybe she\u2019s down for some makeup sex, especially with her hormones raring like they are, and almost tells him so, but the song in the background changes and Tony pauses, eyes opened and glancing up at his record player.</p><p>\u201cOh, fuck yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d She blinks in the dim porch light and then glances to her husband, who grins like a half-drunk cat. He probably <i>is</i> half drunk, she thinks, and she licks her lips, the taste of his Jim Beam lingering on her tongue.  </p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Kitten. Get up and dance with me.\u201d</p><p>Shuri makes a face and wiggles her feet. \u201cTony, I\u2019m big as a rhinoceros. You really think I could manage dancing like this?\u201d He nods and she can\u2019t help but chuckle. \u201cNo, seriously. I\u2019ll get up and tip over and you\u2019ll have to catch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really not that big, you know.\u201d He taps her hip and she groans, but swings her legs over the side. If he wants to dance, she\u2019ll at least attempt to. It\u2019s a slower song, thank goodness, so all she\u2019ll have to do is sway side to side until the song goes off. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s huge to you considering you\u2019re tiny by default, but nope, not too big.\u201d He smiles when she grunts and gets off his lap, her hand coming to her back so she doesn\u2019t lose her balance. \u201cAt least not to me.\u201d</p><p>Slow dancing with her belly in the way proves to be a bit of a challenge so Tony suggests that he hold her from the back and oddly enough, that works just fine. It\u2019s the same artist singing, the soul and blues coming through in the song so acutely it makes Shuri dizzy. And Tony keeps his movements smooth and easy, twirling her every once in a while for added measure, then pulling her right back into the warmth of his arms.  He kisses the shell of her ear and smooths his hands across her belly, then dips his head to kiss her jaw as he sings along.</p><p><i>\u201cYou&rsquo;re pushin&rsquo; my love a little bit too far\u2026I don&rsquo;t think you know, I don&rsquo;t think you know how blessed you are.\u201d</i></p><p>Shuri shoots him a glare when he twirls her again and doesn\u2019t miss the smirk on his mouth. \u201cAre you trying to send me a message?\u201d she asks him, when he\u2019s close by again and his laugh is rich, deep. It sparks a small flame in her that she knows if he stokes will be a raging wildfire in a few minutes time. Makeup sex is most definitely on the menu tonight.</p><p>\u201cMmm no. Just wanted to sing along. I love this song.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSerious.\u201d</p><p>She knows, by the way he laughs afterward, that he isn\u2019t. But she doesn\u2019t mind. Maybe she needs to be reminded.

She really wasn\u2019t playing fair. She\u2019d been doing so much better and then\u2026</p><p>Well, maybe he shouldn\u2019t have said shit about her Baba\u2019s apparent lack of strictness in parenting her, then. But even so, he\u2019d been at least a little right. Baba had been nothing but lenient with her though he\u2019d had a firm hand on T\u2019Challa. She\u2019d blame it on being the baby, the long awaited, much prayed for miracle that had come nearly a decade after her parents had married. She could probably blame it on how absolutely adorable she\u2019d been, too, or how precocious, or simply because her parents had wanted a princess so badly they could taste it.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t feel like blaming it anything at all except that she really needed to grow up and now. She was a mother, a wife, and had two little ones on the way. She couldn\u2019t keep picking fights with her husband just because she was bored. And the first step in being a grownup was admitting that she was wrong. So, she sought him out to apologize, after Thandi had FaceTimed Jude and washed up and was tucked away, sleeping soundly in bed.</p><p>She finds him on the back porch, the screen open so that the early March air could come floating in to the kitchen. There were still clouds from the storm earlier, and no stars shone through and no moon. In the distance, she could just barely see the dark tree line and the lone light that was Bruce\u2019s little cottage. Tony sat in the metal foldaway chair with a drink in one hand and his record player on the table beside him, and he hummed a bit under his breath, just a tad off key. For a second, she just stood in the doorway and watched him, took in the glimmer of silver in his dark hair, the lines on his face, the sensuality of his mouth. And she thought of how much she honestly loved this irascible, insufferable, annoying old man.</p><p><i>Bast</i>, she loved him. It only seemed to grow more and more pronounced the closer she got to May and the birth of the twins.</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna stand in the door all night, pretty baby?\u201d he asks, his voice low and soft, and she knows from the tone that he\u2019s not even close to being mad anymore. And that somehow makes her feel worse because he was always the one who caved first, who let go of his anger and conceded to her just to make things right.</p><p><i>I don\u2019t wanna argue, </i>he\u2019d said. <i>God only knows how much longer I\u2019ve got left.</i> But she\u2019d gone and argued with him anyway, because what did American doctors know? And what was a little heart trouble to Wakandan medicine? Fuck whatever T\u2019Challa said, she\u2019d drag him into her old lab no matter what it cost her if it would save him.</p><p><i>Her Tony</i>. She blinked back sorry, guilty tears at the thought of losing her Tony. But there was no use in worrying about that now. Worrying never solved anything. Shuri shook her head slightly to clear and moved out the doorway, wobbling a little in her slippers as the weight of her belly tilted her forward. She opened her mouth to say something, maybe an \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d for starters, but couldn\u2019t quite get it out. And he didn\u2019t turn to look at her just yet, his whiskey still in hand and his eyes still on the misty, dark sky.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you listening to?\u201d she asks, matching his tone and keeping her voice low lest she wake Thandi or ruin the fragile peace that had been laid between the two of them. Whatever is playing, it\u2019s something bluesy and upbeat and she watches as Tony\u2019s feet taps in time with the melody.</p><p>\u201cBobby Womack,\u201d he answers, and he clears his throat, takes a long swig. He waves her over toward him and she follows, catching his hand when he offers it and sliding into his lap with practiced ease. It\u2019s a little different now that she\u2019s so big and heavy but she manages, curling up against his chest like always. And the two of them don\u2019t speak for a long while as the song plays, the only noise besides the music the sound of trucks on the highway in the far distance and the subtle drip drop of rain water from the gutters.</p><p>In the sweet quiet that surrounds them, she bites the bullet and gathers her courage, pushes her pride far as she can and sucks in a deep breath before she finally just says it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmhm. Cause I am too.\u201d He tilts her head up to look at him and she feels her heart pitter patter in her chest at the love in his eyes. She really doesn\u2019t deserve him, she knows. But she\u2019ll take all the good from him she can get. \u201cI\u2019d say \u2018water under the bridge\u2019 but\u2026\u201d But they needed to talk about her mouth and his temper and vice versa, so no water under the bridge. And that was good. She really didn\u2019t want to just let that go. She wanted to work it out.</p><p>\u201cYeah. That was\u2026cruel of me.\u201d</p><p>Tony shrugs, as if it\u2019s nothing though she knows that had hurt him worse than anything she may have done in the last few months had. She wouldn\u2019t say years. She\u2019d spent the first few years she knew him hurting him in ways that made her so ashamed now she rarely ever thought about them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I mean, it\u2019s not alright, but it\u2019s okay.

His hands slide down her arm to her waist and hold her close, his fingers stroking her through the thin sweater she wore. The rhythm of his heartbeat and the warmth of his skin was enough that she figured she could go to sleep just like this, in his lap on the porch, except that he started to talk again and she found she wanted to listen.

She really wasn\u2019t playing fair. She\u2019d been doing so much better and then\u2026</p><p>Well, maybe he shouldn\u2019t have said shit about her Baba\u2019s apparent lack of strictness in parenting her, then. But even so, he\u2019d been at least a little right. Baba had been nothing but lenient with her though he\u2019d had a firm hand on T\u2019Challa. She\u2019d blame it on being the baby, the long awaited, much prayed for miracle that had come nearly a decade after her parents had married. She could probably blame it on how absolutely adorable she\u2019d been, too, or how precocious, or simply because her parents had wanted a princess so badly they could taste it.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t feel like blaming it anything at all except that she really needed to grow up and now. She was a mother, a wife, and had two little ones on the way. She couldn\u2019t keep picking fights with her husband just because she was bored. And the first step in being a grownup was admitting that she was wrong. So, she sought him out to apologize, after Thandi had FaceTimed Jude and washed up and was tucked away, sleeping soundly in bed.</p><p>She finds him on the back porch, the screen open so that the early March air could come floating in to the kitchen. There were still clouds from the storm earlier, and no stars shone through and no moon. In the distance, she could just barely see the dark tree line and the lone light that was Bruce\u2019s little cottage. Tony sat in the metal foldaway chair with a drink in one hand and his record player on the table beside him, and he hummed a bit under his breath, just a tad off key. For a second, she just stood in the doorway and watched him, took in the glimmer of silver in his dark hair, the lines on his face, the sensuality of his mouth. And she thought of how much she honestly loved this irascible, insufferable, annoying old man.</p><p><i>Bast</i>, she loved him. It only seemed to grow more and more pronounced the closer she got to May and the birth of the twins.</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna stand in the door all night, pretty baby?\u201d he asks, his voice low and soft, and she knows from the tone that he\u2019s not even close to being mad anymore. And that somehow makes her feel worse because he was always the one who caved first, who let go of his anger and conceded to her just to make things right.</p><p><i>I don\u2019t wanna argue, </i>he\u2019d said. <i>God only knows how much longer I\u2019ve got left.</i> But she\u2019d gone and argued with him anyway, because what did American doctors know? And what was a little heart trouble to Wakandan medicine? Fuck whatever T\u2019Challa said, she\u2019d drag him into her old lab no matter what it cost her if it would save him.</p><p><i>Her Tony</i>. She blinked back sorry, guilty tears at the thought of losing her Tony. But there was no use in worrying about that now. Worrying never solved anything. Shuri shook her head slightly to clear and moved out the doorway, wobbling a little in her slippers as the weight of her belly tilted her forward. She opened her mouth to say something, maybe an \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d for starters, but couldn\u2019t quite get it out. And he didn\u2019t turn to look at her just yet, his whiskey still in hand and his eyes still on the misty, dark sky.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you listening to?\u201d she asks, matching his tone and keeping her voice low lest she wake Thandi or ruin the fragile peace that had been laid between the two of them. Whatever is playing, it\u2019s something bluesy and upbeat and she watches as Tony\u2019s feet taps in time with the melody.</p><p>\u201cBobby Womack,\u201d he answers, and he clears his throat, takes a long swig. He waves her over toward him and she follows, catching his hand when he offers it and sliding into his lap with practiced ease. It\u2019s a little different now that she\u2019s so big and heavy but she manages, curling up against his chest like always. And the two of them don\u2019t speak for a long while as the song plays, the only noise besides the music the sound of trucks on the highway in the far distance and the subtle drip drop of rain water from the gutters.</p><p>In the sweet quiet that surrounds them, she bites the bullet and gathers her courage, pushes her pride far as she can and sucks in a deep breath before she finally just says it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmhm. Cause I am too.\u201d He tilts her head up to look at him and she feels her heart pitter patter in her chest at the love in his eyes. She really doesn\u2019t deserve him, she knows. But she\u2019ll take all the good from him she can get. \u201cI\u2019d say \u2018water under the bridge\u2019 but\u2026\u201d But they needed to talk about her mouth and his temper and vice versa, so no water under the bridge. And that was good. She really didn\u2019t want to just let that go. She wanted to work it out.</p><p>\u201cYeah. That was\u2026cruel of me.\u201d</p><p>Tony shrugs, as if it\u2019s nothing though she knows that had hurt him worse than anything she may have done in the last few months had. She wouldn\u2019t say years. She\u2019d spent the first few years she knew him hurting him in ways that made her so ashamed now she rarely ever thought about them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I mean, it\u2019s not alright, but it\u2019s okay. We\u2019ll talk about it later.\u201d He sighs and kisses her temple, his lips warm and gentle on her skin. \u201cJust sit here with me for a while, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He goes back to humming again, his feet picking up the beat of the song as if it\u2019d never stopped. His hands slide down her arm to her waist and hold her close, his fingers stroking her through the thin sweater she wore. The rhythm of his heartbeat and the warmth of his skin was enough that she figured she could go to sleep just like this, in his lap on the porch, except that he started to talk again and she found she wanted to listen. She loved his voice when it was deep and gritty and soaked with whiskey, and she smiled as the whiskers of his goatee brushed against her forehead.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmhm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and the kids could go back to Wakanda while I work on the add ons. Stay a few weeks, maybe a month or two. I know you miss home.\u201d</p><p>Shuri raised a brow and shifted a little in his lap. She did miss home and more than she thought she ever would, but Tony had been cagey about her going too far ever since that year away. She couldn\u2019t blame him, honestly. That had been really rotten of her to do. \u201cYou trust me enough to let me run off with your children like that?\u201d</p><p>Tony smiled, though there was a hint of sadness behind it that made her chest clench. \u201cI don\u2019t know, though I want to try to. I wanna say I do already, but\u2026you know, you could go home and decide you really don\u2019t like living on a farm with my old white ass anymore.\u201d</p><p>She snorts out a laugh and holds her belly as she does, rubbing the skin stretched taut like a balloon. \u201cOh, trust me, I wouldn\u2019t have married you if that were the case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Cause I\u2019m gonna need my very own nursemaid in about ten years or so-\u201c</p><p>\u201cStop it, no you won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIncontinence, memory loss, hell, I\u2019ve already got arthritis. I probably won\u2019t have any teeth either. You\u2019ll have to go get my medications and hearing aids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Anthony,\u201d she says, but there\u2019s no barb behind it. Her laugh softens to a smile and she reaches up to tug at his long hair. It\u2019s near to his shoulders now. He refuses to cut it, at least until Jude breaks down and finally wants to lop his off. Something about solidarity or whatever. The long hair was beautiful on him though. She really didn\u2019t mind at all.</p><p>\u201cAs you wish, princess,\u201d he says and he kisses her nose, then her lips, ever so slowly as if he\u2019s afraid she\u2019ll get angry at him for doing so. She hates that. She hates that she\u2019s hurt him so that he\u2019s still scared of being affectionate or holding her close without a split-second jerk reaction of running just in case.</p><p>Shuri decides, then and there, she won\u2019t give him a reason to ever again.</p><p>She sinks into the kiss with a satisfied sigh and drags her fingers through his hair, pulling his head down so he can map a trail of wet, open mouthed caresses down her neck and throat. She thinks maybe she\u2019s down for some makeup sex, especially with her hormones raring like they are, and almost tells him so, but the song in the background changes and Tony pauses, eyes opened and glancing up at his record player.</p><p>\u201cOh, fuck yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d She blinks in the dim porch light and then glances to her husband, who grins like a half-drunk cat. He probably <i>is</i> half drunk, she thinks, and she licks her lips, the taste of his Jim Beam lingering on her tongue.  </p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Kitten. Get up and dance with me.\u201d</p><p>Shuri makes a face and wiggles her feet. \u201cTony, I\u2019m big as a rhinoceros. You really think I could manage dancing like this?\u201d He nods and she can\u2019t help but chuckle. \u201cNo, seriously. I\u2019ll get up and tip over and you\u2019ll have to catch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really not that big, you know.\u201d He taps her hip and she groans, but swings her legs over the side. If he wants to dance, she\u2019ll at least attempt to. It\u2019s a slower song, thank goodness, so all she\u2019ll have to do is sway side to side until the song goes off. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s huge to you considering you\u2019re tiny by default, but nope, not too big.\u201d He smiles when she grunts and gets off his lap, her hand coming to her back so she doesn\u2019t lose her balance. \u201cAt least not to me.\u201d</p><p>Slow dancing with her belly in the way proves to be a bit of a challenge so Tony suggests that he hold her from the back and oddly enough, that works just fine. It\u2019s the same artist singing, the soul and blues coming through in the song so acutely it makes Shuri dizzy. And Tony keeps his movements smooth and easy, twirling her every once in a while for added measure, then pulling her right back into the warmth of his arms.  He kisses the shell of her ear and smooths his hands across her belly, then dips his head to kiss her jaw as he sings along.</p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re pushin\u2019 my love a little bit too far\u2026I don\u2019t think you know, I don\u2019t think you know how blessed you are.\u201d</i></p><p>Shuri shoots him a glare when he twirls her again and doesn\u2019t miss the smirk on his mouth. \u201cAre you trying to send me a message?\u201d she asks him, when he\u2019s close by again and his laugh is rich, deep. It sparks a small flame in her that she knows if he stokes will be a raging wildfire in a few minutes time. Makeup sex is most definitely on the menu tonight.</p><p>\u201cMmm no. Just wanted to sing along. I love this song.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSerious.\u201d</p><p>She knows, by the way he laughs afterward, that he isn\u2019t. But she doesn\u2019t mind. Maybe she needs to be reminded. Shuri threads her fingers through his and ignores the swell in her ankles and the ache in her back and slow dances on the porch with her Tony as the clouds clear and the stars sparkle brightly in the night sky.</p></p>",
