        "body": "<p>The last twelve days have been somewhat a blur.\u00a0 The Neo Clan has moved into a nice house close to the Police station and have started their patrols.\u00a0 Hyuna and the \u201cDolls\u201d have left to get settled into their new positions in Daegu but plan to return for the weddings.\u00a0 The Kim Manor has begun the transition to school.\u00a0 The Kims and Jungs have moved into the Kim manor.\u00a0 And all of the Min siblings have settled into suites throughout the compound.\u00a0 The Elementals, The Alcolytes, and the witch orphans have left to start the magic academy outside of Busan.\u00a0 N has taken over the role of CEO of all of the Min and Park holdings in Busan.\u00a0 They all plan on returning to the compound for the weddings.</p><p>\t\u201cWe are never going to find the right book in this library.\u00a0 We have spent the last ten days looking through all of these books and haven\u2019t found anything yet.\u00a0 Maybe we should ask Aurora for help?\u201d\u00a0 Bobby tells CL while piling another book onto the stack in front of him.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYeah, maybe you are right.\u00a0 Aurora might know a spell to find the correct book.\u00a0 Or maybe Yoongi will know what book we need to look in.\u00a0 I need to call Namjoon to see if the DNA tests are done yet.\u00a0 That might help us know a bit more also.\u00a0 Don\u2019t worry, babe, we will find out what my father and Kai were talking about.\u00a0 But even if we don\u2019t, I will love you any ways.\u201d\u00a0 CL says as she kisses his cheek and takes out her phone.</p><p>\t\u201cWhile you are calling Namjoon, I am going to go see if I can find Aurora and Yoongi.\u00a0 Be back in a few, babe.\u201d\u00a0 Bobby says as he kisses her forehead.\u00a0 CL nods.</p><p>\t\u201cHey, Namjoon, it\u2019s CL.\u00a0 How have you been?\u00a0 I called to see if you have Bobby\u2019s DNA test done yet.\u00a0 I know you are busy but he really wants to know who he is before the wedding next week.\u201d\u00a0 CL tells him.</p><p>\t\u201cHey, CL.\u00a0 Jin and I doing well.\u00a0 We have been busy on converting the manor.\u00a0 I have his results and they are quite surprising.\u00a0 Jin and I will be by this evening for dinner; I will bring them then.\u201d\u00a0 Namjoon answers.</p><p>\t\u201cOkay.\u00a0 Thanks.\u00a0 See you both tonight.\u00a0 Bye.\u201d\u00a0 CL replies.</p><p>\t\u201cSee you tonight.\u00a0 Bye.\u201d\u00a0 Namjoon says as he hangs up.</p><p>\tMeanwhile, Bobby asks the head housekeeper, \u201cHave you seen Master Min or Lady Aurora around the compound?\u201d</p><p>\tShe stops dusting and replies with a smile, \u201cMaster Min is having a meeting at city hall and Lady Aurora is helping King Taehyung and Lord Jimin take all of the younger pups and the smaller children to the park to play.\u00a0 They are both set to return around 5pm before the dinner party, Master Bobby.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPlease just call me, Bobby.\u00a0 And thank you for your time.\u201d\u00a0 He says as he looks at his feet.</p><p>\t\u201cOh no, sir, I can\u2019t call you that.\u00a0 You are the future husband of Lady CL.\u00a0 It is not allowed.\u00a0 And you are welcome, Master.\u00a0 If I may be forward, you remind me a lot of a young prince who would visit the compound to play with Master Jungkook.\u00a0 But his name was Prince Ji-Won.\u00a0 His mother was the sister of Elder Kim and his father was the Late Prince of the Moon, Prince Joohyun.\u00a0 Prince Joohyun and his wife perished in a mysterious fire and it has long since been assumed that Prince Ji-Won was lost as well.\u00a0 But seeing you before me, I am not completely sure.\u00a0 Your eyes are like his were; kind, warm, loving, and full of life.\u201d\u00a0 She says with a warm smile.</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t know who I am really.\u00a0 Hyuna found me wandering the streets when I was young.\u00a0 I think I was seven or eight and I couldn\u2019t remember anything.\u00a0 That is why I needed Aurora and Yoongi.\u00a0 I was hoping they could help me figure it out.\u201d\u00a0 He says with a smile.\u00a0 \u201cI will let you get back to work.\u00a0 Sorry for bothering you and thank you for the information.\u201d\u00a0 He continues as he turns to return to the library.</p><p>\t\u201cNot a problem, young Master Bobby.\u00a0 I am sure you will know who you are soon enough.\u00a0 Nothing stays a secret for forever. \u00a0 And you are very welcome.\u201d\u00a0 She says as she returns to her dusting. \u00a0</p><p>\tHe ponders the information that he was just presented with.\u00a0 While he was lost in thought, he nearly tripped over a toy car that one of the children had left out.\u00a0 Still lost in thought as he enters the library; he doesn\u2019t realize that CL was talking to him.\u00a0 He snaps back to reality when CL touches his hand.\u00a0 He jumps slightly and says, \u201cWhat?\u00a0 I am sorry.\u00a0 What did Namjoon say?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cAre you okay?\u00a0 You seem a bit distracted.\u00a0 Sorry about scaring you.\u00a0 Namjoon said he will bring the results to the dinner tonight.\u201d\u00a0 CL says while she looks deep into his eyes. \u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI am fine; I guess.\u00a0 I asked a maid where Yoongi and Aurora was.\u00a0 She told me that they were out and would be back later.\u00a0 But before I walked away, she told me that I reminded her of a little boy who used to play with Jungkook.\u00a0 His name was Prince Ji-Won.\u00a0 She said something about his father was Prince of the Moon and that Elder Kim\u2019s sister was his mother.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know what to think.\u00a0 Do I get my hopes up or do I wait until Namjoon comes with the test results?\u201d\u00a0 Bobby says as he runs his hands through his hair and looks teary eyed at CL. \u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI think we need to take a break from his for now and go take a nap.\u00a0 You need some rest.\u00a0 Let\u2019s wait to see what Namjoon reveals tonight before we start searching for anything about your father, mother, and yourself.\u00a0 I love you.\u00a0 And I would love you whether you are a prince or you are a homeless lost soul from the streets.\u00a0 It is the man you are now that matters the most to me.\u201d\u00a0 CL responds with a loving smile and an outstretched hand.</p><p>\tHe takes her hand and allows her to lead him to their room.\u00a0 \u201cI Love You, babe.\u201d\u00a0 Bobby says as he follows behind.\u00a0 She walks him to the bed and lays him back.\u00a0 She climbs onto the bed and lays her head onto his chest; feeling the way his chest rises and falls and his heart beats like a marching cadence.\u00a0 Silently, they drift off to sleep.</p><p>\tCL wakes up to find the maid taking Soojin to the adjoining suite to play.\u00a0 She gets up and wakes Bobby, \u201cBobby, baby, time to wake up.\u00a0 Guests will be arriving soon.\u00a0 I am going to go bathe Soojin and get her ready and then I am going to take a shower.\u201d\u00a0 He lifts his head but rolls back over with a mumble.\u00a0 \u201cFine.\u00a0 I will let you sleep until I am done with my shower but after that you had better get up.\u00a0 Don\u2019t forget what I did the other day without meaning to.\u00a0 That poor dog\u2019s hair may never grow back.\u00a0 And I wasn\u2019t annoyed by it.\u00a0 It was a complete accident.\u201d\u00a0 She reminds him with a giggle.\u00a0 She goes to the other room and asks the maid, \u201cCan you make sure that Bobby\u2019s suit is laid out and my Lavender Cocktail dress is ready?\u201d\u00a0 The maid bows and hands her Soojin.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHi, babygirl.\u00a0 Did you have fun today with the other kids?\u00a0 Okay time for a bath and then big family dinner.\u201d\u00a0 CL says softly to her daughter.\u00a0 She takes her to the bath and bathes her.\u00a0 Soojin doesn\u2019t mind the water until CL washes her hair then Soojin screams at the top of her lungs and CL would swear that she has banshee in her if she didn\u2019t know better.\u00a0 \u201cDid you have fun?\u00a0 Mommy got soaked.\u00a0 Let\u2019s get you dressed and then we can go wake up daddy.\u201d\u00a0 CL tells the young girl.\u00a0 CL dries the baby and dresses her in a cute little black and red dress, white stockings, shiny black dress shoes and a ruffled diaper cover.\u00a0 CL brushes Soojin\u2019s hair into two tiny little pig tails and ties them with red ribbon.\u00a0 \u201cOkay lets go wake daddy.\u201d\u00a0 CL says and Soojin responds with a giggle.</p><p>\t\u201cDaddy, wake up.\u00a0 Your babygirl wants to see you.\u201d\u00a0 CL says as she puts Soojin on the bed and lets her crawl on top of Bobby.\u00a0 He opens his eyes and smiles.</p><p>\t\u201cHow is daddy\u2019s babygirl?\u00a0 You look so pretty.\u00a0 I guess it is just me and you until mommy gets done getting ready.\u00a0 Would you like me to play with you?\u201d\u00a0 Bobby inquires from his daughter.\u00a0 She smiles and giggles.\u00a0 He picks her up and takes her to her room.\u00a0 On the way, Bobby hugs CL around the waist and kisses her cheek.\u00a0 \u201cI Love you.\u00a0 And our daughter.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 That was one of the best wake up calls I have ever had.\u201d\u00a0 Bobby says before going to Soojin\u2019s room.\u00a0 CL smiles and goes to the bathroom to shower.\u00a0 She quickly showers and gets ready then goes to play with Soojin while Bobby bathes and gets changed.\u00a0 When he emerges from the bathroom, he goes to Soojin\u2019s room.\u00a0 \u201cOkay ladies, are we ready to go meet guests?\u00a0 And hopefully find out who I am.\u201d\u00a0 He says but with the last part said under his breath.\u00a0 They leave to head to the dining room.</p><p>\tThey enter the dining room and Yoongi and Aurora greeting all of the guests.\u00a0 The Min family, as well as the Jungs, Kims, and the Neo clan are all present.\u00a0 All are seated around a very large dining table and the maids have taken the children to the next room to feed them at their own table. \u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAs we all know, next week will begin a new chapter for the Min family.\u00a0 With that being said, there are a few things that need to be clarified.\u00a0 I had Namjoon run some basic DNA tests to clarify true lineage of all of the Mins and their future and current spouses.\u00a0 When royalty is involved a certain amount of pomp and circumstance is expected by the public.\u00a0 We needed to know for sure.\u00a0 Namjoon can you please stand up and read your findings.\u201d\u00a0 Yoongi says while standing at the head of the table flanked by CL and yourself.\u00a0 Namjoon has a maid retrieve his briefcase from the living room.\u00a0 She holds it while he removes the necessary documents.\u00a0 He faces the crowd and clears his throat.</p><p>\t\u201cOkay so lets get started with the Min family.\u00a0 Genetically the four of you are all predominantly Vampire with a bit of Witch and Nymph DNA in the mix.\u00a0 CL is approximately 85% Vampire, 10% Witch, and 5% Nymph.\u00a0 Yoongi is 65% Vampire, 30 % Witch, and 5 % Nymph.\u00a0 Jungkook is 55% Vampire, 25% Witch, and 20% Nymph.\u00a0 Chanyeol is 60% Vampire, 20% Witch, and 20% Nymph.\u00a0 So while all of you possess powers some of your powers are Witch based and some are Nymph based.\u00a0 Before we burned your father I took a sample from him.\u00a0 He was 75% Vampire and 25% Nymph.\u00a0 So by my conclusions your mother must have had Witch DNA as well as Nymph DNA present.\u00a0 It is normal for Witches to have Nymph DNA present.\u201d\u00a0 Namjoon says but pausing to get a drink of wine.</p><p>\t\u201cSo is CL\u2019s DNA the reason why she has always been faster and stronger than me?\u201d\u00a0 Yoongi questions.</p><p>\t\u201cYes, she possesses the most Vampire DNA of all of the Min siblings and Jungkook possesses the least amount of Vampire DNA.\u00a0 But moving on to the spouses and future spouses.\u00a0 Let\u2019s start with Aurora\u2019s DNA.\u00a0 We know that she now possesses Vampire DNA but I compared the samples from before with the current samples and found some interesting data.\u00a0 Before, she was 75% Sage Witch, 20% Nephilim, and 5% Unknown.\u00a0 And now, she is 45% Sage Witch, 35% Vampire, and 20% Nephilim.\u00a0 So the only thing I can conclude was that the 5% from before was Vampire DNA but was shielded by her Nephilim DNA.\u00a0 I ran her DNA through the complete data base and only came up with four possible matches; King Taehyung, a Sage witch by the name of Queen Andromeda, a Vampire by the name of Prince Shin Hyun, and strangely enough it matched someone else in this room\u2026Byun Baekhyun.\u00a0 Let me explain a bit farther.\u00a0 King Taehyung is Aurora\u2019s brother, Andromeda was Aurora\u2019s grandmother, Prince Shin Hyun was her great grandfather, and Baekhyun is Aurora\u2019s cousin through her father and his mother.\u00a0 And with that being said let me move on to Baekhyun.\u00a0 Based on the DNA results you are not a Muse like you were always told you are 45% Nephilim and 55% Werewolf.\u00a0 Your mother was an angel or a Nephilim herself.\u201d\u00a0 Namjoon states before getting another sip of his wine. \u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWell, that explains the weird things that have been happening since I arrived here.\u00a0 I guess being this close to another Nephilim has activated something in me.\u00a0 I was raised by wolves and I didn\u2019t know my mother.\u00a0 So I am guessing that since I wasn\u2019t used to tapping into that part of me; it never manifested until now.\u00a0 This morning I was in the shower and my shoulders started itching.\u00a0 They have been itching ever since.\u201d\u00a0 Baekhyun says quietly and calmly.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cCome with me.\u00a0 Quickly now. \u00a0 We don\u2019t want them to emerge inside.\u201d\u00a0 You say as you take his hand.\u00a0 He looks at you confused.\u00a0 \u201cYou will see.\u201d\u00a0 You continue.\u00a0 You lead him to the garden.\u00a0 \u201cNow focus on the itch.\u00a0 This is going to hurt but really focus on it.\u201d\u00a0 You say as you look at him with a reassuring smile.\u00a0 He focuses on the itch and doubles over yelling.\u00a0 Suddenly the yelling stops and he raises up with two beautiful wings similar to Snow Owls wings.\u00a0 He stays silent for a moment and turns to look at Chanyeol who had followed them concerned for Baekhyun. \u00a0</p><p>\tChanyeol runs to his husband and embraces him.\u00a0 Chanyeol then kisses him and tells him. \u201cThey are beautiful just like you.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cOkay.\u00a0 Now that you have made them manifest; I need to teach you to conceal them as well as how to use them.\u00a0 Flight lessons will be for another day but for now let\u2019s get you to conceal them.\u00a0 Focus on your wolf side now.\u00a0 Don\u2019t let it come completely out but just under the surface; this should cause your wings to disappear for the time being.\u00a0 I am warning you however as you learn how to use your Nephilim abilities; they could appear with little warning.\u201d\u00a0 You say with a warm loving touch on the arm.\u00a0 Baekhyun nods and focuses while staring at his husband.\u00a0 His wings disappear but his eyes have now become a very light brown (almost yellow).\u00a0 The three of you return to the dinner.\u00a0 Namjoon decided to wait for you all to return before continuing. \u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNow that we are all present once again.\u00a0 Let us move on to King Taehyung.\u00a0 Before he was 65% Incubi and 35% Sage Witch and now he is 90% Incubi and 10% Sage Witch.\u00a0 His father was the late King Bogum and his mother was a Sage Witch.\u00a0 He is the rightful heir to the throne of the Incubi/Succubi Community.\u00a0 Now onto Bobby.\u00a0 Bobby, your DNA was unique to say the lease.\u00a0 You are a Kim by birth but you are also next in line for the throne after Taehyung.\u00a0 He is your cousin.\u00a0 You are Prince Ji-Won.\u00a0 The son of Kim Minseo and Prince of the Moon, Prince Joohyun.\u00a0 Prince Joohyun was King Bogum\u2019s younger brother.\u00a0 Minseo was Elder Kim\u2019s sister; which makes you our cousin as well.\u00a0 So in conclusion, all of the Min weddings this coming week will be royal affairs.\u00a0 The Min\u2019s are one of the oldest Royal houses.\u00a0 Although they got rid of the formalities long ago, they are all of royal blood and are all princes and princess.\u201d\u00a0 Namjoon states proudly.\u00a0 \u201cI would also like to clarify something for Jimin and myself.\u00a0 We were always told that we were Cambian Demons but genetically speaking; I am 5% Cambian, 10% Werewolf, 10% Werecat, and 75% Shapeshifter Demon.\u00a0 Jimin is 5 % Cambian, 10% Werewolf,\u00a0 10% Werecat, 65% Shapeshifter and 10% Jinn.\u00a0 We are shapeshifters more than anything.\u00a0 And I ran Jin\u2019s also,\u00a0 Before he was 65% Jinn and 35% Genie.\u00a0 Now he is, 35% Genie, 10% Jinn, 35% Vampire, 10% Incubi, 5% Werewolf, and 5% Shapeshifter.\u00a0 Due to Seokjin\u2019s experiments, Jin has been permanently altered.\u00a0 He will need our help in understanding his abilities as they manifest.\u00a0 He already has a test for blood.\u00a0 And this morning, he shifted into a dog.\u00a0 Even the slightest amount of DNA with is Jinn and Genie blood will cause abilities to manifest.\u00a0 Thank you for your time and patience.\u201d\u00a0 Namjoon concludes.\u00a0 \tEveryone continued dinner and went their separate ways; many wanting time to think about the revolutions that were revealed at dinner.\u00a0 As the night wore on, many retreated to the comforts of their home and bedrooms.\u00a0 All but one couple who slowly walked the gardens under the bright full moon.\u00a0 The two lone figures walk hand and hand as the soft lunar light illuminates the beautiful garden.</p><p>\t\u201cSo you are actually a Prince?\u00a0 Or are you a King now that your father has passed?\u201d\u00a0 You ask Yoongi.</p><p>\t\u201cI am a Prince.\u00a0 I am Prince of the Blood Moon, Prince Yoongi.\u00a0 CL is Princess of the Harvest Moon, Jungkook is Prince of the New Moon, and Chanyeol is Prince of the Snow Moon.\u00a0 And What about you, Princess?\u201d\u00a0 Yoongi says while staring at the moon.</p><p>\t\u201cWhat about me?\u00a0 I have no idea who my father was and my mother was what the Queen of Sage witches?\u201d\u00a0 You reply.</p><p>\t\u201cIf what Namjoon said is true; which I believe it is.\u00a0 Then you are Princess Aurora of The Rising Tide.\u00a0 Queen Andromeda was your Grandmother which would mean your mother was Queen Persephone.\u00a0 Queen Persephone was different from the previous queens because she only had one daughter but she had five sons, including Taehyung.\u00a0 I am willing to bet in the coming days as Namjoon\u2019s database becomes more complete that he will find your four other brothers also.\u00a0 So Princess Aurora of the Rising Tide, are you okay with marrying Prince Yoongi of the Blood Moon?\u201d\u00a0 Yoongi states as he kisses your forehead and embraces you.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYes.\u00a0 I am curious however to know more about my family history.\u00a0 Are there books on the Sage Witch royal family in the library?\u00a0 And I want to know more about Prince Shin Hyun as well.\u201d\u00a0 You reply as you both walk back to the house.</p><p>\t\u201cYeah, there are books on all the royal families that have lived in Korea.\u00a0 There is also several scrolls that I think only you or Baekhyun will be able to read; they are written in Enochian, the angelic language.\u00a0 Father was given them for safe keeping.\u00a0 Occasionally they glow and then more text occurs.\u00a0 But I think all of that can wait until another day.\u00a0 Right now you and the babies need to get your sleep.\u201d\u00a0 He says as you yawn and rest your head on his shoulder.\u00a0 You simply nod and he leads you to your bedroom.\u00a0 He helps you undress and change.\u00a0 You both climb into bed and embrace one another as you drift off to sleep.\u00a0</p>",

for help?\u201d\u00a0 Bobby tells CL while piling another book onto the stack in front of him.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYeah, maybe you are right.\u00a0 Aurora might know a spell to find the correct book.\u00a0 Or maybe Yoongi will know what book we need to look in.\u00a0 I need to call Namjoon to see if the DNA tests are done yet.\u00a0 That might help us know a bit more also.\u00a0 Don\u2019t worry, babe, we will find out what my father and Kai were talking about.\u00a0 But even if we don\u2019t, I will love you any ways.\u201d\u00a0 CL says as she kisses his cheek and takes out her phone.</p><p>\t\u201cWhile you are calling Namjoon, I am going to go see if I can find Aurora and Yoongi.\u00a0 Be back in a few, babe.\u201d\u00a0 Bobby says as he kisses her forehead.\u00a0 CL nods.</p><p>\t\u201cHey, Namjoon, it\u2019s CL.\u00a0 How have you been?\u00a0 I called to see if you have Bobby\u2019s DNA test done yet.\u00a0 I know you are busy but he really wants to know who he is before the wedding next week.\u201d\u00a0 CL tells him.</p><p>\t\u201cHey, CL.\u00a0 Jin and I doing well.\u00a0 We have been busy on converting the manor.\u00a0 I have his results and they are quite surprising.\u00a0 Jin and I will be by this evening for dinner; I will bring them then.\u201d\u00a0 Namjoon answers.</p><p>\t\u201cOkay.\u00a0 Thanks.\u00a0 See you both tonight.\u00a0 Bye.\u201d\u00a0 CL replies.</p><p>\t\u201cSee you tonight.\u00a0 Bye.\u201d\u00a0 Namjoon says as he hangs up.</p><p>\tMeanwhile, Bobby asks the head housekeeper, \u201cHave you seen Master Min or Lady Aurora around the compound?\u201d</p><p>\tShe stops dusting and replies with a smile, \u201cMaster Min is having a meeting at city hall and Lady Aurora is helping King Taehyung and Lord Jimin take all of the younger pups and the smaller children to the park to play.\u00a0 They are both set to return around 5pm before the dinner party, Master Bobby.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPlease just call me, Bobby.\u00a0 And thank you for your time.\u201d\u00a0 He says as he looks at his feet.</p><p>\t\u201cOh no, sir, I can\u2019t call you that.\u00a0 You are the future husband of Lady CL.\u00a0 It is not allowed.\u00a0 And you are welcome, Master.\u00a0 If I may be forward, you remind me a lot of a young prince who would visit the compound to play with Master Jungkook.\u00a0 But his name was Prince Ji-Won.\u00a0 His mother was the sister of Elder Kim and his father was the Late Prince of the Moon, Prince Joohyun.\u00a0 Prince Joohyun and his wife perished in a mysterious fire and it has long since been assumed that Prince Ji-Won was lost as well.\u00a0 But seeing you before me, I am not completely sure.\u00a0 Your eyes are like his were; kind, warm, loving, and full of life.\u201d\u00a0 She says with a warm smile.</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t know who I am really.\u00a0 Hyuna found me wandering the streets when I was young.\u00a0 I think I was seven or eight and I couldn\u2019t remember anything.\u00a0 That is why I needed Aurora and Yoongi.\u00a0 I was hoping they could help me figure it out.\u201d\u00a0 He says with a smile.\u00a0 \u201cI will let you get back to work.\u00a0 Sorry for bothering you and thank you for the information.\u201d\u00a0 He continues as he turns to return to the library.</p><p>\t\u201cNot a problem, young Master Bobby.\u00a0 I am sure you will know who you are soon enough.\u00a0 Nothing stays a secret for forever. \u00a0 And you are very welcome.\u201d\u00a0 She says as she returns to her dusting. \u00a0</p><p>\tHe ponders the information that he was just presented with.\u00a0 While he was lost in thought, he nearly tripped over a toy car that one of the children had left out.\u00a0 Still lost in thought as he enters the library; he doesn\u2019t realize that CL was talking to him.\u00a0 He snaps back to reality when CL touches his hand.\u00a0 He jumps slightly and says, \u201cWhat?\u00a0 I am sorry.\u00a0 What did Namjoon say?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cAre you okay?\u00a0 You seem a bit distracted.\u00a0 Sorry about scaring you.\u00a0 Namjoon said he will bring the results to the dinner tonight.\u201d\u00a0 CL says while she looks deep into his eyes. \u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI am fine; I guess.\u00a0 I asked a maid where Yoongi and Aurora was.\u00a0 She told me that they were out and would be back later.\u00a0 But before I walked away, she told me that I reminded her of a little boy who used to play with Jungkook.\u00a0 His name was Prince Ji-Won.\u00a0 She said something about his father was Prince of the Moon and that Elder Kim\u2019s sister was his mother.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know what to think.\u00a0 Do I get my hopes up or do I wait until Namjoon comes with the test results?\u201d\u00a0 Bobby says as he runs his hands through his hair and looks teary eyed at CL. \u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI think we need to take a break from his for now and go take a nap.\u00a0 You need some rest.\u00a0 Let\u2019s wait to see what Namjoon reveals tonight before we start searching for anything about your father, mother, and yourself.\u00a0 I love you.\u00a0 And I would love you whether you are a prince or you are a homeless lost soul from the streets.\u00a0 It is the man you are now that matters the most to me.\u201d\u00a0 CL responds with a loving smile and an outstretched hand.</p><p>\tHe takes her hand and allows her to lead him to their room.\u00a0 \u201cI Love You, babe.\u201d\u00a0 Bobby says as he follows behind.\u00a0 She walks him to the bed and lays him back.\u00a0 She climbs onto the bed and lays her head onto his chest; feeling the way his chest rises and falls and his heart beats like a marching cadence.\u00a0 Silently, they drift off to sleep.</p><p>\tCL wakes up to find the maid taking Soojin to the adjoining suite to play.\u00a0 She gets up and wakes Bobby, \u201cBobby, baby, time to wake up.\u00a0 Guests will be arriving soon.\u00a0 I am going to go bathe Soojin and get her ready and then I am going to take a shower.\u201d\u00a0 He lifts his head but rolls back over with a mumble.\u00a0 \u201cFine.\u00a0 I will let you sleep until I am done with my shower but after that you had better get up.\u00a0 Don\u2019t forget what I did the other day without meaning to.\u00a0 That poor dog\u2019s hair may never grow back.\u00a0 And I wasn\u2019t annoyed by it.\u00a0 It was a complete accident.\u201d\u00a0 She reminds him with a giggle.\u00a0 She goes to the other room and asks the maid, \u201cCan you make sure that Bobby\u2019s suit is laid out and my Lavender Cocktail dress is ready?\u201d\u00a0 The maid bows and hands her Soojin.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHi, babygirl.\u00a0 Did you have fun today with the other kids?\u00a0 Okay time for a bath and then big family dinner.\u201d\u00a0 CL says softly to her daughter.\u00a0 She takes her to the bath and bathes her.\u00a0 Soojin doesn\u2019t mind the water until CL washes her hair then Soojin screams at the top of her lungs and CL would swear that she has banshee in her if she didn\u2019t know better.\u00a0 \u201cDid you have fun?\u00a0 Mommy got soaked.\u00a0 Let\u2019s get you dressed and then we can go wake up daddy.\u201d\u00a0 CL tells the young girl.\u00a0 CL dries the baby and dresses her in a cute little black and red dress, white stockings, shiny black dress shoes and a ruffled diaper cover.\u00a0 CL brushes Soojin\u2019s hair into two tiny little pig tails and ties them with red ribbon.\u00a0 \u201cOkay lets go wake daddy.\u201d\u00a0 CL says and Soojin responds with a giggle.</p><p>\t\u201cDaddy, wake up.\u00a0 Your babygirl wants to see you.\u201d\u00a0 CL says as she puts Soojin on the bed and lets her crawl on top of Bobby.\u00a0 He opens his eyes and smiles.</p><p>\t\u201cHow is daddy\u2019s babygirl?\u00a0 You look so pretty.\u00a0 I guess it is just me and you until mommy gets done getting ready.\u00a0 Would you like me to play with you?\u201d\u00a0 Bobby inquires from his daughter.\u00a0 She smiles and giggles.\u00a0 He picks her up and takes her to her room.\u00a0 On the way, Bobby hugs CL around the waist and kisses her cheek.\u00a0 \u201cI Love you.\u00a0 And our daughter.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 That was one of the best wake up calls I have ever had.\u201d\u00a0 Bobby says before going to Soojin\u2019s room.\u00a0 CL smiles and goes to the bathroom to shower.\u00a0 She quickly showers and gets ready then goes to play with Soojin while Bobby bathes and gets changed.\u00a0 When he emerges from the bathroom, he goes to Soojin\u2019s room.\u00a0 \u201cOkay ladies, are we ready to go meet guests?\u00a0 And hopefully find out who I am.\u201d\u00a0 He says but with the last part said under his breath.\u00a0 They leave to head to the dining room.</p><p>\tThey enter the dining room and Yoongi and Aurora greeting all of the guests.\u00a0 The Min family, as well as the Jungs, Kims, and the Neo clan are all present.\u00a0 All are seated around a very large dining table and the maids have taken the children to the next room to feed them at their own table. \u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAs we all know, next week will begin a new chapter for the Min family.\u00a0 With that being said, there are a few things that need to be clarified.\u00a0 I had Namjoon run some basic DNA tests to clarify true lineage of all of the Mins and their future and current spouses.\u00a0 When royalty is involved a certain amount of pomp and circumstance is expected by the public.\u00a0 We needed to know for sure.\u00a0 Namjoon can you please stand up and read your findings.\u201d\u00a0 Yoongi says while standing at the head of the table flanked by CL and yourself.\u00a0 Namjoon has a maid retrieve his briefcase from the living room.\u00a0 She holds it while he removes the necessary documents.\u00a0 He faces the crowd and clears his throat.</p><p>\t\u201cOkay so lets get started with the Min family.\u00a0 Genetically the four of you are all predominantly Vampire with a bit of Witch and Nymph DNA in the mix.\u00a0 CL is approximately 85% Vampire, 10% Witch, and 5% Nymph.\u00a0 Yoongi is 65% Vampire, 30 % Witch, and 5 % Nymph.\u00a0 Jungkook is 55% Vampire, 25% Witch, and 20% Nymph.\u00a0 Chanyeol is 60% Vampire, 20% Witch, and 20% Nymph.\u00a0 So while all of you possess powers some of your powers are Witch based and some are Nymph based.\u00a0 Before we burned your father I took a sample from him.\u00a0 He was 75% Vampire and 25% Nymph.\u00a0 So by my conclusions your mother must have had Witch DNA as well as Nymph DNA present.\u00a0 It is normal for Witches to have Nymph DNA present.\u201d\u00a0 Namjoon says but pausing to get a drink of wine.</p><p>\t\u201cSo is CL\u2019s DNA the reason why she has always been faster and stronger than me?\u201d\u00a0 Yoongi questions.</p><p>\t\u201cYes, she possesses the most Vampire DNA of all of the Min siblings and Jungkook possesses the least amount of Vampire DNA.\u00a0 But moving on to the spouses and future spouses.\u00a0 Let\u2019s start with Aurora\u2019s DNA.\u00a0 We know that she now possesses Vampire DNA but I compared the samples from before with the current samples and found some interesting data.\u00a0 Before, she was 75% Sage Witch, 20% Nephilim, and 5% Unknown.\u00a0 And now, she is 45% Sage Witch, 35% Vampire, and 20% Nephilim.\u00a0 So the only thing I can conclude was that the 5% from before was Vampire DNA but was shielded by her Nephilim DNA.\u00a0 I ran her DNA through the complete data base and only came up with four possible matches; King Taehyung, a Sage witch by the name of Queen Andromeda, a Vampire by the name of Prince Shin Hyun, and strangely enough it matched someone else in this room\u2026Byun Baekhyun.\u00a0 Let me explain a bit farther.\u00a0 King Taehyung is Aurora\u2019s brother, Andromeda was Aurora\u2019s grandmother, Prince Shin Hyun was her great grandfather, and Baekhyun is Aurora\u2019s cousin through her father and his mother.\u00a0 And with that being said let me move on to Baekhyun.\u00a0 Based on the DNA results you are not a Muse like you were always told you are 45% Nephilim and 55% Werewolf.\u00a0 Your mother was an angel or a Nephilim herself.\u201d\u00a0 Namjoon states before getting another sip of his wine. \u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWell, that explains the weird things that have been happening since I arrived here.\u00a0 I guess being this close to another Nephilim has activated something in me.\u00a0 I was raised by wolves and I didn\u2019t know my mother.\u00a0 So I am guessing that since I wasn\u2019t used to tapping into that part of me; it never manifested until now.\u00a0 This morning I was in the shower and my shoulders started itching.\u00a0 They have been itching ever since.\u201d\u00a0 Baekhyun says quietly and calmly.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cCome with me.\u00a0 Quickly now. \u00a0 We don\u2019t want them to emerge inside.\u201d\u00a0 You say as you take his hand.\u00a0 He looks at you confused.\u00a0 \u201cYou will see.\u201d\u00a0 You continue.\u00a0 You lead him to the garden.\u00a0 \u201cNow focus on the itch.\u00a0 This is going to hurt but really focus on it.\u201d\u00a0 You say as you look at him with a reassuring smile.\u00a0 He focuses on the itch and doubles over yelling.\u00a0 Suddenly the yelling stops and he raises up with two beautiful wings similar to Snow Owls wings.\u00a0 He stays silent for a moment and turns to look at Chanyeol who had followed them concerned for Baekhyun. \u00a0</p><p>\tChanyeol runs to his husband and embraces him.\u00a0 Chanyeol then kisses him and tells him. \u201cThey are beautiful just like you.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cOkay.\u00a0 Now that you have made them manifest; I need to teach you to conceal them as well as how to use them.\u00a0 Flight lessons will be for another day but for now let\u2019s get you to conceal them.\u00a0 Focus on your wolf side now.\u00a0 Don\u2019t let it come completely out but just under the surface; this should cause your wings to disappear for the time being.\u00a0 I am warning you however as you learn how to use your Nephilim abilities; they could appear with little warning.\u201d\u00a0 You say with a warm loving touch on the arm.\u00a0 Baekhyun nods and focuses while staring at his husband.\u00a0 His wings disappear but his eyes have now become a very light brown (almost yellow).\u00a0 The three of you return to the dinner.\u00a0 Namjoon decided to wait for you all to return before continuing. \u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNow that we are all present once again.\u00a0 Let us move on to King Taehyung.\u00a0 Before he was 65% Incubi and 35% Sage Witch and now he is 90% Incubi and 10% Sage Witch.\u00a0 His father was the late King Bogum and his mother was a Sage Witch.\u00a0 He is the rightful heir to the throne of the Incubi/Succubi Community.\u00a0 Now onto Bobby.\u00a0 Bobby, your DNA was unique to say the lease.\u00a0 You are a Kim by birth but you are also next in line for the throne after Taehyung.\u00a0 He is your cousin.\u00a0 You are Prince Ji-Won.\u00a0 The son of Kim Minseo and Prince of the Moon, Prince Joohyun.\u00a0 Prince Joohyun was King Bogum\u2019s younger brother.\u00a0 Minseo was Elder Kim\u2019s sister; which makes you our cousin as well.\u00a0 So in conclusion, all of the Min weddings this coming week will be royal affairs.\u00a0 The Min\u2019s are one of the oldest Royal houses.\u00a0 Although they got rid of the formalities long ago, they are all of royal blood and are all princes and princess.\u201d\u00a0 Namjoon states proudly.\u00a0 \u201cI would also like to clarify something for Jimin and myself.\u00a0 We were always told that we were Cambian Demons but genetically speaking; I am 5% Cambian, 10% Werewolf, 10% Werecat, and 75% Shapeshifter Demon.\u00a0 Jimin is 5 % Cambian, 10% Werewolf,\u00a0 10% Werecat, 65% Shapeshifter and 10% Jinn.\u00a0 We are shapeshifters more than anything.\u00a0 And I ran Jin\u2019s also,\u00a0 Before he was 65% Jinn and 35% Genie.\u00a0 Now he is, 35% Genie, 10% Jinn, 35% Vampire, 10% Incubi, 5% Werewolf, and 5% Shapeshifter.\u00a0 Due to Seokjin\u2019s experiments, Jin has been permanently altered.\u00a0 He will need our help in understanding his abilities as they manifest.\u00a0 He already has a test for blood.\u00a0 And this morning, he shifted into a dog.\u00a0 Even the slightest amount of DNA with is Jinn and Genie blood will cause abilities to manifest.\u00a0 Thank you for your time and patience.\u201d\u00a0 Namjoon concludes.\u00a0 \tEveryone continued dinner and went their separate ways; many wanting time to think about the revolutions that were revealed at dinner.\u00a0 As the night wore on, many retreated to the comforts of their home and bedrooms.\u00a0 All but one couple who slowly walked the gardens under the bright full moon.\u00a0 The two lone figures walk hand and hand as the soft lunar light illuminates the beautiful garden.</p><p>\t\u201cSo you are actually a Prince?\u00a0 Or are you a King now that your father has passed?\u201d\u00a0 You ask Yoongi.</p><p>\t\u201cI am a Prince.\u00a0 I am Prince of the Blood Moon, Prince Yoongi.\u00a0 CL is Princess of the Harvest Moon, Jungkook is Prince of the New Moon, and Chanyeol is Prince of the Snow Moon.\u00a0 And What about you, Princess?\u201d\u00a0 Yoongi says while staring at the moon.</p><p>\t\u201cWhat about me?\u00a0 I have no idea who my father was and my mother was what the Queen of Sage witches?\u201d\u00a0 You reply.</p><p>\t\u201cIf what Namjoon said is true; which I believe it is.\u00a0 Then you are Princess Aurora of The Rising Tide.\u00a0 Queen Andromeda was your Grandmother which would mean your mother was Queen Persephone.\u00a0 Queen Persephone was different from the previous queens because she only had one daughter but she had five sons, including Taehyung.\u00a0 I am willing to bet in the coming days as Namjoon\u2019s database becomes more complete that he will find your four other brothers also.\u00a0 So Princess Aurora of the Rising Tide, are you okay with marrying Prince Yoongi of the Blood Moon?\u201d\u00a0 Yoongi states as he kisses your forehead and embraces you.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYes.\u00a0 I am curious however to know more about my family history.\u00a0 Are there books on the Sage Witch royal family in the library?\u00a0 And I want to know more about Prince Shin Hyun as well.\u201d\u00a0 You reply as you both walk back to the house.</p><p>\t\u201cYeah, there are books on all the royal families that have lived in Korea.\u00a0 There is also several scrolls that I think only you or Baekhyun will be able to read; they are written in Enochian, the angelic language.\u00a0 Father was given them for safe keeping.\u00a0 Occasionally they glow and then more text occurs.\u00a0 But I think all of that can wait until another day.\u00a0 Right now you and the babies need to get your sleep.\u201d\u00a0 He says as you yawn and rest your head on his shoulder.\u00a0 You simply nod and he leads you to your bedroom.\u00a0 He helps you undress and change.\u00a0 You both climb into bed and embrace one another as you drift off to sleep.\u00a0</p>",

Hyuna and the \u201cDolls\u201d have left to get settled into their new positions in Daegu but plan to return for the weddings.\u00a0 The Kim Manor has begun the transition to school.\u00a0 The Kims and Jungs have moved into the Kim manor.\u00a0 And all of the Min siblings have settled into suites throughout the compound.\u00a0 The Elementals, The Alcolytes, and the witch orphans have left to start the magic academy outside of Busan.\u00a0 N has taken over the role of CEO of all of the Min and Park holdings in Busan.\u00a0 They all plan on returning to the compound for the weddings.</p><p>\t\u201cWe are never going to find the right book in this library.\u00a0 We have spent the last ten days looking through all of these books and haven\u2019t found anything yet.\u00a0 Maybe we should ask Aurora for help?\u201d\u00a0 Bobby tells CL while piling another book onto the stack in front of him.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYeah, maybe you are right.\u00a0 Aurora might know a spell to find the correct book.\u00a0 Or maybe Yoongi will know what book we need to look in.\u00a0 I need to call Namjoon to see if the DNA tests are done yet.\u00a0 That might help us know a bit more also.\u00a0 Don\u2019t worry, babe, we will find out what my father and Kai were talking about.\u00a0 But even if we don\u2019t, I will love you any ways.\u201d\u00a0 CL says as she kisses his cheek and takes out her phone.</p><p>\t\u201cWhile you are calling Namjoon, I am going to go see if I can find Aurora and Yoongi.\u00a0 Be back in a few, babe.\u201d\u00a0 Bobby says as he kisses her forehead.\u00a0 CL nods.</p><p>\t\u201cHey, Namjoon, it\u2019s CL.\u00a0 How have you been?\u00a0 I called to see if you have Bobby\u2019s DNA test done yet.\u00a0 I know you are busy but he really wants to know who he is before the wedding next week.\u201d\u00a0 CL tells him.</p><p>\t\u201cHey, CL.\u00a0 Jin and I doing well.\u00a0 We have been busy on converting the manor.\u00a0 I have his results and they are quite surprising.\u00a0 Jin and I will be by this evening for dinner; I will bring them then.\u201d\u00a0 Namjoon answers.</p><p>\t\u201cOkay.\u00a0 Thanks.\u00a0 See you both tonight.\u00a0 Bye.\u201d\u00a0 CL replies.</p><p>\t\u201cSee you tonight.\u00a0 Bye.\u201d\u00a0 Namjoon says as he hangs up.</p><p>\tMeanwhile, Bobby asks the head housekeeper, \u201cHave you seen Master Min or Lady Aurora around the compound?\u201d</p><p>\tShe stops dusting and replies with a smile, \u201cMaster Min is having a meeting at city hall and Lady Aurora is helping King Taehyung and Lord Jimin take all of the younger pups and the smaller children to the park to play.\u00a0 They are both set to return around 5pm before the dinner party, Master Bobby.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPlease just call me, Bobby.\u00a0 And thank you for your time.\u201d\u00a0 He says as he looks at his feet.</p><p>\t\u201cOh no, sir, I can\u2019t call you that.\u00a0 You are the future husband of Lady CL.\u00a0 It is not allowed.\u00a0 And you are welcome, Master.\u00a0 If I may be forward, you remind me a lot of a young prince who would visit the compound to play with Master Jungkook.\u00a0 But his name was Prince Ji-Won.\u00a0 His mother was the sister of Elder Kim and his father was the Late Prince of the Moon, Prince Joohyun.\u00a0 Prince Joohyun and his wife perished in a mysterious fire and it has long since been assumed that Prince Ji-Won was lost as well.\u00a0 But seeing you before me, I am not completely sure.\u00a0 Your eyes are like his were; kind, warm, loving, and full of life.\u201d\u00a0 She says with a warm smile.</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t know who I am really.\u00a0 Hyuna found me wandering the streets when I was young.\u00a0 I think I was seven or eight and I couldn\u2019t remember anything.\u00a0 That is why I needed Aurora and Yoongi.\u00a0 I was hoping they could help me figure it out.\u201d\u00a0 He says with a smile.\u00a0 \u201cI will let you get back to work.\u00a0 Sorry for bothering you and thank you for the information.\u201d\u00a0 He continues as he turns to return to the library.</p><p>\t\u201cNot a problem, young Master Bobby.\u00a0 I am sure you will know who you are soon enough.\u00a0 Nothing stays a secret for forever. \u00a0 And you are very welcome.\u201d\u00a0 She says as she returns to her dusting. \u00a0</p><p>\tHe ponders the information that he was just presented with.\u00a0 While he was lost in thought, he nearly tripped over a toy car that one of the children had left out.\u00a0 Still lost in thought as he enters the library; he doesn\u2019t realize that CL was talking to him.\u00a0 He snaps back to reality when CL touches his hand.\u00a0 He jumps slightly and says, \u201cWhat?\u00a0 I am sorry.\u00a0 What did Namjoon say?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cAre you okay?\u00a0 You seem a bit distracted.\u00a0 Sorry about scaring you.\u00a0 Namjoon said he will bring the results to the dinner tonight.\u201d\u00a0 CL says while she looks deep into his eyes. \u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI am fine; I guess.\u00a0 I asked a maid where Yoongi and Aurora was.\u00a0 She told me that they were out and would be back later.\u00a0 But before I walked away, she told me that I reminded her of a little boy who used to play with Jungkook.\u00a0 His name was Prince Ji-Won.\u00a0 She said something about his father was Prince of the Moon and that Elder Kim\u2019s sister was his mother.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know what to think.\u00a0 Do I get my hopes up or do I wait until Namjoon comes with the test results?\u201d\u00a0 Bobby says as he runs his hands through his hair and looks teary eyed at CL. \u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI think we need to take a break from his for now and go take a nap.\u00a0 You need some rest.\u00a0 Let\u2019s wait to see what Namjoon reveals tonight before we start searching for anything about your father, mother, and yourself.\u00a0 I love you.\u00a0 And I would love you whether you are a prince or you are a homeless lost soul from the streets.\u00a0 It is the man you are now that matters the most to me.\u201d\u00a0 CL responds with a loving smile and an outstretched hand.</p><p>\tHe takes her hand and allows her to lead him to their room.\u00a0 \u201cI Love You, babe.\u201d\u00a0 Bobby says as he follows behind.\u00a0 She walks him to the bed and lays him back.\u00a0 She climbs onto the bed and lays her head onto his chest; feeling the way his chest rises and falls and his heart beats like a marching cadence.\u00a0 Silently, they drift off to sleep.</p><p>\tCL wakes up to find the maid taking Soojin to the adjoining suite to play.\u00a0 She gets up and wakes Bobby, \u201cBobby, baby, time to wake up.\u00a0 Guests will be arriving soon.\u00a0 I am going to go bathe Soojin and get her ready and then I am going to take a shower.\u201d\u00a0 He lifts his head but rolls back over with a mumble.\u00a0 \u201cFine.\u00a0 I will let you sleep until I am done with my shower but after that you had better get up.\u00a0 Don\u2019t forget what I did the other day without meaning to.\u00a0 That poor dog\u2019s hair may never grow back.\u00a0 And I wasn\u2019t annoyed by it.\u00a0 It was a complete accident.\u201d\u00a0 She reminds him with a giggle.\u00a0 She goes to the other room and asks the maid, \u201cCan you make sure that Bobby\u2019s suit is laid out and my Lavender Cocktail dress is ready?\u201d\u00a0 The maid bows and hands her Soojin.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHi, babygirl.\u00a0 Did you have fun today with the other kids?\u00a0 Okay time for a bath and then big family dinner.\u201d\u00a0 CL says softly to her daughter.\u00a0 She takes her to the bath and bathes her.\u00a0 Soojin doesn\u2019t mind the water until CL washes her hair then Soojin screams at the top of her lungs and CL would swear that she has banshee in her if she didn\u2019t know better.\u00a0 \u201cDid you have fun?\u00a0 Mommy got soaked.\u00a0 Let\u2019s get you dressed and then we can go wake up daddy.\u201d\u00a0 CL tells the young girl.\u00a0 CL dries the baby and dresses her in a cute little black and red dress, white stockings, shiny black dress shoes and a ruffled diaper cover.\u00a0 CL brushes Soojin\u2019s hair into two tiny little pig tails and ties them with red ribbon.\u00a0 \u201cOkay lets go wake daddy.\u201d\u00a0 CL says and Soojin responds with a giggle.</p><p>\t\u201cDaddy, wake up.\u00a0 Your babygirl wants to see you.\u201d\u00a0 CL says as she puts Soojin on the bed and lets her crawl on top of Bobby.\u00a0 He opens his eyes and smiles.</p><p>\t\u201cHow is daddy\u2019s babygirl?\u00a0 You look so pretty.\u00a0 I guess it is just me and you until mommy gets done getting ready.\u00a0 Would you like me to play with you?\u201d\u00a0 Bobby inquires from his daughter.\u00a0 She smiles and giggles.\u00a0 He picks her up and takes her to her room.\u00a0 On the way, Bobby hugs CL around the waist and kisses her cheek.\u00a0 \u201cI Love you.\u00a0 And our daughter.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 That was one of the best wake up calls I have ever had.\u201d\u00a0 Bobby says before going to Soojin\u2019s room.\u00a0 CL smiles and goes to the bathroom to shower.\u00a0 She quickly showers and gets ready then goes to play with Soojin while Bobby bathes and gets changed.\u00a0 When he emerges from the bathroom, he goes to Soojin\u2019s room.\u00a0 \u201cOkay ladies, are we ready to go meet guests?\u00a0 And hopefully find out who I am.\u201d\u00a0 He says but with the last part said under his breath.\u00a0 They leave to head to the dining room.</p><p>\tThey enter the dining room and Yoongi and Aurora greeting all of the guests.\u00a0 The Min family, as well as the Jungs, Kims, and the Neo clan are all present.\u00a0 All are seated around a very large dining table and the maids have taken the children to the next room to feed them at their own table. \u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAs we all know, next week will begin a new chapter for the Min family.\u00a0 With that being said, there are a few things that need to be clarified.\u00a0 I had Namjoon run some basic DNA tests to clarify true lineage of all of the Mins and their future and current spouses.\u00a0 When royalty is involved a certain amount of pomp and circumstance is expected by the public.\u00a0 We needed to know for sure.\u00a0 Namjoon can you please stand up and read your findings.\u201d\u00a0 Yoongi says while standing at the head of the table flanked by CL and yourself.\u00a0 Namjoon has a maid retrieve his briefcase from the living room.\u00a0 She holds it while he removes the necessary documents.\u00a0 He faces the crowd and clears his throat.</p><p>\t\u201cOkay so lets get started with the Min family.\u00a0 Genetically the four of you are all predominantly Vampire with a bit of Witch and Nymph DNA in the mix.\u00a0 CL is approximately 85% Vampire, 10% Witch, and 5% Nymph.\u00a0 Yoongi is 65% Vampire, 30 % Witch, and 5 % Nymph.\u00a0 Jungkook is 55% Vampire, 25% Witch, and 20% Nymph.\u00a0 Chanyeol is 60% Vampire, 20% Witch, and 20% Nymph.\u00a0 So while all of you possess powers some of your powers are Witch based and some are Nymph based.\u00a0 Before we burned your father I took a sample from him.\u00a0 He was 75% Vampire and 25% Nymph.\u00a0 So by my conclusions your mother must have had Witch DNA as well as Nymph DNA present.\u00a0 It is normal for Witches to have Nymph DNA present.\u201d\u00a0 Namjoon says but pausing to get a drink of wine.</p><p>\t\u201cSo is CL\u2019s DNA the reason why she has always been faster and stronger than me?\u201d\u00a0 Yoongi questions.</p><p>\t\u201cYes, she possesses the most Vampire DNA of all of the Min siblings and Jungkook possesses the least amount of Vampire DNA.\u00a0 But moving on to the spouses and future spouses.\u00a0 Let\u2019s start with Aurora\u2019s DNA.\u00a0 We know that she now possesses Vampire DNA but I compared the samples from before with the current samples and found some interesting data.\u00a0 Before, she was 75% Sage Witch, 20% Nephilim, and 5% Unknown.\u00a0 And now, she is 45% Sage Witch, 35% Vampire, and 20% Nephilim.\u00a0 So the only thing I can conclude was that the 5% from before was Vampire DNA but was shielded by her Nephilim DNA.\u00a0 I ran her DNA through the complete data base and only came up with four possible matches; King Taehyung, a Sage witch by the name of Queen Andromeda, a Vampire by the name of Prince Shin Hyun, and strangely enough it matched someone else in this room\u2026Byun Baekhyun.\u00a0 Let me explain a bit farther.\u00a0 King Taehyung is Aurora\u2019s brother, Andromeda was Aurora\u2019s grandmother, Prince Shin Hyun was her great grandfather, and Baekhyun is Aurora\u2019s cousin through her father and his mother.\u00a0 And with that being said let me move on to Baekhyun.\u00a0 Based on the DNA results you are not a Muse like you were always told you are 45% Nephilim and 55% Werewolf.\u00a0 Your mother was an angel or a Nephilim herself.\u201d\u00a0 Namjoon states before getting another sip of his wine. \u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWell, that explains the weird things that have been happening since I arrived here.\u00a0 I guess being this close to another Nephilim has activated something in me.\u00a0 I was raised by wolves and I didn\u2019t know my mother.\u00a0 So I am guessing that since I wasn\u2019t used to tapping into that part of me; it never manifested until now.\u00a0 This morning I was in the shower and my shoulders started itching.\u00a0 They have been itching ever since.\u201d\u00a0 Baekhyun says quietly and calmly.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cCome with me.\u00a0 Quickly now. \u00a0 We don\u2019t want them to emerge inside.\u201d\u00a0 You say as you take his hand.\u00a0 He looks at you confused.\u00a0 \u201cYou will see.\u201d\u00a0 You continue.\u00a0 You lead him to the garden.\u00a0 \u201cNow focus on the itch.\u00a0 This is going to hurt but really focus on it.\u201d\u00a0 You say as you look at him with a reassuring smile.\u00a0 He focuses on the itch and doubles over yelling.\u00a0 Suddenly the yelling stops and he raises up with two beautiful wings similar to Snow Owls wings.\u00a0 He stays silent for a moment and turns to look at Chanyeol who had followed them concerned for Baekhyun. \u00a0</p><p>\tChanyeol runs to his husband and embraces him.\u00a0 Chanyeol then kisses him and tells him. \u201cThey are beautiful just like you.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cOkay.\u00a0 Now that you have made them manifest; I need to teach you to conceal them as well as how to use them.\u00a0 Flight lessons will be for another day but for now let\u2019s get you to conceal them.\u00a0 Focus on your wolf side now.\u00a0 Don\u2019t let it come completely out but just under the surface; this should cause your wings to disappear for the time being.\u00a0 I am warning you however as you learn how to use your Nephilim abilities; they could appear with little warning.\u201d\u00a0 You say with a warm loving touch on the arm.\u00a0 Baekhyun nods and focuses while staring at his husband.\u00a0 His wings disappear but his eyes have now become a very light brown (almost yellow).\u00a0 The three of you return to the dinner.\u00a0 Namjoon decided to wait for you all to return before continuing. \u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNow that we are all present once again.\u00a0 Let us move on to King Taehyung.\u00a0 Before he was 65% Incubi and 35% Sage Witch and now he is 90% Incubi and 10% Sage Witch.\u00a0 His father was the late King Bogum and his mother was a Sage Witch.\u00a0 He is the rightful heir to the throne of the Incubi/Succubi Community.\u00a0 Now onto Bobby.\u00a0 Bobby, your DNA was unique to say the lease.\u00a0 You are a Kim by birth but you are also next in line for the throne after Taehyung.\u00a0 He is your cousin.\u00a0 You are Prince Ji-Won.\u00a0 The son of Kim Minseo and Prince of the Moon, Prince Joohyun.\u00a0 Prince Joohyun was King Bogum\u2019s younger brother.\u00a0 Minseo was Elder Kim\u2019s sister; which makes you our cousin as well.\u00a0 So in conclusion, all of the Min weddings this coming week will be royal affairs.\u00a0 The Min\u2019s are one of the oldest Royal houses.\u00a0 Although they got rid of the formalities long ago, they are all of royal blood and are all princes and princess.\u201d\u00a0 Namjoon states proudly.\u00a0 \u201cI would also like to clarify something for Jimin and myself.\u00a0 We were always told that we were Cambian Demons but genetically speaking; I am 5% Cambian, 10% Werewolf, 10% Werecat, and 75% Shapeshifter Demon.\u00a0 Jimin is 5 % Cambian, 10% Werewolf,\u00a0 10% Werecat, 65% Shapeshifter and 10% Jinn.\u00a0 We are shapeshifters more than anything.\u00a0 And I ran Jin\u2019s also,\u00a0 Before he was 65% Jinn and 35% Genie.\u00a0 Now he is, 35% Genie, 10% Jinn, 35% Vampire, 10% Incubi, 5% Werewolf, and 5% Shapeshifter.\u00a0 Due to Seokjin\u2019s experiments, Jin has been permanently altered.\u00a0 He will need our help in understanding his abilities as they manifest.\u00a0 He already has a test for blood.\u00a0 And this morning, he shifted into a dog.\u00a0 Even the slightest amount of DNA with is Jinn and Genie blood will cause abilities to manifest.\u00a0 Thank you for your time and patience.\u201d\u00a0 Namjoon concludes.\u00a0 \tEveryone continued dinner and went their separate ways; many wanting time to think about the revolutions that were revealed at dinner.\u00a0 As the night wore on, many retreated to the comforts of their home and bedrooms.\u00a0 All but one couple who slowly walked the gardens under the bright full moon.\u00a0 The two lone figures walk hand and hand as the soft lunar light illuminates the beautiful garden.</p><p>\t\u201cSo you are actually a Prince?\u00a0 Or are you a King now that your father has passed?\u201d\u00a0 You ask Yoongi.</p><p>\t\u201cI am a Prince.\u00a0 I am Prince of the Blood Moon, Prince Yoongi.\u00a0 CL is Princess of the Harvest Moon, Jungkook is Prince of the New Moon, and Chanyeol is Prince of the Snow Moon.\u00a0 And What about you, Princess?\u201d\u00a0 Yoongi says while staring at the moon.</p><p>\t\u201cWhat about me?\u00a0 I have no idea who my father was and my mother was what the Queen of Sage witches?\u201d\u00a0 You reply.</p><p>\t\u201cIf what Namjoon said is true; which I believe it is.\u00a0 Then you are Princess Aurora of The Rising Tide.\u00a0 Queen Andromeda was your Grandmother which would mean your mother was Queen Persephone.\u00a0 Queen Persephone was different from the previous queens because she only had one daughter but she had five sons, including Taehyung.\u00a0 I am willing to bet in the coming days as Namjoon\u2019s database becomes more complete that he will find your four other brothers also.\u00a0 So Princess Aurora of the Rising Tide, are you okay with marrying Prince Yoongi of the Blood Moon?\u201d\u00a0 Yoongi states as he kisses your forehead and embraces you.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYes.\u00a0 I am curious however to know more about my family history.\u00a0 Are there books on the Sage Witch royal family in the library?\u00a0 And I want to know more about Prince Shin Hyun as well.\u201d\u00a0 You reply as you both walk back to the house.</p><p>\t\u201cYeah, there are books on all the royal families that have lived in Korea.\u00a0 There is also several scrolls that I think only you or Baekhyun will be able to read; they are written in Enochian, the angelic language.\u00a0 Father was given them for safe keeping.\u00a0 Occasionally they glow and then more text occurs.\u00a0 But I think all of that can wait until another day.\u00a0 Right now you and the babies need to get your sleep.\u201d\u00a0 He says as you yawn and rest your head on his shoulder.\u00a0 You simply nod and he leads you to your bedroom.\u00a0 He helps you undress and change.\u00a0 You both climb into bed and embrace one another as you drift off to sleep.\u00a0</p>",
                "content": "<p>The last twelve days have been somewhat a blur.&nbsp; The Neo Clan has moved into a nice house close to the Police station and have started their patrols.&nbsp; Hyuna and the &ldquo;Dolls&rdquo; have left to get settled into their new positions in Daegu but plan to return for the weddings.&nbsp; The Kim Manor has begun the transition to school.&nbsp; The Kims and Jungs have moved into the Kim manor.&nbsp; And all of the Min siblings have settled into suites throughout the compound.&nbsp; The Elementals, The Alcolytes, and the witch orphans have left to start the magic academy outside of Busan.&nbsp; N has taken over the role of CEO of all of the Min and Park holdings in Busan.&nbsp; They all plan on returning to the compound for the weddings.</p><p>\t&ldquo;We are never going to find the right book in this library.&nbsp; We have spent the last ten days looking through all of these books and haven&rsquo;t found anything yet.&nbsp; Maybe we should ask Aurora for help?&rdquo;&nbsp; Bobby tells CL while piling another book onto the stack in front of him.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Yeah, maybe you are right.&nbsp; Aurora might know a spell to find the correct book.&nbsp; Or maybe Yoongi will know what book we need to look in.&nbsp; I need to call Namjoon to see if the DNA tests are done yet.&nbsp; That might help us know a bit more also.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t worry, babe, we will find out what my father and Kai were talking about.&nbsp; But even if we don&rsquo;t, I will love you any ways.&rdquo;&nbsp; CL says as she kisses his cheek and takes out her phone.</p><p>\t&ldquo;While you are calling Namjoon, I am going to go see if I can find Aurora and Yoongi.&nbsp; Be back in a few, babe.&rdquo;&nbsp; Bobby says as he kisses her forehead.&nbsp; CL nods.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Hey, Namjoon, it&rsquo;s CL.&nbsp; How have you been?&nbsp; I called to see if you have Bobby&rsquo;s DNA test done yet.&nbsp; I know you are busy but he really wants to know who he is before the wedding next week.&rdquo;&nbsp; CL tells him.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Hey, CL.&nbsp; Jin and I doing well.&nbsp; We have been busy on converting the manor.&nbsp; I have his results and they are quite surprising.&nbsp; Jin and I will be by this evening for dinner; I will bring them then.&rdquo;&nbsp; Namjoon answers.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Okay.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; See you both tonight.&nbsp; Bye.&rdquo;&nbsp; CL replies.</p><p>\t&ldquo;See you tonight.&nbsp; Bye.&rdquo;&nbsp; Namjoon says as he hangs up.</p><p>\tMeanwhile, Bobby asks the head housekeeper, &ldquo;Have you seen Master Min or Lady Aurora around the compound?&rdquo;</p><p>\tShe stops dusting and replies with a smile, &ldquo;Master Min is having a meeting at city hall and Lady Aurora is helping King Taehyung and Lord Jimin take all of the younger pups and the smaller children to the park to play.&nbsp; They are both set to return around 5pm before the dinner party, Master Bobby.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Please just call me, Bobby.&nbsp; And thank you for your time.&rdquo;&nbsp; He says as he looks at his feet.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Oh no, sir, I can&rsquo;t call you that.&nbsp; You are the future husband of Lady CL.&nbsp; It is not allowed.&nbsp; And you are welcome, Master.&nbsp; If I may be forward, you remind me a lot of a young prince who would visit the compound to play with Master Jungkook.&nbsp; But his name was Prince Ji-Won.&nbsp; His mother was the sister of Elder Kim and his father was the Late Prince of the Moon, Prince Joohyun.&nbsp; Prince Joohyun and his wife perished in a mysterious fire and it has long since been assumed that Prince Ji-Won was lost as well.&nbsp; But seeing you before me, I am not completely sure.&nbsp; Your eyes are like his were; kind, warm, loving, and full of life.&rdquo;&nbsp; She says with a warm smile.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who I am really.&nbsp; Hyuna found me wandering the streets when I was young.&nbsp; I think I was seven or eight and I couldn&rsquo;t remember anything.&nbsp; That is why I needed Aurora and Yoongi.&nbsp; I was hoping they could help me figure it out.&rdquo;&nbsp; He says with a smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will let you get back to work.&nbsp; Sorry for bothering you and thank you for the information.&rdquo;&nbsp; He continues as he turns to return to the library.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Not a problem, young Master Bobby.&nbsp; I am sure you will know who you are soon enough.&nbsp; Nothing stays a secret for forever. &nbsp; And you are very welcome.&rdquo;&nbsp; She says as she returns to her dusting. &nbsp;</p><p>\tHe ponders the information that he was just presented with.&nbsp; While he was lost in thought, he nearly tripped over a toy car that one of the children had left out.&nbsp; Still lost in thought as he enters the library; he doesn&rsquo;t realize that CL was talking to him.&nbsp; He snaps back to reality when CL touches his hand.&nbsp; He jumps slightly and says, &ldquo;What?&nbsp; I am sorry.&nbsp; What did Namjoon say?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Are you okay?&nbsp; You seem a bit distracted.&nbsp; Sorry about scaring you.&nbsp; Namjoon said he will bring the results to the dinner tonight.&rdquo;&nbsp; CL says while she looks deep into his eyes. &nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I am fine; I guess.&nbsp; I asked a maid where Yoongi and Aurora was.&nbsp; She told me that they were out and would be back later.&nbsp; But before I walked away, she told me that I reminded her of a little boy who used to play with Jungkook.&nbsp; His name was Prince Ji-Won.&nbsp; She said something about his father was Prince of the Moon and that Elder Kim&rsquo;s sister was his mother.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what to think.&nbsp; Do I get my hopes up or do I wait until Namjoon comes with the test results?&rdquo;&nbsp; Bobby says as he runs his hands through his hair and looks teary eyed at CL. &nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I think we need to take a break from his for now and go take a nap.&nbsp; You need some rest.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s wait to see what Namjoon reveals tonight before we start searching for anything about your father, mother, and yourself.&nbsp; I love you.&nbsp; And I would love you whether you are a prince or you are a homeless lost soul from the streets.&nbsp; It is the man you are now that matters the most to me.&rdquo;&nbsp; CL responds with a loving smile and an outstretched hand.</p><p>\tHe takes her hand and allows her to lead him to their room.&nbsp; &ldquo;I Love You, babe.&rdquo;&nbsp; Bobby says as he follows behind.&nbsp; She walks him to the bed and lays him back.&nbsp; She climbs onto the bed and lays her head onto his chest; feeling the way his chest rises and falls and his heart beats like a marching cadence.&nbsp; Silently, they drift off to sleep.</p><p>\tCL wakes up to find the maid taking Soojin to the adjoining suite to play.&nbsp; She gets up and wakes Bobby, &ldquo;Bobby, baby, time to wake up.&nbsp; Guests will be arriving soon.&nbsp; I am going to go bathe Soojin and get her ready and then I am going to take a shower.&rdquo;&nbsp; He lifts his head but rolls back over with a mumble.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fine.&nbsp; I will let you sleep until I am done with my shower but after that you had better get up.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t forget what I did the other day without meaning to.&nbsp; That poor dog&rsquo;s hair may never grow back.&nbsp; And I wasn&rsquo;t annoyed by it.&nbsp; It was a complete accident.&rdquo;&nbsp; She reminds him with a giggle.&nbsp; She goes to the other room and asks the maid, &ldquo;Can you make sure that Bobby&rsquo;s suit is laid out and my Lavender Cocktail dress is ready?&rdquo;&nbsp; The maid bows and hands her Soojin.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Hi, babygirl.&nbsp; Did you have fun today with the other kids?&nbsp; Okay time for a bath and then big family dinner.&rdquo;&nbsp; CL says softly to her daughter.&nbsp; She takes her to the bath and bathes her.&nbsp; Soojin doesn&rsquo;t mind the water until CL washes her hair then Soojin screams at the top of her lungs and CL would swear that she has banshee in her if she didn&rsquo;t know better.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you have fun?&nbsp; Mommy got soaked.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s get you dressed and then we can go wake up daddy.&rdquo;&nbsp; CL tells the young girl.&nbsp; CL dries the baby and dresses her in a cute little black and red dress, white stockings, shiny black dress shoes and a ruffled diaper cover.&nbsp; CL brushes Soojin&rsquo;s hair into two tiny little pig tails and ties them with red ribbon.&nbsp; &ldquo;Okay lets go wake daddy.&rdquo;&nbsp; CL says and Soojin responds with a giggle.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Daddy, wake up.&nbsp; Your babygirl wants to see you.&rdquo;&nbsp; CL says as she puts Soojin on the bed and lets her crawl on top of Bobby.&nbsp; He opens his eyes and smiles.</p><p>\t&ldquo;How is daddy&rsquo;s babygirl?&nbsp; You look so pretty.&nbsp; I guess it is just me and you until mommy gets done getting ready.&nbsp; Would you like me to play with you?&rdquo;&nbsp; Bobby inquires from his daughter.&nbsp; She smiles and giggles.&nbsp; He picks her up and takes her to her room.&nbsp; On the way, Bobby hugs CL around the waist and kisses her cheek.&nbsp; &ldquo;I Love you.&nbsp; And our daughter.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; That was one of the best wake up calls I have ever had.&rdquo;&nbsp; Bobby says before going to Soojin&rsquo;s room.&nbsp; CL smiles and goes to the bathroom to shower.&nbsp; She quickly showers and gets ready then goes to play with Soojin while Bobby bathes and gets changed.&nbsp; When he emerges from the bathroom, he goes to Soojin&rsquo;s room.&nbsp; &ldquo;Okay ladies, are we ready to go meet guests?&nbsp; And hopefully find out who I am.&rdquo;&nbsp; He says but with the last part said under his breath.&nbsp; They leave to head to the dining room.</p><p>\tThey enter the dining room and Yoongi and Aurora greeting all of the guests.&nbsp; The Min family, as well as the Jungs, Kims, and the Neo clan are all present.&nbsp; All are seated around a very large dining table and the maids have taken the children to the next room to feed them at their own table. &nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;As we all know, next week will begin a new chapter for the Min family.&nbsp; With that being said, there are a few things that need to be clarified.&nbsp; I had Namjoon run some basic DNA tests to clarify true lineage of all of the Mins and their future and current spouses.&nbsp; When royalty is involved a certain amount of pomp and circumstance is expected by the public.&nbsp; We needed to know for sure.&nbsp; Namjoon can you please stand up and read your findings.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yoongi says while standing at the head of the table flanked by CL and yourself.&nbsp; Namjoon has a maid retrieve his briefcase from the living room.&nbsp; She holds it while he removes the necessary documents.&nbsp; He faces the crowd and clears his throat.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Okay so lets get started with the Min family.&nbsp; Genetically the four of you are all predominantly Vampire with a bit of Witch and Nymph DNA in the mix.&nbsp; CL is approximately 85% Vampire, 10% Witch, and 5% Nymph.&nbsp; Yoongi is 65% Vampire, 30 % Witch, and 5 % Nymph.&nbsp; Jungkook is 55% Vampire, 25% Witch, and 20% Nymph.&nbsp; Chanyeol is 60% Vampire, 20% Witch, and 20% Nymph.&nbsp; So while all of you possess powers some of your powers are Witch based and some are Nymph based.&nbsp; Before we burned your father I took a sample from him.&nbsp; He was 75% Vampire and 25% Nymph.&nbsp; So by my conclusions your mother must have had Witch DNA as well as Nymph DNA present.&nbsp; It is normal for Witches to have Nymph DNA present.&rdquo;&nbsp; Namjoon says but pausing to get a drink of wine.</p><p>\t&ldquo;So is CL&rsquo;s DNA the reason why she has always been faster and stronger than me?&rdquo;&nbsp; Yoongi questions.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Yes, she possesses the most Vampire DNA of all of the Min siblings and Jungkook possesses the least amount of Vampire DNA.&nbsp; But moving on to the spouses and future spouses.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s start with Aurora&rsquo;s DNA.&nbsp; We know that she now possesses Vampire DNA but I compared the samples from before with the current samples and found some interesting data.&nbsp; Before, she was 75% Sage Witch, 20% Nephilim, and 5% Unknown.&nbsp; And now, she is 45% Sage Witch, 35% Vampire, and 20% Nephilim.&nbsp; So the only thing I can conclude was that the 5% from before was Vampire DNA but was shielded by her Nephilim DNA.&nbsp; I ran her DNA through the complete data base and only came up with four possible matches; King Taehyung, a Sage witch by the name of Queen Andromeda, a Vampire by the name of Prince Shin Hyun, and strangely enough it matched someone else in this room&hellip;Byun Baekhyun.&nbsp; Let me explain a bit farther.&nbsp; King Taehyung is Aurora&rsquo;s brother, Andromeda was Aurora&rsquo;s grandmother, Prince Shin Hyun was her great grandfather, and Baekhyun is Aurora&rsquo;s cousin through her father and his mother.&nbsp; And with that being said let me move on to Baekhyun.&nbsp; Based on the DNA results you are not a Muse like you were always told you are 45% Nephilim and 55% Werewolf.&nbsp; Your mother was an angel or a Nephilim herself.&rdquo;&nbsp; Namjoon states before getting another sip of his wine. &nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Well, that explains the weird things that have been happening since I arrived here.&nbsp; I guess being this close to another Nephilim has activated something in me.&nbsp; I was raised by wolves and I didn&rsquo;t know my mother.&nbsp; So I am guessing that since I wasn&rsquo;t used to tapping into that part of me; it never manifested until now.&nbsp; This morning I was in the shower and my shoulders started itching.&nbsp; They have been itching ever since.&rdquo;&nbsp; Baekhyun says quietly and calmly.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Come with me.&nbsp; Quickly now. &nbsp; We don&rsquo;t want them to emerge inside.&rdquo;&nbsp; You say as you take his hand.&nbsp; He looks at you confused.&nbsp; &ldquo;You will see.&rdquo;&nbsp; You continue.&nbsp; You lead him to the garden.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now focus on the itch.&nbsp; This is going to hurt but really focus on it.&rdquo;&nbsp; You say as you look at him with a reassuring smile.&nbsp; He focuses on the itch and doubles over yelling.&nbsp; Suddenly the yelling stops and he raises up with two beautiful wings similar to Snow Owls wings.&nbsp; He stays silent for a moment and turns to look at Chanyeol who had followed them concerned for Baekhyun. &nbsp;</p><p>\tChanyeol runs to his husband and embraces him.&nbsp; Chanyeol then kisses him and tells him. &ldquo;They are beautiful just like you.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Okay.&nbsp; Now that you have made them manifest; I need to teach you to conceal them as well as how to use them.&nbsp; Flight lessons will be for another day but for now let&rsquo;s get you to conceal them.&nbsp; Focus on your wolf side now.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t let it come completely out but just under the surface; this should cause your wings to disappear for the time being.&nbsp; I am warning you however as you learn how to use your Nephilim abilities; they could appear with little warning.&rdquo;&nbsp; You say with a warm loving touch on the arm.&nbsp; Baekhyun nods and focuses while staring at his husband.&nbsp; His wings disappear but his eyes have now become a very light brown (almost yellow).&nbsp; The three of you return to the dinner.&nbsp; Namjoon decided to wait for you all to return before continuing. &nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Now that we are all present once again.&nbsp; Let us move on to King Taehyung.&nbsp; Before he was 65% Incubi and 35% Sage Witch and now he is 90% Incubi and 10% Sage Witch.&nbsp; His father was the late King Bogum and his mother was a Sage Witch.&nbsp; He is the rightful heir to the throne of the Incubi/Succubi Community.&nbsp; Now onto Bobby.&nbsp; Bobby, your DNA was unique to say the lease.&nbsp; You are a Kim by birth but you are also next in line for the throne after Taehyung.&nbsp; He is your cousin.&nbsp; You are Prince Ji-Won.&nbsp; The son of Kim Minseo and Prince of the Moon, Prince Joohyun.&nbsp; Prince Joohyun was King Bogum&rsquo;s younger brother.&nbsp; Minseo was Elder Kim&rsquo;s sister; which makes you our cousin as well.&nbsp; So in conclusion, all of the Min weddings this coming week will be royal affairs.&nbsp; The Min&rsquo;s are one of the oldest Royal houses.&nbsp; Although they got rid of the formalities long ago, they are all of royal blood and are all princes and princess.&rdquo;&nbsp; Namjoon states proudly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I would also like to clarify something for Jimin and myself.&nbsp; We were always told that we were Cambian Demons but genetically speaking; I am 5% Cambian, 10% Werewolf, 10% Werecat, and 75% Shapeshifter Demon.&nbsp; Jimin is 5 % Cambian, 10% Werewolf,&nbsp; 10% Werecat, 65% Shapeshifter and 10% Jinn.&nbsp; We are shapeshifters more than anything.&nbsp; And I ran Jin&rsquo;s also,&nbsp; Before he was 65% Jinn and 35% Genie.&nbsp; Now he is, 35% Genie, 10% Jinn, 35% Vampire, 10% Incubi, 5% Werewolf, and 5% Shapeshifter.&nbsp; Due to Seokjin&rsquo;s experiments, Jin has been permanently altered.&nbsp; He will need our help in understanding his abilities as they manifest.&nbsp; He already has a test for blood.&nbsp; And this morning, he shifted into a dog.&nbsp; Even the slightest amount of DNA with is Jinn and Genie blood will cause abilities to manifest.&nbsp; Thank you for your time and patience.&rdquo;&nbsp; Namjoon concludes.&nbsp; \tEveryone continued dinner and went their separate ways; many wanting time to think about the revolutions that were revealed at dinner.&nbsp; As the night wore on, many retreated to the comforts of their home and bedrooms.&nbsp; All but one couple who slowly walked the gardens under the bright full moon.&nbsp; The two lone figures walk hand and hand as the soft lunar light illuminates the beautiful garden.</p><p>\t&ldquo;So you are actually a Prince?&nbsp; Or are you a King now that your father has passed?&rdquo;&nbsp; You ask Yoongi.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I am a Prince.&nbsp; I am Prince of the Blood Moon, Prince Yoongi.&nbsp; CL is Princess of the Harvest Moon, Jungkook is Prince of the New Moon, and Chanyeol is Prince of the Snow Moon.&nbsp;
