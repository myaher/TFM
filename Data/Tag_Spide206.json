You couldn\u2019t say the same thing for your boyfriend\u2026</p><p>Peter was still in high school, granted he was a year younger than you so that did explain why you were a freshman in college and he was still a senior in high school. Even though he was considered a high school student, there were many times when you thought your roles were reversed, due to the fact of how many difficult college level courses your boyfriend was taking. He was already in an AP Physics course as well as AP Chemistry, Calculus, Biology and pretty much any other science course that was offered. You were beyond proud of him, but there were some days that he made you feel down right dumb, but don\u2019t get me wrong, he always made sure that you didn\u2019t feel that way for long (he was sweet that way). </p><p>You walked back to your apartment and smiled ever so slightly when you saw the lights of your living room already peaking through the curtains of your living room window. You knew that meant that Peter had already let himself into your house, granted you gave him a key last month for that very reason. You guys had been together for a year and half at this point, so you figured it was about time you got him a key. </p><p>As you stepped into your small apartment, you took your shoes off at the door and set your backpack down on the kitchen table. You turned to your left to walk into the living room, and that was when you saw the enormous amount of books and papers spread across the floor, table, couch, and your sleeping boyfriend. \u00a0You smiled, but a little bit of concern started to tug at your mind when you started to wonder how long he had been there, surrounded by all the work he still had to do. You went over to him, and lightly shook his shoulder, surprised when his tired brown eyes met your (y/e/c) ones. You giggled as he groaned and slowly sat up, the papers and books that were laying on him previously falling to the ground.</p><p>\u201cYou look like shit.\u201d You stated, the smile on your face starting to tug further and further across your face.</p><p>\u201cGee, thanks for noticing, Captain Obvious,\u201d Peter replied before performing a sad attempt at rubbing the sleep from his eyes. You put your hand on his cheek and lightly rubbed circles on his skin with your thumb.</p><p>\u201cSarcasm\u2026 It must be really bad huh?\u201d You asked, slowly letting the concern for your boyfriend grow as you noticed the differences from his normal behaviour. His eyes closed once more as he lightly moved his head into the palm of your hand, and you noticed the heavy sigh that left his lips moments after.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a lot to handle, (Y/n)&hellip;. If it was just school, then I would be fine.. But it isn\u2019t just school\u2026 I have to make sure that people are safe, I have to what other people can\u2019t because I was given a gift\u2026 and I have lots of tests coming up that I\u2019m actually worried about and I don\u2019t know how to handle all of it\u2026\u201d You gave your boyfriend a sympathetic look before hugging him close to you. You knew that him being the friendly neighborhood Spider-man was slowly starting to take its toll on him, but you also knew that he wouldn\u2019t give it up for anything.</p><p>\u201cHow about you go into the bedroom and lay down for a little bit okay? I think it might help if you actually get a few hours of sleep\u2026\u201d You trailed off before Peter nodded, his eyes becoming droopy once more. </p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026 You\u2019re right\u2026 I love you.\u201d His voice dragged on as he stood up and walked towards the little bedroom that was across the apartment. Once the door was closed, you smiled ever so slightly before picking up all of his papers and putting them in the correct folders and the putting them with their textbooks. You then went into the kitchen and started to make some hot chocolate and sugar cookies- you knew that on days like this sweets always made him feel a little bit better.</p><p>As the cookies were in the oven, you looked out the window to see the snowflakes falling slowly down to the ground, their delicate white coats shimmering against the yellow light streaming from your kitchen. You smiled slightly before walking to your bedroom and crawling in bed with your boyfriend.</p><p>He was mostly unconscious which was why you giggled when he wrapped his arms around you and pulled you close to his chest out of habit. You kissed at his jaw lightly before tracing your fingers on his clothed chest with the lightness of the snowflakes outside. \u201cI made you some cookies and hot chocolate,\u201d You whispered, knowing that Peter was a light sleeper for two things- Crime fighting and sweets.</p><p>One of his eyes shot open to look at you, and noticed the tiny smirk starting to form on his lips. You couldn\u2019t help but giggle as he hugged you even tighter out of delight. That\u2019s when the tickling started, he knew how to get you laughing, so he had made it his mission over the last year and a half to make you laugh every day, because if he was being honest, he loved hearing you laugh. </p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Peter! You want your cookies don\u2019t you?\u201d You giggled before his infamous smile broke out across his face, making butterflies beat their wings against the walls of your stomach. He had always had that effect on you, and that\u2019s part of the reason why you always did everything you could to make him happy. </p><p>You spent the rest of the night eating horrible amounts of sugar cookies, and you even made chocolate chip cookie dough, but it never made it in the oven. You drank your hot chocolate before putting on one of his favorite movies and cuddling on the couch until you *both* fell asleep. Little did you know that he stayed up a few minutes after you fell asleep in his arms.</p><p><b>*Peter\u2019s P.O.V.*</b></p><p>I smiled as I looked down at the woman in my arms. She was one of the most amazing people I had ever met and I still have trouble believing that I am the man that gets a chance to make her happy. </p><p>Her hand tightened ever so slightly on my shirt which made me smirk ever so slightly- she was dreaming, that much I knew. She always did that when she started dreaming, and it was one of the cutest things that I had noticed about her.</p><p>Granted, everything about her is adorable. And she always does everything she can to make me happy, and less stressed, which I didn\u2019t realise until now how much I needed that in my life. </p><p>I kissed her forehead before shutting the TV off and picking her up in my arms before walking both of us into the bedroom, her breathing still soft and steady with sleep. I tucked the woman of my dreams into the warm blankets before sneaking into them myself, my arms finding their way around her waist and I pulled her back close to my chest, my chin flush with the crook of her neck.</p><p>\u201cYou really are perfect, (Y/n)&hellip;\u201d </p><p><b>*Back to normal P.O.V.*</b></p><p>And with that, both of you were brought to dream land and had great dreams about the future you both were looking forward to, especially since both of you saw a future in each others arms. </p>",

You kissed at his jaw lightly before tracing your fingers on his clothed chest with the lightness of the snowflakes outside. \u201cI made you some cookies and hot chocolate,\u201d You whispered, knowing that Peter was a light sleeper for two things- Crime fighting and sweets.</p><p>One of his eyes shot open to look at you, and noticed the tiny smirk starting to form on his lips. You couldn\u2019t help but giggle as he hugged you even tighter out of delight. That\u2019s when the tickling started, he knew how to get you laughing, so he had made it his mission over the last year and a half to make you laugh every day, because if he was being honest, he loved hearing you laugh. </p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Peter! You want your cookies don\u2019t you?\u201d You giggled before his infamous smile broke out across his face, making butterflies beat their wings against the walls of your stomach. He had always had that effect on you, and that\u2019s part of the reason why you always did everything you could to make him happy. </p><p>You spent the rest of the night eating horrible amounts of sugar cookies, and you even made chocolate chip cookie dough, but it never made it in the oven. You drank your hot chocolate before putting on one of his favorite movies and cuddling on the couch until you *both* fell asleep. Little did you know that he stayed up a few minutes after you fell asleep in his arms.</p><p><b>*Peter\u2019s P.O.V.*</b></p><p>I smiled as I looked down at the woman in my arms. She was one of the most amazing people I had ever met and I still have trouble believing that I am the man that gets a chance to make her happy. </p><p>Her hand tightened ever so slightly on my shirt which made me smirk ever so slightly- she was dreaming, that much I knew. She always did that when she started dreaming, and it was one of the cutest things that I had noticed about her.</p><p>Granted, everything about her is adorable. And she always does everything she can to make me happy, and less stressed, which I didn\u2019t realise until now how much I needed that in my life. </p><p>I kissed her forehead before shutting the TV off and picking her up in my arms before walking both of us into the bedroom, her breathing still soft and steady with sleep. I tucked the woman of my dreams into the warm blankets before sneaking into them myself, my arms finding their way around her waist and I pulled her back close to my chest, my chin flush with the crook of her neck.</p><p>\u201cYou really are perfect, (Y/n)\u2026\u201d </p><p><b>*Back to normal P.O.V.*</b></p><p>And with that, both of you were brought to dream land and had great dreams about the future you both were looking forward to, especially since both of you saw a future in each others arms. </p>",

You couldn\u2019t say the same thing for your boyfriend\u2026</p><p>Peter was still in high school, granted he was a year younger than you so that did explain why you were a freshman in college and he was still a senior in high school. Even though he was considered a high school student, there were many times when you thought your roles were reversed, due to the fact of how many difficult college level courses your boyfriend was taking. He was already in an AP Physics course as well as AP Chemistry, Calculus, Biology and pretty much any other science course that was offered. You were beyond proud of him, but there were some days that he made you feel down right dumb, but don\u2019t get me wrong, he always made sure that you didn\u2019t feel that way for long (he was sweet that way). </p><p>You walked back to your apartment and smiled ever so slightly when you saw the lights of your living room already peaking through the curtains of your living room window. You knew that meant that Peter had already let himself into your house, granted you gave him a key last month for that very reason. You guys had been together for a year and half at this point, so you figured it was about time you got him a key. </p><p>As you stepped into your small apartment, you took your shoes off at the door and set your backpack down on the kitchen table. You turned to your left to walk into the living room, and that was when you saw the enormous amount of books and papers spread across the floor, table, couch, and your sleeping boyfriend. \u00a0You smiled, but a little bit of concern started to tug at your mind when you started to wonder how long he had been there, surrounded by all the work he still had to do. You went over to him, and lightly shook his shoulder, surprised when his tired brown eyes met your (y/e/c) ones. You giggled as he groaned and slowly sat up, the papers and books that were laying on him previously falling to the ground.</p><p>\u201cYou look like shit.\u201d You stated, the smile on your face starting to tug further and further across your face.</p><p>\u201cGee, thanks for noticing, Captain Obvious,\u201d Peter replied before performing a sad attempt at rubbing the sleep from his eyes. You put your hand on his cheek and lightly rubbed circles on his skin with your thumb.</p><p>\u201cSarcasm\u2026 It must be really bad huh?\u201d You asked, slowly letting the concern for your boyfriend grow as you noticed the differences from his normal behaviour. His eyes closed once more as he lightly moved his head into the palm of your hand, and you noticed the heavy sigh that left his lips moments after.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a lot to handle, (Y/n)\u2026. If it was just school, then I would be fine.. But it isn\u2019t just school\u2026 I have to make sure that people are safe, I have to what other people can\u2019t because I was given a gift\u2026 and I have lots of tests coming up that I\u2019m actually worried about and I don\u2019t know how to handle all of it\u2026\u201d You gave your boyfriend a sympathetic look before hugging him close to you. You knew that him being the friendly neighborhood Spider-man was slowly starting to take its toll on him, but you also knew that he wouldn\u2019t give it up for anything.</p><p>\u201cHow about you go into the bedroom and lay down for a little bit okay? I think it might help if you actually get a few hours of sleep\u2026\u201d You trailed off before Peter nodded, his eyes becoming droopy once more. </p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026 You\u2019re right\u2026 I love you.\u201d His voice dragged on as he stood up and walked towards the little bedroom that was across the apartment. Once the door was closed, you smiled ever so slightly before picking up all of his papers and putting them in the correct folders and the putting them with their textbooks. You then went into the kitchen and started to make some hot chocolate and sugar cookies- you knew that on days like this sweets always made him feel a little bit better.</p><p>As the cookies were in the oven, you looked out the window to see the snowflakes falling slowly down to the ground, their delicate white coats shimmering against the yellow light streaming from your kitchen.
