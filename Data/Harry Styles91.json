We travelled seven hours to Munich to see Harry live, (Munich was the closest city from Budapest where he went.) and it was truly An Experience\u2122\ufe0f. One of the best experiences in my life.</i></p><p><i>N. x</i></p><p>.</p><p>Seven hours.</p><p>Seven hours were the amount of time I had ahead of me. </p><p>Only time and distance were the border of something to come, something to arrive.</p><p>As I was standing small on almost the edge of this street&rsquo;s pavement,  I couldn&rsquo;t help, but feel melancholic.

I didn&rsquo;t stop  touching his arms, nor stepped away, but I let him breath for sometime  by not hanging in his neck. Literally.</p><p>I locked gaze with him. I could see some golden spots in his irises,  and the pupils were expanded in them. They were black infinite holes  which worked against my will &ndash; and I surrendered immediately.</p><p>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; I heard him saying suddenly. </p><p>His first word for me actually startled me, because I didn&rsquo;t expect  his voice to speak so soon, nor did I ever expect the tone of him being  so soft, so&hellip; honey-like. Sweet, tasty and velvety. So smooth and  inviting to the point I wanted to taste it. To feel it.</p><p>I giggled shyly under his strong gaze, and my grip into the soft  blanket and pillow of mine tightened. I felt a little bit insecure in  front of a beauty like him.</p><p>But I spoke up &ndash; to not to be a loser.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi! So nice to finally meet you,&rdquo;<i> I&rsquo;ve been waiting for this moment for years</i>, I added the truth inside my head.</p><p>His face sparkled under a shy sunlight, my brain couldn&rsquo;t even  function properly. No matter how hard I tried, I could only look at him  fondly.</p><p>What a pretty boy.</p><p>He smiled a little, bit his bottom lip as if he couldn&rsquo;t believe his eyes as well as me. But it was just impossible, wasn&rsquo;t it?</p><p>He only wrapped his long left arm around me as he began to softly  pull towards the white and fancy car of his. He messaged me earlier that  his father let him borrow his favourite car, because &ndash; with his  father&rsquo;s words &ndash; &ldquo;this was a special event&rdquo;.</p><p>This thought made my insides burn and as soon as it appeared in my  mind at random moments I couldn&rsquo;t help the smile which wholeheartedly  was genuine. And huge. Really huge.</p><p>I was afraid I was in love with the boy I hadn&rsquo;t met yet.</p><p>But when he wrapped his arms around me, welcomed me in his warmness, I knew. I knew my feelings towards him were real.</p><p>Real.</p><p>He was a proper gentleman. Rarely believable to be found, but it&rsquo;s  possible: as he hurriedly opened the car&rsquo;s door for me and his face  reminded me of a pretty red rose, I knew. I just knew I was way too  lucky.</p><p>He was way too good to be true.</p><p>Then our journey started.</p><p>The car&rsquo;s engine softly roared, the surroundings changed, but we  stayed still. Him holding my left hand so tight that it actually went  numb. But I didn&rsquo;t mind.</p><p>I enjoyed being important to someone so special. Someone incredible as him.</p><p>The road was long. &nbsp;I made myself comfortable, and beside my numb  hand which was being holden - it was quite okay. It wasn&rsquo;t my bed,  definitely not. But I was with Harry &ndash; with the boy I had been chatting  with for years, who I had made promises of stars and galaxies with. </p><p>Sometimes he pecked the back of my hand, and every time my heart stopped beating for a moment.</p><p>I knew he was my death, but he was my life as well.</p><p>God, was I too dramatic? Too quick to judge? Too foolish?</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>I wanted to live, I wanted to finally feel home, inside someone&rsquo;s  arms, inside a place where I knew I could stay, a place which let me  have some trust. Towards the possibility of goodness. Of bright future,  of beautiful sides that had hid from me all my life.</p><p>We were on the road.</p></p>",

                "content": "<p>If you are asking me whether Harry has ever felt attracted to girls, or whether he&rsquo;s had sex with a woman, I would say it wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if he has. </p><p>The way that Harry talks about sex, and makes sexual innuendos and jokes, makes me think he&rsquo;s a sexually curious person&mdash; open to different experiences, and nonjudgmental of others because he&rsquo;s fairly open himself. </p><p>As far as specific relationships&mdash; I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if these songs alluded to experiences that he&rsquo;s remembered or recorded with women. </p><p>I do feel that he is more attracted to men&mdash; one man in particular with initials LWT. </p><p>I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s ever had a longterm relationship with a woman, the way he was portrayed in <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Famp%2Fs%2Fwww.rollingstone.com%2Fmusic%2Fmusic-features%2Fharry-styles-new-direction-119432%2Famp%2F&amp;t=NDFkNTg1OTU2OTU2ODEwOTY5OGM3YjBiMjkxYTgyMWUzMzhiYjhhYyw1NmI5M2FiOGE1ODdjZTNiN2YzNWU0M2NlMTcxYzQ5YTUzZWM3NjU0\">Cameron Crow&rsquo;s RS profile</a>:</p><p><i>What would a solo Harry Styles sound like? A plan came into focus. <b>A song cycle about women and relationships. </b>Ten songs. More of a rock sound. A bold single-color cover to match the working title: Pink. (He quotes the Clash&rsquo;s Paul Simonon: &ldquo;Pink is the only true rock &amp; roll colour.&rdquo;) Many of the details would change over the coming year &ndash; including the title, which would end up as Harry Styles &ndash; but one word stuck in his head.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Honest,&rdquo; he says, a year later, driving through midcity Los Angeles in a dusty black Range Rover. He&rsquo;s lived here off and on for the past few years, always returning to London. Styles&rsquo; car stereo pumps a mix of country and obscure classic rock. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to write &lsquo;stories,&rsquo;&thinsp;&rdquo; he says. <b>&ldquo;I wanted to write my stories</b>, <b>things that happened to me. The number-one thing was I wanted to be honest. </b>I hadn&rsquo;t done that before.&rdquo; </i></p><p>In a lawyer-y, &ldquo;define girlfriends&rdquo; kind of way, the above is true. The songs are about <i>some</i> women and <i>some</i> of his relationships, just not <i>his</i> relationships <i>with</i> women. </p><p>I think a lot of the album may have been planned in a corporate way. In January 2017, Irving Azoff&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Famp%2Fs%2Fwww.billboard.com%2Famp%2Farticles%2Fbusiness%2F7654288%2Fprince-global-music-rights-gmr-performance-licensing-deal&amp;t=YWM2MTBlOWFlNzI1YmQ3ZDdiNTQ0OTIzMjJjNmE4ZjBkZjI4ODIwNiw2NWQzNThjMmZkNjY1NjRmYzYzN2VhZTQwNTcwZjgxYTAxMmQzNmRh\">Global Music Rights won the rights to license the entire Prince catalogue</a> for performance. Harry&rsquo;s first single, <i>Sign of the Times</i>, is released on 7 April, 2017, thirty years after <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fen.m.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FSign_o%2527_the_Times&amp;t=OGY5Njg4MWE4NWZkZmZmNWE4OGUwMzhhMWNlN2VlZDU0ZGYxMTlmNCxlN2ZhMjQ1MTYxNDdlODZlMTJlN2NmMDhlODQ2ZDlhNGYxYzNmYmYz\">Prince released his <i>Sign o&rsquo; the Times</i> album</a> in 1987, the first album Prince made <i>after he broke from his band</i>, the Revolution. Articles then came out in spades, comparing Harry to Prince and Bowie. Dramatic? Yes. Symbolic? Also yes. </p><p>I have no doubts that Harry wrote a great song (SOTT will stand the test of time), but the coincidence is serendipitous, to say the least, as was the coincidence to play <i>Only Angel</i> at the Victoria Secret Fashion Show (November 2017), and to have a former VS model as a girlfriend (amongst other former Angel ex-gfs), as well as inviting the VS head of publicity as a VIP guest to his Radio City performance. </p><p>My point is that the album contained both very intimate, personal revelations, as well as very carefully scripted, corporate image-building. It&rsquo;s naive now to think otherwise. I think most&mdash; maybe all&mdash; of the ladies who have been linked to Harry (especially since hiatus) have been for public consumption. I think about his songs about women in the same way. For greater revelation, I would look at the songs Harry sings about women with the most emotional candor&mdash; like <i>Girl Crush. </i></p>",

My mind was empty, and I came up with many bullshit ideas and almost settled down with some of them (glad i DIDN&rsquo;T!). Then as I was listening to 1000 Times by Sarah Bareilles, from the lyrics, I pictured two strangers meeting each other for the first time, feeling like they&rsquo;ve known each other forever, but having no clue that they used to be lovers in a different lifetime. It&rsquo;s just so romantic in my head and I knew I could do this idea justice. So thank you Sarah Bareilles, if you read this fic lemme know lmao. The painting idea was originally from Marc Levy&rsquo;s novel with the same name (Idk what it&rsquo;s title in French, but in my translated language it&rsquo;s) In Another Life, so just to be clear I didn&rsquo;t really come up with that, credit to the genius who did. Thank you &ldquo;The Tudors&rdquo; for all this knowledge I have about the English dynasties in the 16th century, and I&rsquo;m genuinely sorry if I offend anyone with all the historical inaccuracies, please forgive me. Thank you everyone who&rsquo;s read and waited and commented on every chapter to help me make this as good as possible. I know it&rsquo;s only fiction but to read about how my writing makes some of you happy and feel better really does make me happy and feel better and motivated to write more.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve had a couple alternative endings to this series, and I think this one is the best (among the others), but if you want to know what the other endings are, feel free to drop me an ask! Or simply tell me what you expected from this chapter before knowing the actual ending here!</p><p>Okay, bye, thank you for putting up with my extra ass! Kissy, Allie.\u2764\ufe0e<br/></p><p>___________________________<br/><br/></p><!-- more --><p>Harry ended up spending the rest of his afternoon chatting with his assigned nurse. He&rsquo;d told the old woman about what had been going on in his life, how he&rsquo;d met Y/N, the dreams he&rsquo;d had ever since his trip to the museum, the faces in those dreams that looked just like her. And even though it did feel nice to finally get all this burden off his chest, he still found it strange that she barely opened up about herself. All he knew about her was that her name was Margaret, or <i>Maggie</i> as she preferred to be called, and she lived alone, no husband, no children, and had been working as a nurse for as long as she could remember. </p><p>&ldquo;I have a feeling that we&rsquo;ve met before,&rdquo; he told her at last because it had been bothering him since they first met.\u00a0</p><p>But the woman just looked at him in surprise as she said she didn&rsquo;t think so.\u00a0&quot;Although, you do remind me of someone I used to know.&ldquo; She studied the look on his face, pondering for a little while.</p><p>&quot;Oh, who is it?&rdquo; He asked.</p><p>&ldquo;I had a niece, she fell madly in love with a young man whom you remind me of.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Had</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&hellip;passed away years ago, unfortunately.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry could see the clear change in her facial expression when she said those words, so he didn&rsquo;t want to dig too deep into that hurtful memory of hers, even though he was curious to know about the man who resembled him. However, it was Maggie who continued with this topic he thought she wanted to avoid.</p><p>&ldquo;That young man was very passionate about my dear Annalise as you are for the girl you love.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Her name was Annalise?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, it means <i>Grace of God</i>. I helped her mother pick that name.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very beautiful, ma'am.&rdquo; Harry pressed his lips into a smile when he saw how hers was beaming as she talked about her beloved niece. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Annalise and her man were very happy together?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. They never got together.&rdquo; Maggie shook her head slowly. &ldquo;His family didn&rsquo;t want him to be with her and he didn&rsquo;t have a choice.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So after she&hellip;uhm&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Passed away?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, after she passed away, what happened to him?&rdquo;</p><p>There was a long pause as the old lady&rsquo;s eyes shifted to her feet, and Harry felt like he never should&rsquo;ve asked that question. He took a wild guess that the young man must&rsquo;ve had the same tragic ending as the girl, if that was true, then this was definitely the most heartbreaking story he&rsquo;d heard in a long time.</p><p>&ldquo;He moved on, married the girl his family wanted him to marry, but he never stopped loving her. He died of a heart attack, and his last word was her name.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry felt a lump in his throat and he had no idea why. He was really hurting over a story of two strangers whom he knew nothing about. His faith in true love had always been faint, after hearing this he had completely lost hope. </p><p>&ldquo;Had the timing been different, they could&rsquo;ve ended up together,&rdquo; he said, breaking the melancholy silence that had taken over the atmosphere surrounding them. </p><p>Maggie released a long heavyhearted sigh as she crossed her legs and leaned back against the chair. She stopped to think for a moment, then she told him, &ldquo;but I like to think they&rsquo;ll meet each other and start again in another life. Because true love never dies. Do you agree?&rdquo;</p><p>No. Harry didn&rsquo;t. </p><p>He thought people had had enough chances in one lifetime already and God wouldn&rsquo;t be so merciful to offer endless trials for them to try and fix their mistakes again and again, lifetime after lifetime. Despite so, he still told Maggie he agreed with her and added, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have my fingers crossed for the two of them.&rdquo;</p><p>As he was about to move on to another, more cheerful topic to discuss, the old lady spoke up again, &ldquo;she wrote him a letter every single day they&rsquo;d spent together.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, did he get a chance to read them?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He did. I gave them to him myself. He was very emotional, he burst into tears.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wow&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Before he passed away he gave them back to me.&rdquo; Maggie rose from the chair by his hospital bed and went to grab her purse, which sat on the table by the window. &ldquo;I have them with me here, do you want to read them?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You bring them with you to work?&rdquo; </p><p>The perplexity on his face made her smile as she pulled out a pile of papers which seemed pretty old, they&rsquo;d turned to a yellowish brown and were all a bit torn at the edges. &ldquo;I was moving to a new home today so I brought them with me, I don&rsquo;t want to put them with the rest of the other stuff in my flat, they&rsquo;re very fragile.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I should read them, they&rsquo;re very personal, ma'am.&rdquo; Harry shook his head when she gave the letters to him.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an artist, aren&rsquo;t you? Maybe these love letters will inspire you in your songwriting. And I know my darling Ann would love to share them with people who have the same heart as the man she loved.&rdquo;</p><p>Did she just say <i>Ann</i>? That was the name Harry had heard many times in his dreams about Y/N. But he could be wrong.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna leave them here for you to read. You have nothing fun to do around here anyway,&rdquo; Maggie chuckled then walked away from his bed, not expecting a reply from her confused patient.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p><i>Madam Maggie told Edward </i><i>she&rsquo;d come to him because of</i><i> Ann</i><i>. She&rsquo;s</i><i> asked her to. Before the fire incident, Ann had a bad feeling, which she just assumed had something to do with Edward marrying someone else. Little did she know, that bad feeling she&rsquo;d thought was insignificant ended up costing her her own life. </i></p><p><i>In her despair, the poor girl had snuck outside of the castle to see Madam Maggie and asked for two little favors. Thanked to Ann&rsquo;s favors, Madam Maggie showed up just in time to find an unconscious Edward lying on the floor of his chamber.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Her powers allowed her to detect sickness, she knew you had a weak heart, which was also why you fainted earlier. She didn&rsquo;t have the heart to tell you, so she came to see me.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Ann asked you to cure me?&rdquo; Edward inquired, placing a hand on the left side of his chest, only to get disappointed by the answer he received from this woman.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I can make you feel </i><i>less pain</i><i>, but I don&rsquo;t think I can cure you completely. Witches can fix broken bones and mend wounds, but we cannot magic away something so permanent like the heart disease you&rsquo;ve carried since the day you were born.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Edward nodded understandingly. He seemed so unbothered for someone who had just found out his heart had been unwell since his birth. That was when you know he was, in entirety, </i><b><i>wrecked</i></b><i>. Ann&rsquo;s death had caused him such pain that nothing else, not even a stab in the gut by the sharpest blade would be able to hurt him that much.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;On the night we met, she fixed the wound on my leg,&rdquo; he said with a fractured grin and tears in his emerald eyes. &ldquo;And I was supposed to be afraid of her, that was the first time in my life I&rsquo;d ever seen witchcraft.&rdquo; He chuckled but there was no humor in the sound of it, just utter desolation. &ldquo;But the look in her eyes made me feel safe&hellip;and suddenly I wasn&rsquo;t afraid anymore. I knew she was a good person.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;She said the same thing about you. She really loved you.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;And I let her down&hellip;Maybe&hellip;Maybe this sickness should just kill me so I can finally be with her.&rdquo; He took a long pause and shifted his eyes to the window by his bed, sucking in a long breath while contemplating whether or not he should say this out loud. He thought he should. &ldquo;Before you got here, I nearly jumped out of that window.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Madam Maggie calmly asked as if she&rsquo;d already known, both what he&rsquo;d tried to do, and the reason he&rsquo;d chosen </i><b><i>not</i></b><i> to do it.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I made a promise to Ann that I would be a good King. I have to live to fulfill that promise.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good that you&rsquo;re still thinking straight.&rdquo; The woman flashed a smile, reaching out to hold his hand which laid lifelessly by his unresponsive body. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t told you the real reason I&rsquo;m here. Ann also asked me another favor.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; He asked. </i></p><p><i>Madam Maggie thought that this was the most alive he&rsquo;d looked since she first saw him. She confided, &ldquo;did you know she&rsquo;d been writing you letters?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;N-No&hellip;&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;She had. Everyday, from the first day she set foot in this castle, to the night before they locked her away. She felt something bad was gonna happen so she brought them to me and asked me to keep them for a while. She told me she&rsquo;d come back for them, hopefully with you by her side. She was very sure that you two would end up running away together.&rdquo; When she finished that sentence, Madam Maggie couldn&rsquo;t control her emotions anymore. Tears started to shed from her eyes, running down the crinkles at the corners of her chapped lips to land onto her worn out dress. Edward squeezed her hand a bit tighter, as he could deeply sympathize with her loss. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Before she left she gave me a kiss on the cheek&hellip;Like she always did whenever we said goodbye&hellip;I didn&rsquo;t think\u2014&rdquo; That sentence was never finished for the old woman couldn&rsquo;t speak anymore. She began sobbing into the palm of her other hand. And Edward did as well. It was the first time he&rsquo;d really cried ever since he last saw her, and he thought the agony he was feeling then would be his life sentence.</i></p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>Harry woke up, gasping for air,<i> again</i>.</p><p>He was back in his hospital room, the only sound other than his own ragged breathing and riotous heartbeats was the beeping of one of the machines placed beside his bed. This time, he had a dream about Y/N stuck in a burning house, he risked his own life to run inside to save her but she couldn&rsquo;t come with him. So he held her close and let the flame swallow them whole. The dreams he&rsquo;d been having had become more real recently, and he guessed his mild fear of the hospital had something to do with it. Fortunately, Harry wouldn&rsquo;t have to stay there much longer. The doctors had said, for some reasons they could not explain, his heart&rsquo;s condition had been slowly going back to normal, as if it&rsquo;d healed on its own. By this time tomorrow, he could finally be home. </p><p>Harry propped himself up on his elbows then reached out to grab the glass of water his nurse had left on the bedside table. That was when he saw the pile of letters she&rsquo;d put right under it. He slowly sat up, finishing his water, putting the empty glass back on the table, then with a little bit of hesitation, he took the letters and brought them to his lap. </p><p>When Harry scanned his eyes through the first line, which was the date, he almost thought his eyes were mistaken. The year was <i>1509</i>, which was <i>510 years </i>ago! Was this supposed to be a joke? Or was it just a thing this girl Annalise always did with her lover? Maybe it was a secret message only they knew. Now, Harry couldn&rsquo;t put the letters down without finishing every single one of them. </p><p>So Harry began to read, <i>every </i>single word. It took him only halfway through the first letter to realize this wasn&rsquo;t from just <i>&lsquo;a few years ago&rsquo; </i>like Maggie had said. This was a letter from a peasant girl named Ann written to a Prince, Edward Rammour, no other than the man in the portrait, in the museum where the series of strange events and bizarre dreams of Harry&rsquo;s started. </p><p>The girl, Ann, wrote about their first met, about their little moments together, about the look in his eyes when he looked at her, about the things he said that he didn&rsquo;t pay attention to but she remembered every single word. And Harry knew every single detail in here, he&rsquo;d seen them countless of times in his dreams, in which the girl who was supposed to be Ann, looked like Y/N. But the last few letters were all from her point of view so he didn&rsquo;t know what was gonna happen. She talked about not being able to see him as much, about doubting his love for her, about believing in his love for her again when he snuck out to visit her one night, about the things people in the castle said about her even in her presence, about a princess named Emili\u00e9 who was betrothed to the Prince and hated her deeply, about receiving his letter one night asking her to meet him in the library. And in the last paragraph of the <i>very</i> last letter, she wrote about how happy she was because she believed they were gonna run away together. Harry&rsquo;s heart wrenched in anguish for he knew that wasn&rsquo;t what had happened. </p><p>In a millisecond, all the lost memories flooded back to him. Harry now remembered. <i>Everything</i>. </p><p>He remembered her screaming and shouting and begging him to save her and not let them take her away, and he didn&rsquo;t save her, he watched them take her away. He remembered saying goodbye to her one last time. He remembered the look on her face before the door shut between them, He remembered telling her he loved her, <i>forever</i>, and so he did. He loved her forever.</p><p>He remembered everything.</p><p>And on the hospital bed, he burst into tears, and those tears fell down and blurred out the handwriting of the girl who&rsquo;d been dead for hundreds of years, yet kept alive inside his heart.</p><p>&ldquo;Little Annalise had always preferred to be called Ann.&rdquo;</p><p>He lifted his head quickly and saw Maggie at the door. He didn&rsquo;t ask her to explain, he <i>already</i> knew what was going on. &ldquo;Is Y/N&hellip;is she&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>she is</i>.&rdquo; The woman gave him a nod. &ldquo;Did you feel strange when you looked into her eyes?&rdquo; He did. &ldquo;The eyes are the windows to a person&rsquo;s soul. That was why when you looked into hers, as well as&hellip;your own&hellip;in that painting in the museum, you felt a sense of familiarity that you couldn&rsquo;t explain. Same souls, trapped in two different bodies&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How is this even possible?&rdquo; Harry grimaced, trying to put two and two together on his own, but it wasn&rsquo;t that simple. &ldquo;Why are there only two of us? Do the other&hellip;Does this happen to them too? How are you still alive?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the head witch, I&rsquo;m<i> immortal</i>. Not even fire could kill me,&rdquo; she said, smiling as she approached his bed and sat down on the chair where she&rsquo;d sat earlier.</p><p>Taking in a deep breath, she began, &ldquo;when a person dies, their soul breaks into tiny pieces and each creates a new life and they start again, as different people, with no memories of their past lives. However, Ann put a spell on you, or <i>both of you </i>to be exact, to keep your soul from unraveling, and also <i>connected </i>to each other. So you&rsquo;ll come across each other in every single lifetime, not knowing you&rsquo;re each other&rsquo;s <i>soulmates</i>. You&rsquo;ve had many chances to start over again, but this is the closest you&rsquo;ve ever got to the ending she wanted you two to have.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why did it take me until today, <i>this </i>lifetime, to remember?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because it took me<i> that</i> many centuries to have found you.&rdquo; Maggie sighed. &ldquo;I usually found Ann first, but as there are more and more people on the Earth nowadays, it&rsquo;s really difficult to track her down. Every time I arrived in the past, it was already too late. But this time, I guess God does show some mercy after all. He brought me to you instead.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;So you working here is all a coincidence.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A <i>magical</i> coincidence. I almost didn&rsquo;t believe it when I saw you here.&rdquo; She showed him a smile. And even though Harry had calmed down by now, he was still in shock. &ldquo;Edward asked me to give you these letters, he thought only them would help you remember.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;W-Why should I remember if&hellip;if every time we got together one of us died?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because <i>only </i>when you remember, would this story be over.&rdquo;</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Are you sure you want me to have them?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Edward nodded, pushing the letters into Madam Maggie&rsquo;s hand as he insisted, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re the only hope for me to find her.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>She really was. Madam Maggie said once Ann had reincarnated into a new </i><i>body</i><i>, she would be able to feel her, and even if it might take a lot of effort to find her and convince her to believe she was Ann, it was </i><i>possible</i><i>. </i></p><p><i>Honestly, </i><i>Edward</i><i> didn&rsquo;t really believe in life after death. But he hadn&rsquo;t believed in witches until he met Ann, and she was real. Sometimes he still wished she hadn&rsquo;t been real. Maybe if she&rsquo;d been a dream, a beautiful dream, then he would just sleep forever and never wake up.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;But how did you know it was the only way to break the spell?&rdquo; He asked Madam Maggie, eyes on the letters. She could sense the sound of fear and doubt in his trembling voice.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I just knew when you first told me, dear.&rdquo; She put a hand on his shoulder to reassure him. &ldquo;She said it herself, only when you&rsquo;ve found her in another life, could you two finally be together.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Edward exhaled though his mouth as recalled his lover&rsquo;s last words. She did say so, after she&rsquo;d kissed him. </i><b><i>The kiss.</i></b><i> He realized it now! That kiss was when she put a spell on them both!</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Destiny is a funny thing, it&rsquo;s like a chess game, if you can&rsquo;t win, you lose.&rdquo; Madam Maggie took a deep breath and slowly let it all out. &ldquo;Destiny wants to keep you two apart, so it will make sure you two are forever kept apart no matter what. Ann tried to break the rules, so by finding her she meant, you, </i><b><i>finding Ann</i></b><i>, not whoever she&rsquo;d be in the next lifetime, or many after that. If you fail to recognize her but still try to break the rules by being with her, then destiny does what it has to, history repeats itself. One of you will pay the price.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Edward opened his mouth to ask another question, yet Madam Maggie shushed him right before he could release a single sound. &ldquo;You should get some rest, your coronation is tomorrow.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Then she walked away, disappeared into the darkness of the long corridor. And that was also the last time he ever saw her.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Edward! Wait, darling!&rdquo; The voice caught Edward&rsquo;s attention, and he turned around, wishing he hadn&rsquo;t. His mother ran up to him, sounding so desperate as she pleaded, &ldquo;darling, we need to talk!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;No, we don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said coldly and started walking away. But she chased after him and managed to grab him by the arm.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I understand that you don&rsquo;t want to speak to your wife but I am\u2014&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s </i><i>not</i><i> my wife!&rdquo; He shouted, but the frightened look on her face made him weak</i><i> again</i><i>. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a title. Tomorrow she might be the Queen of England, but she will </i><b><i>never </i></b><i>be my wife.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You cannot say that! You have to give her a chance! You need a son to rule after you!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want a son so he would grow up with a mother like </i><i>that</i><i>. I don&rsquo;t want him to suffer the same way I am.&rdquo; Edward hoped those words did hurt the Queen, he hoped the pain shown on her face was genuine. However, he didn&rsquo;t know anymore, he didn&rsquo;t believe in it. Was there anything, or anyone in this castle, &rsquo;</i><i>genuine&rsquo;</i><i>? &ldquo;</i><i>Emili\u00e9 </i><i>had told me everything, mother. You sent Ann in there&hellip;knowing father could hurt her. You were willing to destroy a young girl&rsquo;s life just to make sure I&rsquo;d stay for the throne. Now I am King, are you happy now?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I did it because I love you!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You, same as </i><i>Emili\u00e9</i><i>, same as father, love </i><i>no one</i><i> but yoursel</i><i>f</i><i>!&rdquo; Each and every one of those word was a knife pierced right through his chest. &ldquo;The only one who&rsquo;s ever loved me for me, and not who I am, or going to be, was Ann, and now she&rsquo;s </i><b><i>dead</i></b><i>.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I am still your mother&hellip;&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You are not.&rdquo; He shook his head slowly, trying not to cry because she wasn&rsquo;t worth anymore of his tears. He&rsquo;d suffered enough. &ldquo;I </i><i>loved</i><i> you, I really </i><i>loved</i><i> you.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i><b>Loved. </b>The sound of it crushed the Queen&rsquo;s dark heart into dust, and she thought she might collapse onto the floor had she been able to feel any of her muscle. She was frozen right where she stood, eyes wide, jaw dropped, heartbroken, staring at the son she&rsquo;d let down. They could&rsquo;ve just continued to stand there until sunrise</i><i>, </i><i>had the conversation been interrupted by the arrival of the Chief Minister.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;There you are, Your Highness!&rdquo; Exclaimed the man, who sounded so </i><i>thrilled </i><i>since he didn&rsquo;t know what was happening here. &ldquo;I already had everything you asked prepared for the coronation tomorrow morning. Also Piersilvio, the famous Italian painter, he wanted to paint your portrait as a gif</i><i>t</i><i>. He would arrive at court soon after the ceremony.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo; Edward nodded as he exhaled sharply. &ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;No, Your Highness.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s</i><b><i> 'Your Majesty&rsquo; </i></b><i>to you now.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Yes&hellip;My apologies&hellip;Your Majesty&hellip;&rdquo; The Chief Minister hung his head to show respect to the new young King as he was startled by the change in Edward&rsquo;s attitude. He was afraid he might been in trouble for addressing the monarch in the wrong way, but Edward didn&rsquo;t pay much attention to it.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Have a good evening, His Excellency. Could you please escort the Queen Mother back to her bed chamber?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Yes, Your Majesty.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>When Edward absented himself, he heard his mother desperately screaming out his name, begging him to forgive her. However, he turned a deaf ear to all the things she said. He was no different from a dead man walking.</i></p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>There were indeed plenty of museums in London, more than 170 of them. Countless of visitors came and went every single day. What were the chances of two person returning to the same museum, every single day, to sit in front of the same painting? Surely very little. </p><p>For the first few days the pair were there, nobody really noticed. For almost <i>two weeks</i>, they began to. Everyday before the museum was closed, a young man and a young woman would arrive and stare at the portrait of Edward Rammour, and then they left when everyone else did. Some people thought they were lovers who shared the same passion with art, some said they were sad, depressed, and lonely, some said they were crazy. However, nobody actually came and asked them what their story was. Maybe if someone had, they would&rsquo;ve told them.</p><p>&ldquo;How long are you gonna keep tormenting yourself?&rdquo; Asked Jason as he sat down by his best friend&rsquo;s side on the bench in front of the painting and handed her a donut, which she refused.</p><p>&ldquo;Until I get my memories back&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s impossible.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; She snorted. &ldquo;I think I just need a bit more time with this painting, and it&rsquo;ll all come back to me. <i>She</i> wanted me to remember. That was why she cursed me as well.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t really know what she wanted.&rdquo; Jason heaved a sigh. &ldquo;Maybe she wanted the King to pay for his mistake by cursing him, but she didn&rsquo;t think about how it would also affect her in her new lives.&rdquo;</p><p>That theory seemed justifying, but Y/N knew it wasn&rsquo;t the truth. People wouldn&rsquo;t want themselves to be bound together for eternity with someone they loathed. She knew the woman she used to be still loved the King despite it all. If only she could remember what had really happened.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s back in London you know,&rdquo; Jason broke the silence between the two of them, hand reaching out to hold hers. He thought she might pull away like many times before, but this time she didn&rsquo;t. She stayed still where she was, emotionless, unbothered. &ldquo;Have you listened to his new song? It&rsquo;s about you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have. I love it. I wish I could tell him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You should reach out to him&hellip;if you want to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, you know I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; The lump in her throat when she thought about him made it hard for her to breathe. &ldquo;Not until I know how to break the curse. If we tried to be together, there would be consequences.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re gonna spend your entire life, sitting in front of this painting, trying to remember a life you had&hellip;five centuries ago?&rdquo;</p><p>A simple &ldquo;yes&rdquo; was her answer. And Jason knew nothing else to say. He wanted what was best for her, and he thought separating her from Harry would fix everything. But everything became worse. She&rsquo;d been losing sleep, her nightmares got more real and hard to wake up from. Still her memories of her past life were still dust in a desert. </p><p>Jason asked her if she was thirsty, she said no, but he said he would go buy her something to drink anyway. He then laid a kiss on her cheek and stood up to go. She was once again left alone. Actually, she <i>wasn&rsquo;t </i>alone.</p><p>She could feel him near. She didn&rsquo;t even need to turn around to know he was there. She just did. And she was afraid to look because her feelings could be wrong, and if he wasn&rsquo;t standing right behind her she would be so disappointed. That was when his voice rang right through her ear. The first thing he said wasn&rsquo;t<i> 'hi&rsquo; </i>or <i>'hello&rsquo;</i> or <i>'how have you been?&rsquo;</i> Or even her name. </p><p>It was, <i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found you.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Y/N rose from the bench to turn around, facing Harry at last. He was wearing an expensive trench coat, hands in its pockets, his grey flat cap made sure half of his face was covered, but there was no way she could mistaken him with anyone else. Time seemed to stop when they locked eyes, and for the first time in what seemed like forever, she felt something she&rsquo;d never felt before. She parted her lips, wanting to speak, yet no word escaped for she had no idea what to say. He said he&rsquo;d found her, but she knew he didn&rsquo;t mean finding her, here, in this museum, it was something else, almost like\u2014</p><p>&ldquo;Of course you don&rsquo;t remember&hellip;I&hellip;uhm\u2014&rdquo; he mumbled, as if he was talking to himself. Then a dimpled smile crept up on his face only to vanish as soon as Jason returned with a bottle of water for Y/N. </p><p>She didn&rsquo;t know what was going on in Harry&rsquo;s mind at that point, and Harry didn&rsquo;t say a word either. He turned his heels just as Jason recognized him, and quickly made tracks to the nearest exit.</p><p>Her eyes quickly followed his familiar figure to that door over there, then all the sounds around her became muted at once. She didn&rsquo;t even hear Jason asking her what had just happened, instead she heard Harry&rsquo;s footsteps echoing inside the walls of her brain as they were fading away. He spun his head and sent her one last look before the door was closed between the two of them. Time stopped. It wasn&rsquo;t Harry that she saw. </p><p>She saw <i>Edward</i>.</p><p>She saw him being dragged away from her by the men in amours. She heard her own deafening screams as well as his. She saw the flames on the torches on the brick walls mirroring in his green eyes. She saw him mouthing the words <i>'I love you&rsquo; </i>to her. The door shut between them two, and she snapped back to reality. Everything vanished. The room, the guards, the flames, the torches, <i>him</i>.</p><p>She remembered it now, <i>everything</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N! Y/N! Where are you going?!&rdquo; Jason shouted after her as she started running fast, pushing her way through a crowd of tourists, who screamed at her for being so rude. Then she burst through that door and she screamed out his name, causing many heads to turn around. There was only one face among them that mattered. </p><p>When she saw him she didn&rsquo;t hesitate. Hell, she&rsquo;d been waiting for this moment for too long, <i>500 years</i>! Now, she could finally fall into his embrace. Her head against his chest, and she was finally <i>home</i>.</p><p>Shocked as he was, Harry didn&rsquo;t resist the hug. He chose to ignore all the judging stares they were receiving and clung onto her, eyes squeezed shut, lips pressed to her forehead.</p><p>&ldquo;Why did you walk away?&rdquo; She pulled back to look up at him with a pucker between her brows, all out of breath, yet laughing uncontrollably. </p><p>&ldquo;You were&hellip;with someone else&hellip;&rdquo; He sounded hurt and confused, it only made her laugh harder.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my best friend Jason, you&rsquo;ve met him before, remember?&rdquo; she cried out, voice trembling because she&rsquo;d never been so happy that she choked on her own words. &ldquo;I was waiting for <i>you</i>. I&rsquo;ve been waiting for you for <i>so long</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, so you&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I remember.&rdquo; She nodded fast, arms tightened around his waist. &ldquo;I remember exactly what was going through my head in that tower. I remember feeling so scared when I was on the stake. I remember the last image in my head was you. I remember&hellip;telling you to find me in another life so we could finally be together&hellip;And you did, Harry you found me.<i>&rdquo;</i></p><p>When she touched his face, Harry felt as if there was magic on her fingertips. He dug his nose into her palm, sniffing away his own tears as he wiped away the ones that were rolling down her cheeks. He heard the sound of the camera shutter somewhere behind her, behind him, on his left, and his right, knowing their reunion could&rsquo;ve already made the news already, yet he couldn&rsquo;t care less.</p><p>&ldquo;How did you know I was here?&rdquo; She asked, still cupping his cheeks with no intention of letting him go.</p><p>&ldquo;I came to your house and Lisa told me.&rdquo; He paused. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry it took me so long. I needed over a week to think of what to say to you before coming here so I wouldn&rsquo;t sound insane&hellip;I even brought your letters\u2014&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How do you have the letters?&rdquo; Her eyes grew wide, mouth slightly opened. &ldquo;Wait, have you&hellip;have you met <i>her</i>?&rdquo; Y/N felt like her heart could burst from joy when he nodded his head, telling her yes. &ldquo;Where is she?! Is she here?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, but I&rsquo;ll take you to her, love. She really misses you,&rdquo; he told her while looking around and spotting a couple sneaky paparazzi. So he locked his fingers around her wrist and urged her to come with him and get out of here so they could finally tell each other everything that had happened.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, wait!&rdquo; Y/N tugged on his arm when he was about to pull her with him. &ldquo;I&hellip;I need you to kiss me now so I can be sure neither of us is gonna die.&rdquo;</p><p>Her pretentious fear made Harry burst into laughter. With no hesitation, he cupped her cheeks with both hands, bringing his face down to hers so the tips of their noses brushed against each other, then with their lips only one breath apart, he whispered to her, <i>&ldquo;queen of my heart.&rdquo;</i></p><p>He kissed her exactly how she wanted to be kissed, like it was their first, last, everything they had left to lose. This passionate and timeless moment put an official end to the series of misery that had lasted for five centuries long. And people who walked past King Edward&rsquo;s portrait that day could swear when they told the story, of how they saw the man in the painting, <i>smile</i>.</p>",

Kissy, Allie.\u2764\ufe0e<br></p><p>___________________________<br><br></p>[[MORE]]<p>Harry ended up spending the rest of his afternoon chatting with his assigned nurse. He\u2019d told the old woman about what had been going on in his life, how he\u2019d met Y/N, the dreams he\u2019d had ever since his trip to the museum, the faces in those dreams that looked just like her. And even though it did feel nice to finally get all this burden off his chest, he still found it strange that she barely opened up about herself. All he knew about her was that her name was Margaret, or <i>Maggie</i> as she preferred to be called, and she lived alone, no husband, no children, and had been working as a nurse for as long as she could remember. </p><p>\u201cI have a feeling that we\u2019ve met before,\u201d he told her at last because it had been bothering him since they first met.\u00a0</p><p>But the woman just looked at him in surprise as she said she didn\u2019t think so.\u00a0\"Although, you do remind me of someone I used to know.\u201c She studied the look on his face, pondering for a little while.</p><p>\"Oh, who is it?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cI had a niece, she fell madly in love with a young man whom you remind me of.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Had</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2026passed away years ago, unfortunately.\u201d</p><p>Harry could see the clear change in her facial expression when she said those words, so he didn\u2019t want to dig too deep into that hurtful memory of hers, even though he was curious to know about the man who resembled him. However, it was Maggie who continued with this topic he thought she wanted to avoid.</p><p>\u201cThat young man was very passionate about my dear Annalise as you are for the girl you love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer name was Annalise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it means <i>Grace of God</i>. I helped her mother pick that name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery beautiful, ma'am.\u201d Harry pressed his lips into a smile when he saw how hers was beaming as she talked about her beloved niece. \u201cI\u2019m sure Annalise and her man were very happy together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. They never got together.\u201d Maggie shook her head slowly. \u201cHis family didn\u2019t want him to be with her and he didn\u2019t have a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo after she\u2026uhm\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cPassed away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, after she passed away, what happened to him?\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause as the old lady\u2019s eyes shifted to her feet, and Harry felt like he never should\u2019ve asked that question. He took a wild guess that the young man must\u2019ve had the same tragic ending as the girl, if that was true, then this was definitely the most heartbreaking story he\u2019d heard in a long time.</p><p>\u201cHe moved on, married the girl his family wanted him to marry, but he never stopped loving her. He died of a heart attack, and his last word was her name.\u201d</p><p>Harry felt a lump in his throat and he had no idea why. He was really hurting over a story of two strangers whom he knew nothing about. His faith in true love had always been faint, after hearing this he had completely lost hope. </p><p>\u201cHad the timing been different, they could\u2019ve ended up together,\u201d he said, breaking the melancholy silence that had taken over the atmosphere surrounding them. </p><p>Maggie released a long heavyhearted sigh as she crossed her legs and leaned back against the chair. She stopped to think for a moment, then she told him, \u201cbut I like to think they\u2019ll meet each other and start again in another life. Because true love never dies. Do you agree?\u201d</p><p>No. Harry didn\u2019t. </p><p>He thought people had had enough chances in one lifetime already and God wouldn\u2019t be so merciful to offer endless trials for them to try and fix their mistakes again and again, lifetime after lifetime. Despite so, he still told Maggie he agreed with her and added, \u201cI\u2019ll have my fingers crossed for the two of them.\u201d</p><p>As he was about to move on to another, more cheerful topic to discuss, the old lady spoke up again, \u201cshe wrote him a letter every single day they\u2019d spent together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, did he get a chance to read them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did. I gave them to him myself. He was very emotional, he burst into tears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore he passed away he gave them back to me.\u201d Maggie rose from the chair by his hospital bed and went to grab her purse, which sat on the table by the window. \u201cI have them with me here, do you want to read them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bring them with you to work?\u201d </p><p>The perplexity on his face made her smile as she pulled out a pile of papers which seemed pretty old, they\u2019d turned to a yellowish brown and were all a bit torn at the edges. \u201cI was moving to a new home today so I brought them with me, I don\u2019t want to put them with the rest of the other stuff in my flat, they\u2019re very fragile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I should read them, they\u2019re very personal, ma'am.\u201d Harry shook his head when she gave the letters to him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an artist, aren\u2019t you? Maybe these love letters will inspire you in your songwriting. And I know my darling Ann would love to share them with people who have the same heart as the man she loved.\u201d</p><p>Did she just say <i>Ann</i>? That was the name Harry had heard many times in his dreams about Y/N. But he could be wrong.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna leave them here for you to read. You have nothing fun to do around here anyway,\u201d Maggie chuckled then walked away from his bed, not expecting a reply from her confused patient.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p><i>Madam Maggie told Edward </i><i>she\u2019d come to him because of</i><i> Ann</i><i>. She\u2019s</i><i> asked her to. Before the fire incident, Ann had a bad feeling, which she just assumed had something to do with Edward marrying someone else. Little did she know, that bad feeling she\u2019d thought was insignificant ended up costing her her own life. </i></p><p><i>In her despair, the poor girl had snuck outside of the castle to see Madam Maggie and asked for two little favors. Thanked to Ann\u2019s favors, Madam Maggie showed up just in time to find an unconscious Edward lying on the floor of his chamber.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHer powers allowed her to detect sickness, she knew you had a weak heart, which was also why you fainted earlier. She didn\u2019t have the heart to tell you, so she came to see me.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnn asked you to cure me?\u201d Edward inquired, placing a hand on the left side of his chest, only to get disappointed by the answer he received from this woman.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI can make you feel </i><i>less pain</i><i>, but I don\u2019t think I can cure you completely. Witches can fix broken bones and mend wounds, but we cannot magic away something so permanent like the heart disease you\u2019ve carried since the day you were born.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Edward nodded understandingly. He seemed so unbothered for someone who had just found out his heart had been unwell since his birth. That was when you know he was, in entirety, </i><b><i>wrecked</i></b><i>. Ann\u2019s death had caused him such pain that nothing else, not even a stab in the gut by the sharpest blade would be able to hurt him that much.</i></p><p><i>\u201cOn the night we met, she fixed the wound on my leg,\u201d he said with a fractured grin and tears in his emerald eyes. \u201cAnd I was supposed to be afraid of her, that was the first time in my life I\u2019d ever seen witchcraft.\u201d He chuckled but there was no humor in the sound of it, just utter desolation. \u201cBut the look in her eyes made me feel safe\u2026and suddenly I wasn\u2019t afraid anymore. I knew she was a good person.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cShe said the same thing about you. She really loved you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnd I let her down\u2026Maybe\u2026Maybe this sickness should just kill me so I can finally be with her.\u201d He took a long pause and shifted his eyes to the window by his bed, sucking in a long breath while contemplating whether or not he should say this out loud. He thought he should. \u201cBefore you got here, I nearly jumped out of that window.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you?\u201d Madam Maggie calmly asked as if she\u2019d already known, both what he\u2019d tried to do, and the reason he\u2019d chosen </i><b><i>not</i></b><i> to do it.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI made a promise to Ann that I would be a good King. I have to live to fulfill that promise.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s good that you\u2019re still thinking straight.\u201d The woman flashed a smile, reaching out to hold his hand which laid lifelessly by his unresponsive body. \u201cI haven\u2019t told you the real reason I\u2019m here. Ann also asked me another favor.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d He asked. </i></p><p><i>Madam Maggie thought that this was the most alive he\u2019d looked since she first saw him. She confided, \u201cdid you know she\u2019d been writing you letters?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cN-No\u2026\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cShe had. Everyday, from the first day she set foot in this castle, to the night before they locked her away. She felt something bad was gonna happen so she brought them to me and asked me to keep them for a while. She told me she\u2019d come back for them, hopefully with you by her side. She was very sure that you two would end up running away together.\u201d When she finished that sentence, Madam Maggie couldn\u2019t control her emotions anymore. Tears started to shed from her eyes, running down the crinkles at the corners of her chapped lips to land onto her worn out dress. Edward squeezed her hand a bit tighter, as he could deeply sympathize with her loss. </i></p><p><i>\u201cBefore she left she gave me a kiss on the cheek\u2026Like she always did whenever we said goodbye\u2026I didn\u2019t think\u2014\u201d That sentence was never finished for the old woman couldn\u2019t speak anymore. She began sobbing into the palm of her other hand. And Edward did as well. It was the first time he\u2019d really cried ever since he last saw her, and he thought the agony he was feeling then would be his life sentence.</i></p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>Harry woke up, gasping for air,<i> again</i>.</p><p>He was back in his hospital room, the only sound other than his own ragged breathing and riotous heartbeats was the beeping of one of the machines placed beside his bed. This time, he had a dream about Y/N stuck in a burning house, he risked his own life to run inside to save her but she couldn\u2019t come with him. So he held her close and let the flame swallow them whole. The dreams he\u2019d been having had become more real recently, and he guessed his mild fear of the hospital had something to do with it. Fortunately, Harry wouldn\u2019t have to stay there much longer. The doctors had said, for some reasons they could not explain, his heart\u2019s condition had been slowly going back to normal, as if it\u2019d healed on its own. By this time tomorrow, he could finally be home. </p><p>Harry propped himself up on his elbows then reached out to grab the glass of water his nurse had left on the bedside table. That was when he saw the pile of letters she\u2019d put right under it. He slowly sat up, finishing his water, putting the empty glass back on the table, then with a little bit of hesitation, he took the letters and brought them to his lap. </p><p>When Harry scanned his eyes through the first line, which was the date, he almost thought his eyes were mistaken. The year was <i>1509</i>, which was <i>510 years </i>ago! Was this supposed to be a joke? Or was it just a thing this girl Annalise always did with her lover? Maybe it was a secret message only they knew. Now, Harry couldn\u2019t put the letters down without finishing every single one of them. </p><p>So Harry began to read, <i>every </i>single word. It took him only halfway through the first letter to realize this wasn\u2019t from just <i>\u2018a few years ago\u2019 </i>like Maggie had said. This was a letter from a peasant girl named Ann written to a Prince, Edward Rammour, no other than the man in the portrait, in the museum where the series of strange events and bizarre dreams of Harry\u2019s started. </p><p>The girl, Ann, wrote about their first met, about their little moments together, about the look in his eyes when he looked at her, about the things he said that he didn\u2019t pay attention to but she remembered every single word. And Harry knew every single detail in here, he\u2019d seen them countless of times in his dreams, in which the girl who was supposed to be Ann, looked like Y/N. But the last few letters were all from her point of view so he didn\u2019t know what was gonna happen. She talked about not being able to see him as much, about doubting his love for her, about believing in his love for her again when he snuck out to visit her one night, about the things people in the castle said about her even in her presence, about a princess named Emili\u00e9 who was betrothed to the Prince and hated her deeply, about receiving his letter one night asking her to meet him in the library. And in the last paragraph of the <i>very</i> last letter, she wrote about how happy she was because she believed they were gonna run away together. Harry\u2019s heart wrenched in anguish for he knew that wasn\u2019t what had happened. </p><p>In a millisecond, all the lost memories flooded back to him. Harry now remembered. <i>Everything</i>. </p><p>He remembered her screaming and shouting and begging him to save her and not let them take her away, and he didn\u2019t save her, he watched them take her away. He remembered saying goodbye to her one last time. He remembered the look on her face before the door shut between them, He remembered telling her he loved her, <i>forever</i>, and so he did. He loved her forever.</p><p>He remembered everything.</p><p>And on the hospital bed, he burst into tears, and those tears fell down and blurred out the handwriting of the girl who\u2019d been dead for hundreds of years, yet kept alive inside his heart.</p><p>\u201cLittle Annalise had always preferred to be called Ann.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head quickly and saw Maggie at the door. He didn\u2019t ask her to explain, he <i>already</i> knew what was going on. \u201cIs Y/N\u2026is she\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, <i>she is</i>.\u201d The woman gave him a nod. \u201cDid you feel strange when you looked into her eyes?\u201d He did. \u201cThe eyes are the windows to a person\u2019s soul. That was why when you looked into hers, as well as\u2026your own\u2026in that painting in the museum, you felt a sense of familiarity that you couldn\u2019t explain. Same souls, trapped in two different bodies\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is this even possible?\u201d Harry grimaced, trying to put two and two together on his own, but it wasn\u2019t that simple. \u201cWhy are there only two of us? Do the other\u2026Does this happen to them too? How are you still alive?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the head witch, I\u2019m<i> immortal</i>. Not even fire could kill me,\u201d she said, smiling as she approached his bed and sat down on the chair where she\u2019d sat earlier.</p><p>Taking in a deep breath, she began, \u201cwhen a person dies, their soul breaks into tiny pieces and each creates a new life and they start again, as different people, with no memories of their past lives. However, Ann put a spell on you, or <i>both of you </i>to be exact, to keep your soul from unraveling, and also <i>connected </i>to each other. So you\u2019ll come across each other in every single lifetime, not knowing you\u2019re each other\u2019s <i>soulmates</i>. You\u2019ve had many chances to start over again, but this is the closest you\u2019ve ever got to the ending she wanted you two to have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did it take me until today, <i>this </i>lifetime, to remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it took me<i> that</i> many centuries to have found you.\u201d Maggie sighed. \u201cI usually found Ann first, but as there are more and more people on the Earth nowadays, it\u2019s really difficult to track her down. Every time I arrived in the past, it was already too late. But this time, I guess God does show some mercy after all. He brought me to you instead.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo you working here is all a coincidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA <i>magical</i> coincidence. I almost didn\u2019t believe it when I saw you here.\u201d She showed him a smile. And even though Harry had calmed down by now, he was still in shock. \u201cEdward asked me to give you these letters, he thought only them would help you remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cW-Why should I remember if\u2026if every time we got together one of us died?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause <i>only </i>when you remember, would this story be over.\u201d</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p><i>\u201cAre you sure you want me to have them?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Edward nodded, pushing the letters into Madam Maggie\u2019s hand as he insisted, \u201cyou\u2019re the only hope for me to find her.\u201d</i></p><p><i>She really was. Madam Maggie said once Ann had reincarnated into a new </i><i>body</i><i>, she would be able to feel her, and even if it might take a lot of effort to find her and convince her to believe she was Ann, it was </i><i>possible</i><i>. </i></p><p><i>Honestly, </i><i>Edward</i><i> didn\u2019t really believe in life after death. But he hadn\u2019t believed in witches until he met Ann, and she was real. Sometimes he still wished she hadn\u2019t been real. Maybe if she\u2019d been a dream, a beautiful dream, then he would just sleep forever and never wake up.</i></p><p><i>\u201cBut how did you know it was the only way to break the spell?\u201d He asked Madam Maggie, eyes on the letters. She could sense the sound of fear and doubt in his trembling voice.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI just knew when you first told me, dear.\u201d She put a hand on his shoulder to reassure him. \u201cShe said it herself, only when you\u2019ve found her in another life, could you two finally be together.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Edward exhaled though his mouth as recalled his lover\u2019s last words. She did say so, after she\u2019d kissed him. </i><b><i>The kiss.</i></b><i> He realized it now! That kiss was when she put a spell on them both!</i></p><p><i>\u201cDestiny is a funny thing, it\u2019s like a chess game, if you can\u2019t win, you lose.\u201d Madam Maggie took a deep breath and slowly let it all out. \u201cDestiny wants to keep you two apart, so it will make sure you two are forever kept apart no matter what. Ann tried to break the rules, so by finding her she meant, you, </i><b><i>finding Ann</i></b><i>, not whoever she\u2019d be in the next lifetime, or many after that. If you fail to recognize her but still try to break the rules by being with her, then destiny does what it has to, history repeats itself. One of you will pay the price.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Edward opened his mouth to ask another question, yet Madam Maggie shushed him right before he could release a single sound. \u201cYou should get some rest, your coronation is tomorrow.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Then she walked away, disappeared into the darkness of the long corridor. And that was also the last time he ever saw her.</i></p><p><i>\u201cEdward! Wait, darling!\u201d The voice caught Edward\u2019s attention, and he turned around, wishing he hadn\u2019t. His mother ran up to him, sounding so desperate as she pleaded, \u201cdarling, we need to talk!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo, we don\u2019t,\u201d he said coldly and started walking away. But she chased after him and managed to grab him by the arm.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI understand that you don\u2019t want to speak to your wife but I am\u2014\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cShe\u2019s </i><i>not</i><i> my wife!\u201d He shouted, but the frightened look on her face made him weak</i><i> again</i><i>. \u201cIt\u2019s only a title. Tomorrow she might be the Queen of England, but she will </i><b><i>never </i></b><i>be my wife.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou cannot say that! You have to give her a chance! You need a son to rule after you!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t want a son so he would grow up with a mother like </i><i>that</i><i>. I don\u2019t want him to suffer the same way I am.\u201d Edward hoped those words did hurt the Queen, he hoped the pain shown on her face was genuine. However, he didn\u2019t know anymore, he didn\u2019t believe in it. Was there anything, or anyone in this castle, \u2019</i><i>genuine\u2019</i><i>? \u201c</i><i>Emili\u00e9 </i><i>had told me everything, mother. You sent Ann in there\u2026knowing father could hurt her. You were willing to destroy a young girl\u2019s life just to make sure I\u2019d stay for the throne. Now I am King, are you happy now?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI did it because I love you!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou, same as </i><i>Emili\u00e9</i><i>, same as father, love </i><i>no one</i><i> but yoursel</i><i>f</i><i>!\u201d Each and every one of those word was a knife pierced right through his chest. \u201cThe only one who\u2019s ever loved me for me, and not who I am, or going to be, was Ann, and now she\u2019s </i><b><i>dead</i></b><i>.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI am still your mother\u2026\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou are not.\u201d He shook his head slowly, trying not to cry because she wasn\u2019t worth anymore of his tears. He\u2019d suffered enough. \u201cI </i><i>loved</i><i> you, I really </i><i>loved</i><i> you.\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>Loved. </b>The sound of it crushed the Queen\u2019s dark heart into dust, and she thought she might collapse onto the floor had she been able to feel any of her muscle. She was frozen right where she stood, eyes wide, jaw dropped, heartbroken, staring at the son she\u2019d let down. They could\u2019ve just continued to stand there until sunrise</i><i>, </i><i>had the conversation been interrupted by the arrival of the Chief Minister.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThere you are, Your Highness!\u201d Exclaimed the man, who sounded so </i><i>thrilled </i><i>since he didn\u2019t know what was happening here. \u201cI already had everything you asked prepared for the coronation tomorrow morning. Also Piersilvio, the famous Italian painter, he wanted to paint your portrait as a gif</i><i>t</i><i>. He would arrive at court soon after the ceremony.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cGood.\u201d Edward nodded as he exhaled sharply. \u201cAnything else?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo, Your Highness.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s</i><b><i> 'Your Majesty\u2019 </i></b><i>to you now.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYes\u2026My apologies\u2026Your Majesty\u2026\u201d The Chief Minister hung his head to show respect to the new young King as he was startled by the change in Edward\u2019s attitude. He was afraid he might been in trouble for addressing the monarch in the wrong way, but Edward didn\u2019t pay much attention to it.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHave a good evening, His Excellency. Could you please escort the Queen Mother back to her bed chamber?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201d</i></p><p><i>When Edward absented himself, he heard his mother desperately screaming out his name, begging him to forgive her. However, he turned a deaf ear to all the things she said. He was no different from a dead man walking.</i></p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>There were indeed plenty of museums in London, more than 170 of them. Countless of visitors came and went every single day. What were the chances of two person returning to the same museum, every single day, to sit in front of the same painting? Surely very little. </p><p>For the first few days the pair were there, nobody really noticed. For almost <i>two weeks</i>, they began to. Everyday before the museum was closed, a young man and a young woman would arrive and stare at the portrait of Edward Rammour, and then they left when everyone else did. Some people thought they were lovers who shared the same passion with art, some said they were sad, depressed, and lonely, some said they were crazy. However, nobody actually came and asked them what their story was. Maybe if someone had, they would\u2019ve told them.</p><p>\u201cHow long are you gonna keep tormenting yourself?\u201d Asked Jason as he sat down by his best friend\u2019s side on the bench in front of the painting and handed her a donut, which she refused.</p><p>\u201cUntil I get my memories back\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She snorted. \u201cI think I just need a bit more time with this painting, and it\u2019ll all come back to me. <i>She</i> wanted me to remember. That was why she cursed me as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t really know what she wanted.\u201d Jason heaved a sigh. \u201cMaybe she wanted the King to pay for his mistake by cursing him, but she didn\u2019t think about how it would also affect her in her new lives.\u201d</p><p>That theory seemed justifying, but Y/N knew it wasn\u2019t the truth. People wouldn\u2019t want themselves to be bound together for eternity with someone they loathed. She knew the woman she used to be still loved the King despite it all. If only she could remember what had really happened.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s back in London you know,\u201d Jason broke the silence between the two of them, hand reaching out to hold hers. He thought she might pull away like many times before, but this time she didn\u2019t. She stayed still where she was, emotionless, unbothered. \u201cHave you listened to his new song? It\u2019s about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have. I love it. I wish I could tell him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should reach out to him\u2026if you want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, you know I can\u2019t.\u201d The lump in her throat when she thought about him made it hard for her to breathe. \u201cNot until I know how to break the curse. If we tried to be together, there would be consequences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re gonna spend your entire life, sitting in front of this painting, trying to remember a life you had\u2026five centuries ago?\u201d</p><p>A simple \u201cyes\u201d was her answer. And Jason knew nothing else to say. He wanted what was best for her, and he thought separating her from Harry would fix everything. But everything became worse. She\u2019d been losing sleep, her nightmares got more real and hard to wake up from. Still her memories of her past life were still dust in a desert. </p><p>Jason asked her if she was thirsty, she said no, but he said he would go buy her something to drink anyway. He then laid a kiss on her cheek and stood up to go. She was once again left alone. Actually, she <i>wasn\u2019t </i>alone.</p><p>She could feel him near. She didn\u2019t even need to turn around to know he was there. She just did. And she was afraid to look because her feelings could be wrong, and if he wasn\u2019t standing right behind her she would be so disappointed. That was when his voice rang right through her ear. The first thing he said wasn\u2019t<i> 'hi\u2019 </i>or <i>'hello\u2019</i> or <i>'how have you been?\u2019</i> Or even her name. </p><p>It was, <i>\u201cI\u2019ve found you.\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N rose from the bench to turn around, facing Harry at last. He was wearing an expensive trench coat, hands in its pockets, his grey flat cap made sure half of his face was covered, but there was no way she could mistaken him with anyone else. Time seemed to stop when they locked eyes, and for the first time in what seemed like forever, she felt something she\u2019d never felt before. She parted her lips, wanting to speak, yet no word escaped for she had no idea what to say. He said he\u2019d found her, but she knew he didn\u2019t mean finding her, here, in this museum, it was something else, almost like\u2014</p><p>\u201cOf course you don\u2019t remember\u2026I\u2026uhm\u2014\u201d he mumbled, as if he was talking to himself. Then a dimpled smile crept up on his face only to vanish as soon as Jason returned with a bottle of water for Y/N. </p><p>She didn\u2019t know what was going on in Harry\u2019s mind at that point, and Harry didn\u2019t say a word either. He turned his heels just as Jason recognized him, and quickly made tracks to the nearest exit.</p><p>Her eyes quickly followed his familiar figure to that door over there, then all the sounds around her became muted at once. She didn\u2019t even hear Jason asking her what had just happened, instead she heard Harry\u2019s footsteps echoing inside the walls of her brain as they were fading away. He spun his head and sent her one last look before the door was closed between the two of them. Time stopped. It wasn\u2019t Harry that she saw. </p><p>She saw <i>Edward</i>.</p><p>She saw him being dragged away from her by the men in amours. She heard her own deafening screams as well as his. She saw the flames on the torches on the brick walls mirroring in his green eyes. She saw him mouthing the words <i>'I love you\u2019 </i>to her. The door shut between them two, and she snapped back to reality. Everything vanished. The room, the guards, the flames, the torches, <i>him</i>.</p><p>She remembered it now, <i>everything</i>.</p><p>\u201cY/N! Y/N! Where are you going?!\u201d Jason shouted after her as she started running fast, pushing her way through a crowd of tourists, who screamed at her for being so rude. Then she burst through that door and she screamed out his name, causing many heads to turn around. There was only one face among them that mattered. </p><p>When she saw him she didn\u2019t hesitate. Hell, she\u2019d been waiting for this moment for too long, <i>500 years</i>! Now, she could finally fall into his embrace. Her head against his chest, and she was finally <i>home</i>.</p><p>Shocked as he was, Harry didn\u2019t resist the hug. He chose to ignore all the judging stares they were receiving and clung onto her, eyes squeezed shut, lips pressed to her forehead.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you walk away?\u201d She pulled back to look up at him with a pucker between her brows, all out of breath, yet laughing uncontrollably. </p><p>\u201cYou were\u2026with someone else\u2026\u201d He sounded hurt and confused, it only made her laugh harder.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my best friend Jason, you\u2019ve met him before, remember?\u201d she cried out, voice trembling because she\u2019d never been so happy that she choked on her own words. \u201cI was waiting for <i>you</i>. I\u2019ve been waiting for you for <i>so long</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, so you\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember.\u201d She nodded fast, arms tightened around his waist. \u201cI remember exactly what was going through my head in that tower. I remember feeling so scared when I was on the stake. I remember the last image in my head was you. I remember\u2026telling you to find me in another life so we could finally be together\u2026And you did, Harry you found me.<i>\u201d</i></p><p>When she touched his face, Harry felt as if there was magic on her fingertips. He dug his nose into her palm, sniffing away his own tears as he wiped away the ones that were rolling down her cheeks. He heard the sound of the camera shutter somewhere behind her, behind him, on his left, and his right, knowing their reunion could\u2019ve already made the news already, yet he couldn\u2019t care less.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know I was here?\u201d She asked, still cupping his cheeks with no intention of letting him go.</p><p>\u201cI came to your house and Lisa told me.\u201d He paused. \u201cI\u2019m sorry it took me so long. I needed over a week to think of what to say to you before coming here so I wouldn\u2019t sound insane\u2026I even brought your letters\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you have the letters?\u201d Her eyes grew wide, mouth slightly opened. \u201cWait, have you\u2026have you met <i>her</i>?\u201d Y/N felt like her heart could burst from joy when he nodded his head, telling her yes. \u201cWhere is she?! Is she here?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019ll take you to her, love. She really misses you,\u201d he told her while looking around and spotting a couple sneaky paparazzi. So he locked his fingers around her wrist and urged her to come with him and get out of here so they could finally tell each other everything that had happened.</p><p>\u201cHarry, wait!\u201d Y/N tugged on his arm when he was about to pull her with him. \u201cI\u2026I need you to kiss me now so I can be sure neither of us is gonna die.\u201d</p><p>Her pretentious fear made Harry burst into laughter. With no hesitation, he cupped her cheeks with both hands, bringing his face down to hers so the tips of their noses brushed against each other, then with their lips only one breath apart, he whispered to her, <i>\u201cqueen of my heart.\u201d</i></p><p>He kissed her exactly how she wanted to be kissed, like it was their first, last, everything they had left to lose. This passionate and timeless moment put an official end to the series of misery that had lasted for five centuries long. And people who walked past King Edward\u2019s portrait that day could swear when they told the story, of how they saw the man in the painting, <i>smile</i>.</p></p>",

My mind was empty, and I came up with many bullshit ideas and almost settled down with some of them (glad i DIDN\u2019T!). Then as I was listening to 1000 Times by Sarah Bareilles, from the lyrics, I pictured two strangers meeting each other for the first time, feeling like they\u2019ve known each other forever, but having no clue that they used to be lovers in a different lifetime. It\u2019s just so romantic in my head and I knew I could do this idea justice. So thank you Sarah Bareilles, if you read this fic lemme know lmao. The painting idea was originally from Marc Levy\u2019s novel with the same name (Idk what it\u2019s title in French, but in my translated language it\u2019s) In Another Life, so just to be clear I didn\u2019t really come up with that, credit to the genius who did. Thank you \u201cThe Tudors\u201d for all this knowledge I have about the English dynasties in the 16th century, and I\u2019m genuinely sorry if I offend anyone with all the historical inaccuracies, please forgive me. Thank you everyone who\u2019s read and waited and commented on every chapter to help me make this as good as possible. I know it\u2019s only fiction but to read about how my writing makes some of you happy and feel better really does make me happy and feel better and motivated to write more.</p><p>I\u2019ve had a couple alternative endings to this series, and I think this one is the best (among the others), but if you want to know what the other endings are, feel free to drop me an ask! Or simply tell me what you expected from this chapter before knowing the actual ending here!</p><p>Okay, bye, thank you for putting up with my extra ass! Kissy, Allie.\u2764\ufe0e<br></p><p>___________________________<br><br></p>[[MORE]]<p>Harry ended up spending the rest of his afternoon chatting with his assigned nurse. He\u2019d told the old woman about what had been going on in his life, how he\u2019d met Y/N, the dreams he\u2019d had ever since his trip to the museum, the faces in those dreams that looked just like her. And even though it did feel nice to finally get all this burden off his chest, he still found it strange that she barely opened up about herself. All he knew about her was that her name was Margaret, or <i>Maggie</i> as she preferred to be called, and she lived alone, no husband, no children, and had been working as a nurse for as long as she could remember. </p><p>\u201cI have a feeling that we\u2019ve met before,\u201d he told her at last because it had been bothering him since they first met.\u00a0</p><p>But the woman just looked at him in surprise as she said she didn\u2019t think so.\u00a0\"Although, you do remind me of someone I used to know.\u201c She studied the look on his face, pondering for a little while.</p><p>\"Oh, who is it?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cI had a niece, she fell madly in love with a young man whom you remind me of.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Had</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2026passed away years ago, unfortunately.\u201d</p><p>Harry could see the clear change in her facial expression when she said those words, so he didn\u2019t want to dig too deep into that hurtful memory of hers, even though he was curious to know about the man who resembled him. However, it was Maggie who continued with this topic he thought she wanted to avoid.</p><p>\u201cThat young man was very passionate about my dear Annalise as you are for the girl you love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer name was Annalise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it means <i>Grace of God</i>. I helped her mother pick that name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery beautiful, ma'am.\u201d Harry pressed his lips into a smile when he saw how hers was beaming as she talked about her beloved niece. \u201cI\u2019m sure Annalise and her man were very happy together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. They never got together.\u201d Maggie shook her head slowly. \u201cHis family didn\u2019t want him to be with her and he didn\u2019t have a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo after she\u2026uhm\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cPassed away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, after she passed away, what happened to him?\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause as the old lady\u2019s eyes shifted to her feet, and Harry felt like he never should\u2019ve asked that question. He took a wild guess that the young man must\u2019ve had the same tragic ending as the girl, if that was true, then this was definitely the most heartbreaking story he\u2019d heard in a long time.</p><p>\u201cHe moved on, married the girl his family wanted him to marry, but he never stopped loving her. He died of a heart attack, and his last word was her name.\u201d</p><p>Harry felt a lump in his throat and he had no idea why. He was really hurting over a story of two strangers whom he knew nothing about. His faith in true love had always been faint, after hearing this he had completely lost hope. </p><p>\u201cHad the timing been different, they could\u2019ve ended up together,\u201d he said, breaking the melancholy silence that had taken over the atmosphere surrounding them. </p><p>Maggie released a long heavyhearted sigh as she crossed her legs and leaned back against the chair. She stopped to think for a moment, then she told him, \u201cbut I like to think they\u2019ll meet each other and start again in another life. Because true love never dies. Do you agree?\u201d</p><p>No. Harry didn\u2019t. </p><p>He thought people had had enough chances in one lifetime already and God wouldn\u2019t be so merciful to offer endless trials for them to try and fix their mistakes again and again, lifetime after lifetime. Despite so, he still told Maggie he agreed with her and added, \u201cI\u2019ll have my fingers crossed for the two of them.\u201d</p><p>As he was about to move on to another, more cheerful topic to discuss, the old lady spoke up again, \u201cshe wrote him a letter every single day they\u2019d spent together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, did he get a chance to read them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did. I gave them to him myself. He was very emotional, he burst into tears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore he passed away he gave them back to me.\u201d Maggie rose from the chair by his hospital bed and went to grab her purse, which sat on the table by the window. \u201cI have them with me here, do you want to read them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bring them with you to work?\u201d </p><p>The perplexity on his face made her smile as she pulled out a pile of papers which seemed pretty old, they\u2019d turned to a yellowish brown and were all a bit torn at the edges. \u201cI was moving to a new home today so I brought them with me, I don\u2019t want to put them with the rest of the other stuff in my flat, they\u2019re very fragile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I should read them, they\u2019re very personal, ma'am.\u201d Harry shook his head when she gave the letters to him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an artist, aren\u2019t you? Maybe these love letters will inspire you in your songwriting. And I know my darling Ann would love to share them with people who have the same heart as the man she loved.\u201d</p><p>Did she just say <i>Ann</i>? That was the name Harry had heard many times in his dreams about Y/N. But he could be wrong.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna leave them here for you to read. You have nothing fun to do around here anyway,\u201d Maggie chuckled then walked away from his bed, not expecting a reply from her confused patient.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p><i>Madam Maggie told Edward </i><i>she\u2019d come to him because of</i><i> Ann</i><i>. She\u2019s</i><i> asked her to. Before the fire incident, Ann had a bad feeling, which she just assumed had something to do with Edward marrying someone else. Little did she know, that bad feeling she\u2019d thought was insignificant ended up costing her her own life. </i></p><p><i>In her despair, the poor girl had snuck outside of the castle to see Madam Maggie and asked for two little favors. Thanked to Ann\u2019s favors, Madam Maggie showed up just in time to find an unconscious Edward lying on the floor of his chamber.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHer powers allowed her to detect sickness, she knew you had a weak heart, which was also why you fainted earlier. She didn\u2019t have the heart to tell you, so she came to see me.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnn asked you to cure me?\u201d Edward inquired, placing a hand on the left side of his chest, only to get disappointed by the answer he received from this woman.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI can make you feel </i><i>less pain</i><i>, but I don\u2019t think I can cure you completely. Witches can fix broken bones and mend wounds, but we cannot magic away something so permanent like the heart disease you\u2019ve carried since the day you were born.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Edward nodded understandingly. He seemed so unbothered for someone who had just found out his heart had been unwell since his birth. That was when you know he was, in entirety, </i><b><i>wrecked</i></b><i>. Ann\u2019s death had caused him such pain that nothing else, not even a stab in the gut by the sharpest blade would be able to hurt him that much.</i></p><p><i>\u201cOn the night we met, she fixed the wound on my leg,\u201d he said with a fractured grin and tears in his emerald eyes. \u201cAnd I was supposed to be afraid of her, that was the first time in my life I\u2019d ever seen witchcraft.\u201d He chuckled but there was no humor in the sound of it, just utter desolation. \u201cBut the look in her eyes made me feel safe\u2026and suddenly I wasn\u2019t afraid anymore. I knew she was a good person.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cShe said the same thing about you. She really loved you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnd I let her down\u2026Maybe\u2026Maybe this sickness should just kill me so I can finally be with her.\u201d He took a long pause and shifted his eyes to the window by his bed, sucking in a long breath while contemplating whether or not he should say this out loud. He thought he should. \u201cBefore you got here, I nearly jumped out of that window.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you?\u201d Madam Maggie calmly asked as if she\u2019d already known, both what he\u2019d tried to do, and the reason he\u2019d chosen </i><b><i>not</i></b><i> to do it.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI made a promise to Ann that I would be a good King. I have to live to fulfill that promise.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s good that you\u2019re still thinking straight.\u201d The woman flashed a smile, reaching out to hold his hand which laid lifelessly by his unresponsive body. \u201cI haven\u2019t told you the real reason I\u2019m here. Ann also asked me another favor.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d He asked. </i></p><p><i>Madam Maggie thought that this was the most alive he\u2019d looked since she first saw him. She confided, \u201cdid you know she\u2019d been writing you letters?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cN-No\u2026\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cShe had. Everyday, from the first day she set foot in this castle, to the night before they locked her away. She felt something bad was gonna happen so she brought them to me and asked me to keep them for a while. She told me she\u2019d come back for them, hopefully with you by her side. She was very sure that you two would end up running away together.\u201d When she finished that sentence, Madam Maggie couldn\u2019t control her emotions anymore. Tears started to shed from her eyes, running down the crinkles at the corners of her chapped lips to land onto her worn out dress. Edward squeezed her hand a bit tighter, as he could deeply sympathize with her loss. </i></p><p><i>\u201cBefore she left she gave me a kiss on the cheek\u2026Like she always did whenever we said goodbye\u2026I didn\u2019t think\u2014\u201d That sentence was never finished for the old woman couldn\u2019t speak anymore. She began sobbing into the palm of her other hand. And Edward did as well. It was the first time he\u2019d really cried ever since he last saw her, and he thought the agony he was feeling then would be his life sentence.</i></p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>Harry woke up, gasping for air,<i> again</i>.</p><p>He was back in his hospital room, the only sound other than his own ragged breathing and riotous heartbeats was the beeping of one of the machines placed beside his bed. This time, he had a dream about Y/N stuck in a burning house, he risked his own life to run inside to save her but she couldn\u2019t come with him. So he held her close and let the flame swallow them whole. The dreams he\u2019d been having had become more real recently, and he guessed his mild fear of the hospital had something to do with it. Fortunately, Harry wouldn\u2019t have to stay there much longer. The doctors had said, for some reasons they could not explain, his heart\u2019s condition had been slowly going back to normal, as if it\u2019d healed on its own. By this time tomorrow, he could finally be home. </p><p>Harry propped himself up on his elbows then reached out to grab the glass of water his nurse had left on the bedside table. That was when he saw the pile of letters she\u2019d put right under it. He slowly sat up, finishing his water, putting the empty glass back on the table, then with a little bit of hesitation, he took the letters and brought them to his lap. </p><p>When Harry scanned his eyes through the first line, which was the date, he almost thought his eyes were mistaken. The year was <i>1509</i>, which was <i>510 years </i>ago! Was this supposed to be a joke? Or was it just a thing this girl Annalise always did with her lover? Maybe it was a secret message only they knew. Now, Harry couldn\u2019t put the letters down without finishing every single one of them. </p><p>So Harry began to read, <i>every </i>single word. It took him only halfway through the first letter to realize this wasn\u2019t from just <i>\u2018a few years ago\u2019 </i>like Maggie had said. This was a letter from a peasant girl named Ann written to a Prince, Edward Rammour, no other than the man in the portrait, in the museum where the series of strange events and bizarre dreams of Harry\u2019s started. </p><p>The girl, Ann, wrote about their first met, about their little moments together, about the look in his eyes when he looked at her, about the things he said that he didn\u2019t pay attention to but she remembered every single word. And Harry knew every single detail in here, he\u2019d seen them countless of times in his dreams, in which the girl who was supposed to be Ann, looked like Y/N. But the last few letters were all from her point of view so he didn\u2019t know what was gonna happen. She talked about not being able to see him as much, about doubting his love for her, about believing in his love for her again when he snuck out to visit her one night, about the things people in the castle said about her even in her presence, about a princess named Emili\u00e9 who was betrothed to the Prince and hated her deeply, about receiving his letter one night asking her to meet him in the library. And in the last paragraph of the <i>very</i> last letter, she wrote about how happy she was because she believed they were gonna run away together. Harry\u2019s heart wrenched in anguish for he knew that wasn\u2019t what had happened. </p><p>In a millisecond, all the lost memories flooded back to him. Harry now remembered. <i>Everything</i>. </p><p>He remembered her screaming and shouting and begging him to save her and not let them take her away, and he didn\u2019t save her, he watched them take her away. He remembered saying goodbye to her one last time. He remembered the look on her face before the door shut between them, He remembered telling her he loved her, <i>forever</i>, and so he did. He loved her forever.</p><p>He remembered everything.</p><p>And on the hospital bed, he burst into tears, and those tears fell down and blurred out the handwriting of the girl who\u2019d been dead for hundreds of years, yet kept alive inside his heart.</p><p>\u201cLittle Annalise had always preferred to be called Ann.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head quickly and saw Maggie at the door. He didn\u2019t ask her to explain, he <i>already</i> knew what was going on. \u201cIs Y/N\u2026is she\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, <i>she is</i>.\u201d The woman gave him a nod. \u201cDid you feel strange when you looked into her eyes?\u201d He did. \u201cThe eyes are the windows to a person\u2019s soul. That was why when you looked into hers, as well as\u2026your own\u2026in that painting in the museum, you felt a sense of familiarity that you couldn\u2019t explain. Same souls, trapped in two different bodies\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is this even possible?\u201d Harry grimaced, trying to put two and two together on his own, but it wasn\u2019t that simple. \u201cWhy are there only two of us? Do the other\u2026Does this happen to them too? How are you still alive?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the head witch, I\u2019m<i> immortal</i>. Not even fire could kill me,\u201d she said, smiling as she approached his bed and sat down on the chair where she\u2019d sat earlier.</p><p>Taking in a deep breath, she began, \u201cwhen a person dies, their soul breaks into tiny pieces and each creates a new life and they start again, as different people, with no memories of their past lives. However, Ann put a spell on you, or <i>both of you </i>to be exact, to keep your soul from unraveling, and also <i>connected </i>to each other. So you\u2019ll come across each other in every single lifetime, not knowing you\u2019re each other\u2019s <i>soulmates</i>. You\u2019ve had many chances to start over again, but this is the closest you\u2019ve ever got to the ending she wanted you two to have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did it take me until today, <i>this </i>lifetime, to remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it took me<i> that</i> many centuries to have found you.\u201d Maggie sighed. \u201cI usually found Ann first, but as there are more and more people on the Earth nowadays, it\u2019s really difficult to track her down. Every time I arrived in the past, it was already too late. But this time, I guess God does show some mercy after all. He brought me to you instead.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo you working here is all a coincidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA <i>magical</i> coincidence. I almost didn\u2019t believe it when I saw you here.\u201d She showed him a smile. And even though Harry had calmed down by now, he was still in shock. \u201cEdward asked me to give you these letters, he thought only them would help you remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cW-Why should I remember if\u2026if every time we got together one of us died?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause <i>only </i>when you remember, would this story be over.\u201d</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p><i>\u201cAre you sure you want me to have them?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Edward nodded, pushing the letters into Madam Maggie\u2019s hand as he insisted, \u201cyou\u2019re the only hope for me to find her.\u201d</i></p><p><i>She really was. Madam Maggie said once Ann had reincarnated into a new </i><i>body</i><i>, she would be able to feel her, and even if it might take a lot of effort to find her and convince her to believe she was Ann, it was </i><i>possible</i><i>. </i></p><p><i>Honestly, </i><i>Edward</i><i> didn\u2019t really believe in life after death. But he hadn\u2019t believed in witches until he met Ann, and she was real. Sometimes he still wished she hadn\u2019t been real. Maybe if she\u2019d been a dream, a beautiful dream, then he would just sleep forever and never wake up.</i></p><p><i>\u201cBut how did you know it was the only way to break the spell?\u201d He asked Madam Maggie, eyes on the letters. She could sense the sound of fear and doubt in his trembling voice.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI just knew when you first told me, dear.\u201d She put a hand on his shoulder to reassure him. \u201cShe said it herself, only when you\u2019ve found her in another life, could you two finally be together.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Edward exhaled though his mouth as recalled his lover\u2019s last words. She did say so, after she\u2019d kissed him. </i><b><i>The kiss.</i></b><i> He realized it now! That kiss was when she put a spell on them both!</i></p><p><i>\u201cDestiny is a funny thing, it\u2019s like a chess game, if you can\u2019t win, you lose.\u201d Madam Maggie took a deep breath and slowly let it all out. \u201cDestiny wants to keep you two apart, so it will make sure you two are forever kept apart no matter what. Ann tried to break the rules, so by finding her she meant, you, </i><b><i>finding Ann</i></b><i>, not whoever she\u2019d be in the next lifetime, or many after that. If you fail to recognize her but still try to break the rules by being with her, then destiny does what it has to, history repeats itself. One of you will pay the price.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Edward opened his mouth to ask another question, yet Madam Maggie shushed him right before he could release a single sound. \u201cYou should get some rest, your coronation is tomorrow.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Then she walked away, disappeared into the darkness of the long corridor. And that was also the last time he ever saw her.</i></p><p><i>\u201cEdward! Wait, darling!\u201d The voice caught Edward\u2019s attention, and he turned around, wishing he hadn\u2019t. His mother ran up to him, sounding so desperate as she pleaded, \u201cdarling, we need to talk!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo, we don\u2019t,\u201d he said coldly and started walking away. But she chased after him and managed to grab him by the arm.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI understand that you don\u2019t want to speak to your wife but I am\u2014\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cShe\u2019s </i><i>not</i><i> my wife!\u201d He shouted, but the frightened look on her face made him weak</i><i> again</i><i>. \u201cIt\u2019s only a title. Tomorrow she might be the Queen of England, but she will </i><b><i>never </i></b><i>be my wife.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou cannot say that! You have to give her a chance! You need a son to rule after you!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t want a son so he would grow up with a mother like </i><i>that</i><i>. I don\u2019t want him to suffer the same way I am.\u201d Edward hoped those words did hurt the Queen, he hoped the pain shown on her face was genuine. However, he didn\u2019t know anymore, he didn\u2019t believe in it. Was there anything, or anyone in this castle, \u2019</i><i>genuine\u2019</i><i>? \u201c</i><i>Emili\u00e9 </i><i>had told me everything, mother. You sent Ann in there\u2026knowing father could hurt her. You were willing to destroy a young girl\u2019s life just to make sure I\u2019d stay for the throne. Now I am King, are you happy now?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI did it because I love you!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou, same as </i><i>Emili\u00e9</i><i>, same as father, love </i><i>no one</i><i> but yoursel</i><i>f</i><i>!\u201d Each and every one of those word was a knife pierced right through his chest. \u201cThe only one who\u2019s ever loved me for me, and not who I am, or going to be, was Ann, and now she\u2019s </i><b><i>dead</i></b><i>.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI am still your mother\u2026\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou are not.\u201d He shook his head slowly, trying not to cry because she wasn\u2019t worth anymore of his tears. He\u2019d suffered enough. \u201cI </i><i>loved</i><i> you, I really </i><i>loved</i><i> you.\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>Loved. </b>The sound of it crushed the Queen\u2019s dark heart into dust, and she thought she might collapse onto the floor had she been able to feel any of her muscle. She was frozen right where she stood, eyes wide, jaw dropped, heartbroken, staring at the son she\u2019d let down. They could\u2019ve just continued to stand there until sunrise</i><i>, </i><i>had the conversation been interrupted by the arrival of the Chief Minister.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThere you are, Your Highness!\u201d Exclaimed the man, who sounded so </i><i>thrilled </i><i>since he didn\u2019t know what was happening here. \u201cI already had everything you asked prepared for the coronation tomorrow morning. Also Piersilvio, the famous Italian painter, he wanted to paint your portrait as a gif</i><i>t</i><i>. He would arrive at court soon after the ceremony.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cGood.\u201d Edward nodded as he exhaled sharply. \u201cAnything else?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo, Your Highness.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s</i><b><i> 'Your Majesty\u2019 </i></b><i>to you now.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYes\u2026My apologies\u2026Your Majesty\u2026\u201d The Chief Minister hung his head to show respect to the new young King as he was startled by the change in Edward\u2019s attitude. He was afraid he might been in trouble for addressing the monarch in the wrong way, but Edward didn\u2019t pay much attention to it.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHave a good evening, His Excellency. Could you please escort the Queen Mother back to her bed chamber?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201d</i></p><p><i>When Edward absented himself, he heard his mother desperately screaming out his name, begging him to forgive her. However, he turned a deaf ear to all the things she said. He was no different from a dead man walking.</i></p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>There were indeed plenty of museums in London, more than 170 of them. Countless of visitors came and went every single day. What were the chances of two person returning to the same museum, every single day, to sit in front of the same painting? Surely very little. </p><p>For the first few days the pair were there, nobody really noticed. For almost <i>two weeks</i>, they began to. Everyday before the museum was closed, a young man and a young woman would arrive and stare at the portrait of Edward Rammour, and then they left when everyone else did. Some people thought they were lovers who shared the same passion with art, some said they were sad, depressed, and lonely, some said they were crazy. However, nobody actually came and asked them what their story was. Maybe if someone had, they would\u2019ve told them.</p><p>\u201cHow long are you gonna keep tormenting yourself?\u201d Asked Jason as he sat down by his best friend\u2019s side on the bench in front of the painting and handed her a donut, which she refused.</p><p>\u201cUntil I get my memories back\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She snorted. \u201cI think I just need a bit more time with this painting, and it\u2019ll all come back to me. <i>She</i> wanted me to remember. That was why she cursed me as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t really know what she wanted.\u201d Jason heaved a sigh. \u201cMaybe she wanted the King to pay for his mistake by cursing him, but she didn\u2019t think about how it would also affect her in her new lives.\u201d</p><p>That theory seemed justifying, but Y/N knew it wasn\u2019t the truth. People wouldn\u2019t want themselves to be bound together for eternity with someone they loathed. She knew the woman she used to be still loved the King despite it all. If only she could remember what had really happened.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s back in London you know,\u201d Jason broke the silence between the two of them, hand reaching out to hold hers. He thought she might pull away like many times before, but this time she didn\u2019t. She stayed still where she was, emotionless, unbothered. \u201cHave you listened to his new song? It\u2019s about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have. I love it. I wish I could tell him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should reach out to him\u2026if you want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, you know I can\u2019t.\u201d The lump in her throat when she thought about him made it hard for her to breathe. \u201cNot until I know how to break the curse. If we tried to be together, there would be consequences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re gonna spend your entire life, sitting in front of this painting, trying to remember a life you had\u2026five centuries ago?\u201d</p><p>A simple \u201cyes\u201d was her answer. And Jason knew nothing else to say. He wanted what was best for her, and he thought separating her from Harry would fix everything. But everything became worse. She\u2019d been losing sleep, her nightmares got more real and hard to wake up from. Still her memories of her past life were still dust in a desert. </p><p>Jason asked her if she was thirsty, she said no, but he said he would go buy her something to drink anyway. He then laid a kiss on her cheek and stood up to go. She was once again left alone. Actually, she <i>wasn\u2019t </i>alone.</p><p>She could feel him near. She didn\u2019t even need to turn around to know he was there. She just did. And she was afraid to look because her feelings could be wrong, and if he wasn\u2019t standing right behind her she would be so disappointed. That was when his voice rang right through her ear. The first thing he said wasn\u2019t<i> 'hi\u2019 </i>or <i>'hello\u2019</i> or <i>'how have you been?\u2019</i> Or even her name. </p><p>It was, <i>\u201cI\u2019ve found you.\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N rose from the bench to turn around, facing Harry at last. He was wearing an expensive trench coat, hands in its pockets, his grey flat cap made sure half of his face was covered, but there was no way she could mistaken him with anyone else. Time seemed to stop when they locked eyes, and for the first time in what seemed like forever, she felt something she\u2019d never felt before. She parted her lips, wanting to speak, yet no word escaped for she had no idea what to say. He said he\u2019d found her, but she knew he didn\u2019t mean finding her, here, in this museum, it was something else, almost like\u2014</p><p>\u201cOf course you don\u2019t remember\u2026I\u2026uhm\u2014\u201d he mumbled, as if he was talking to himself. Then a dimpled smile crept up on his face only to vanish as soon as Jason returned with a bottle of water for Y/N. </p><p>She didn\u2019t know what was going on in Harry\u2019s mind at that point, and Harry didn\u2019t say a word either. He turned his heels just as Jason recognized him, and quickly made tracks to the nearest exit.</p><p>Her eyes quickly followed his familiar figure to that door over there, then all the sounds around her became muted at once. She didn\u2019t even hear Jason asking her what had just happened, instead she heard Harry\u2019s footsteps echoing inside the walls of her brain as they were fading away. He spun his head and sent her one last look before the door was closed between the two of them. Time stopped. It wasn\u2019t Harry that she saw. </p><p>She saw <i>Edward</i>.</p><p>She saw him being dragged away from her by the men in amours. She heard her own deafening screams as well as his. She saw the flames on the torches on the brick walls mirroring in his green eyes. She saw him mouthing the words <i>'I love you\u2019 </i>to her. The door shut between them two, and she snapped back to reality. Everything vanished. The room, the guards, the flames, the torches, <i>him</i>.</p><p>She remembered it now, <i>everything</i>.</p><p>\u201cY/N! Y/N! Where are you going?!\u201d Jason shouted after her as she started running fast, pushing her way through a crowd of tourists, who screamed at her for being so rude. Then she burst through that door and she screamed out his name, causing many heads to turn around. There was only one face among them that mattered. </p><p>When she saw him she didn\u2019t hesitate. Hell, she\u2019d been waiting for this moment for too long, <i>500 years</i>! Now, she could finally fall into his embrace. Her head against his chest, and she was finally <i>home</i>.</p><p>Shocked as he was, Harry didn\u2019t resist the hug. He chose to ignore all the judging stares they were receiving and clung onto her, eyes squeezed shut, lips pressed to her forehead.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you walk away?\u201d She pulled back to look up at him with a pucker between her brows, all out of breath, yet laughing uncontrollably. </p><p>\u201cYou were\u2026with someone else\u2026\u201d He sounded hurt and confused, it only made her laugh harder.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my best friend Jason, you\u2019ve met him before, remember?\u201d she cried out, voice trembling because she\u2019d never been so happy that she choked on her own words. \u201cI was waiting for <i>you</i>. I\u2019ve been waiting for you for <i>so long</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, so you\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember.\u201d She nodded fast, arms tightened around his waist. \u201cI remember exactly what was going through my head in that tower. I remember feeling so scared when I was on the stake. I remember the last image in my head was you. I remember\u2026telling you to find me in another life so we could finally be together\u2026And you did, Harry you found me.<i>\u201d</i></p><p>When she touched his face, Harry felt as if there was magic on her fingertips. He dug his nose into her palm, sniffing away his own tears as he wiped away the ones that were rolling down her cheeks. He heard the sound of the camera shutter somewhere behind her, behind him, on his left, and his right, knowing their reunion could\u2019ve already made the news already, yet he couldn\u2019t care less.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know I was here?\u201d She asked, still cupping his cheeks with no intention of letting him go.</p><p>\u201cI came to your house and Lisa told me.\u201d He paused. \u201cI\u2019m sorry it took me so long. I needed over a week to think of what to say to you before coming here so I wouldn\u2019t sound insane\u2026I even brought your letters\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you have the letters?\u201d Her eyes grew wide, mouth slightly opened. \u201cWait, have you\u2026have you met <i>her</i>?\u201d Y/N felt like her heart could burst from joy when he nodded his head, telling her yes. \u201cWhere is she?! Is she here?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019ll take you to her, love. She really misses you,\u201d he told her while looking around and spotting a couple sneaky paparazzi. So he locked his fingers around her wrist and urged her to come with him and get out of here so they could finally tell each other everything that had happened.</p><p>\u201cHarry, wait!\u201d Y/N tugged on his arm when he was about to pull her with him. \u201cI\u2026I need you to kiss me now so I can be sure neither of us is gonna die.\u201d</p><p>Her pretentious fear made Harry burst into laughter. With no hesitation, he cupped her cheeks with both hands, bringing his face down to hers so the tips of their noses brushed against each other, then with their lips only one breath apart, he whispered to her, <i>\u201cqueen of my heart.\u201d</i></p><p>He kissed her exactly how she wanted to be kissed, like it was their first, last, everything they had left to lose. This passionate and timeless moment put an official end to the series of misery that had lasted for five centuries long. And people who walked past King Edward\u2019s portrait that day could swear when they told the story, of how they saw the man in the painting, <i>smile</i>.</p></p>",

My mind was empty, and I came up with many bullshit ideas and almost settled down with some of them (glad i DIDN&rsquo;T!). Then as I was listening to 1000 Times by Sarah Bareilles, from the lyrics, I pictured two strangers meeting each other for the first time, feeling like they&rsquo;ve known each other forever, but having no clue that they used to be lovers in a different lifetime. It&rsquo;s just so romantic in my head and I knew I could do this idea justice. So thank you Sarah Bareilles, if you read this fic lemme know lmao. The painting idea was originally from Marc Levy&rsquo;s novel with the same name (Idk what it&rsquo;s title in French, but in my translated language it&rsquo;s) In Another Life, so just to be clear I didn&rsquo;t really come up with that, credit to the genius who did. Thank you &ldquo;The Tudors&rdquo; for all this knowledge I have about the English dynasties in the 16th century, and I&rsquo;m genuinely sorry if I offend anyone with all the historical inaccuracies, please forgive me. Thank you everyone who&rsquo;s read and waited and commented on every chapter to help me make this as good as possible. I know it&rsquo;s only fiction but to read about how my writing makes some of you happy and feel better really does make me happy and feel better and motivated to write more.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve had a couple alternative endings to this series, and I think this one is the best (among the others), but if you want to know what the other endings are, feel free to drop me an ask!

He&rsquo;d told the old woman about what had been going on in his life, how he&rsquo;d met Y/N, the dreams he&rsquo;d had ever since his trip to the museum, the faces in those dreams that looked just like her. And even though it did feel nice to finally get all this burden off his chest, he still found it strange that she barely opened up about herself. All he knew about her was that her name was Margaret, or <i>Maggie</i> as she preferred to be called, and she lived alone, no husband, no children, and had been working as a nurse for as long as she could remember. </p><p>&ldquo;I have a feeling that we&rsquo;ve met before,&rdquo; he told her at last because it had been bothering him since they first met.&nbsp;</p><p>But the woman just looked at him in surprise as she said she didn&rsquo;t think so.&nbsp;\"Although, you do remind me of someone I used to know.&ldquo; She studied the look on his face, pondering for a little while.</p><p>\"Oh, who is it?&rdquo; He asked.</p><p>&ldquo;I had a niece, she fell madly in love with a young man whom you remind me of.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Had</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&hellip;passed away years ago, unfortunately.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry could see the clear change in her facial expression when she said those words, so he didn&rsquo;t want to dig too deep into that hurtful memory of hers, even though he was curious to know about the man who resembled him. However, it was Maggie who continued with this topic he thought she wanted to avoid.</p><p>&ldquo;That young man was very passionate about my dear Annalise as you are for the girl you love.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Her name was Annalise?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, it means <i>Grace of God</i>. I helped her mother pick that name.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very beautiful, ma'am.&rdquo; Harry pressed his lips into a smile when he saw how hers was beaming as she talked about her beloved niece. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Annalise and her man were very happy together?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. They never got together.&rdquo; Maggie shook her head slowly. &ldquo;His family didn&rsquo;t want him to be with her and he didn&rsquo;t have a choice.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So after she&hellip;uhm&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Passed away?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, after she passed away, what happened to him?&rdquo;</p><p>There was a long pause as the old lady&rsquo;s eyes shifted to her feet, and Harry felt like he never should&rsquo;ve asked that question. He took a wild guess that the young man must&rsquo;ve had the same tragic ending as the girl, if that was true, then this was definitely the most heartbreaking story he&rsquo;d heard in a long time.</p><p>&ldquo;He moved on, married the girl his family wanted him to marry, but he never stopped loving her. He died of a heart attack, and his last word was her name.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry felt a lump in his throat and he had no idea why. He was really hurting over a story of two strangers whom he knew nothing about. His faith in true love had always been faint, after hearing this he had completely lost hope. </p><p>&ldquo;Had the timing been different, they could&rsquo;ve ended up together,&rdquo; he said, breaking the melancholy silence that had taken over the atmosphere surrounding them. </p><p>Maggie released a long heavyhearted sigh as she crossed her legs and leaned back against the chair. She stopped to think for a moment, then she told him, &ldquo;but I like to think they&rsquo;ll meet each other and start again in another life. Because true love never dies. Do you agree?&rdquo;</p><p>No. Harry didn&rsquo;t. </p><p>He thought people had had enough chances in one lifetime already and God wouldn&rsquo;t be so merciful to offer endless trials for them to try and fix their mistakes again and again, lifetime after lifetime. Despite so, he still told Maggie he agreed with her and added, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have my fingers crossed for the two of them.&rdquo;</p><p>As he was about to move on to another, more cheerful topic to discuss, the old lady spoke up again, &ldquo;she wrote him a letter every single day they&rsquo;d spent together.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, did he get a chance to read them?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He did. I gave them to him myself. He was very emotional, he burst into tears.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wow&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Before he passed away he gave them back to me.&rdquo; Maggie rose from the chair by his hospital bed and went to grab her purse, which sat on the table by the window. &ldquo;I have them with me here, do you want to read them?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You bring them with you to work?&rdquo; </p><p>The perplexity on his face made her smile as she pulled out a pile of papers which seemed pretty old, they&rsquo;d turned to a yellowish brown and were all a bit torn at the edges. &ldquo;I was moving to a new home today so I brought them with me, I don&rsquo;t want to put them with the rest of the other stuff in my flat, they&rsquo;re very fragile.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I should read them, they&rsquo;re very personal, ma'am.&rdquo; Harry shook his head when she gave the letters to him.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an artist, aren&rsquo;t you? Maybe these love letters will inspire you in your songwriting. And I know my darling Ann would love to share them with people who have the same heart as the man she loved.&rdquo;</p><p>Did she just say <i>Ann</i>? That was the name Harry had heard many times in his dreams about Y/N. But he could be wrong.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna leave them here for you to read. You have nothing fun to do around here anyway,&rdquo; Maggie chuckled then walked away from his bed, not expecting a reply from her confused patient.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p><i>Madam Maggie told Edward </i><i>she&rsquo;d come to him because of</i><i> Ann</i><i>. She&rsquo;s</i><i> asked her to. Before the fire incident, Ann had a bad feeling, which she just assumed had something to do with Edward marrying someone else. Little did she know, that bad feeling she&rsquo;d thought was insignificant ended up costing her her own life. </i></p><p><i>In her despair, the poor girl had snuck outside of the castle to see Madam Maggie and asked for two little favors. Thanked to Ann&rsquo;s favors, Madam Maggie showed up just in time to find an unconscious Edward lying on the floor of his chamber.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Her powers allowed her to detect sickness, she knew you had a weak heart, which was also why you fainted earlier. She didn&rsquo;t have the heart to tell you, so she came to see me.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Ann asked you to cure me?&rdquo; Edward inquired, placing a hand on the left side of his chest, only to get disappointed by the answer he received from this woman.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I can make you feel </i><i>less pain</i><i>, but I don&rsquo;t think I can cure you completely. Witches can fix broken bones and mend wounds, but we cannot magic away something so permanent like the heart disease you&rsquo;ve carried since the day you were born.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Edward nodded understandingly. He seemed so unbothered for someone who had just found out his heart had been unwell since his birth. That was when you know he was, in entirety, </i><b><i>wrecked</i></b><i>. Ann&rsquo;s death had caused him such pain that nothing else, not even a stab in the gut by the sharpest blade would be able to hurt him that much.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;On the night we met, she fixed the wound on my leg,&rdquo; he said with a fractured grin and tears in his emerald eyes. &ldquo;And I was supposed to be afraid of her, that was the first time in my life I&rsquo;d ever seen witchcraft.&rdquo; He chuckled but there was no humor in the sound of it, just utter desolation. &ldquo;But the look in her eyes made me feel safe&hellip;and suddenly I wasn&rsquo;t afraid anymore. I knew she was a good person.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;She said the same thing about you. She really loved you.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;And I let her down&hellip;Maybe&hellip;Maybe this sickness should just kill me so I can finally be with her.&rdquo; He took a long pause and shifted his eyes to the window by his bed, sucking in a long breath while contemplating whether or not he should say this out loud. He thought he should. &ldquo;Before you got here, I nearly jumped out of that window.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Madam Maggie calmly asked as if she&rsquo;d already known, both what he&rsquo;d tried to do, and the reason he&rsquo;d chosen </i><b><i>not</i></b><i> to do it.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I made a promise to Ann that I would be a good King. I have to live to fulfill that promise.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good that you&rsquo;re still thinking straight.&rdquo; The woman flashed a smile, reaching out to hold his hand which laid lifelessly by his unresponsive body. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t told you the real reason I&rsquo;m here. Ann also asked me another favor.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; He asked. </i></p><p><i>Madam Maggie thought that this was the most alive he&rsquo;d looked since she first saw him. She confided, &ldquo;did you know she&rsquo;d been writing you letters?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;N-No&hellip;&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;She had. Everyday, from the first day she set foot in this castle, to the night before they locked her away. She felt something bad was gonna happen so she brought them to me and asked me to keep them for a while. She told me she&rsquo;d come back for them, hopefully with you by her side. She was very sure that you two would end up running away together.&rdquo; When she finished that sentence, Madam Maggie couldn&rsquo;t control her emotions anymore. Tears started to shed from her eyes, running down the crinkles at the corners of her chapped lips to land onto her worn out dress. Edward squeezed her hand a bit tighter, as he could deeply sympathize with her loss. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Before she left she gave me a kiss on the cheek&hellip;Like she always did whenever we said goodbye&hellip;I didn&rsquo;t think&mdash;&rdquo; That sentence was never finished for the old woman couldn&rsquo;t speak anymore. She began sobbing into the palm of her other hand. And Edward did as well. It was the first time he&rsquo;d really cried ever since he last saw her, and he thought the agony he was feeling then would be his life sentence.</i></p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>Harry woke up, gasping for air,<i> again</i>.</p><p>He was back in his hospital room, the only sound other than his own ragged breathing and riotous heartbeats was the beeping of one of the machines placed beside his bed. This time, he had a dream about Y/N stuck in a burning house, he risked his own life to run inside to save her but she couldn&rsquo;t come with him. So he held her close and let the flame swallow them whole. The dreams he&rsquo;d been having had become more real recently, and he guessed his mild fear of the hospital had something to do with it. Fortunately, Harry wouldn&rsquo;t have to stay there much longer. The doctors had said, for some reasons they could not explain, his heart&rsquo;s condition had been slowly going back to normal, as if it&rsquo;d healed on its own. By this time tomorrow, he could finally be home. </p><p>Harry propped himself up on his elbows then reached out to grab the glass of water his nurse had left on the bedside table. That was when he saw the pile of letters she&rsquo;d put right under it. He slowly sat up, finishing his water, putting the empty glass back on the table, then with a little bit of hesitation, he took the letters and brought them to his lap. </p><p>When Harry scanned his eyes through the first line, which was the date, he almost thought his eyes were mistaken. The year was <i>1509</i>, which was <i>510 years </i>ago! Was this supposed to be a joke? Or was it just a thing this girl Annalise always did with her lover? Maybe it was a secret message only they knew. Now, Harry couldn&rsquo;t put the letters down without finishing every single one of them. </p><p>So Harry began to read, <i>every </i>single word. It took him only halfway through the first letter to realize this wasn&rsquo;t from just <i>&lsquo;a few years ago&rsquo; </i>like Maggie had said. This was a letter from a peasant girl named Ann written to a Prince, Edward Rammour, no other than the man in the portrait, in the museum where the series of strange events and bizarre dreams of Harry&rsquo;s started. </p><p>The girl, Ann, wrote about their first met, about their little moments together, about the look in his eyes when he looked at her, about the things he said that he didn&rsquo;t pay attention to but she remembered every single word. And Harry knew every single detail in here, he&rsquo;d seen them countless of times in his dreams, in which the girl who was supposed to be Ann, looked like Y/N. But the last few letters were all from her point of view so he didn&rsquo;t know what was gonna happen. She talked about not being able to see him as much, about doubting his love for her, about believing in his love for her again when he snuck out to visit her one night, about the things people in the castle said about her even in her presence, about a princess named Emili&eacute; who was betrothed to the Prince and hated her deeply, about receiving his letter one night asking her to meet him in the library. And in the last paragraph of the <i>very</i> last letter, she wrote about how happy she was because she believed they were gonna run away together. Harry&rsquo;s heart wrenched in anguish for he knew that wasn&rsquo;t what had happened. </p><p>In a millisecond, all the lost memories flooded back to him. Harry now remembered. <i>Everything</i>. </p><p>He remembered her screaming and shouting and begging him to save her and not let them take her away, and he didn&rsquo;t save her, he watched them take her away. He remembered saying goodbye to her one last time. He remembered the look on her face before the door shut between them, He remembered telling her he loved her, <i>forever</i>, and so he did. He loved her forever.</p><p>He remembered everything.</p><p>And on the hospital bed, he burst into tears, and those tears fell down and blurred out the handwriting of the girl who&rsquo;d been dead for hundreds of years, yet kept alive inside his heart.</p><p>&ldquo;Little Annalise had always preferred to be called Ann.&rdquo;</p><p>He lifted his head quickly and saw Maggie at the door. He didn&rsquo;t ask her to explain, he <i>already</i> knew what was going on. &ldquo;Is Y/N&hellip;is she&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>she is</i>.&rdquo; The woman gave him a nod. &ldquo;Did you feel strange when you looked into her eyes?&rdquo; He did. &ldquo;The eyes are the windows to a person&rsquo;s soul. That was why when you looked into hers, as well as&hellip;your own&hellip;in that painting in the museum, you felt a sense of familiarity that you couldn&rsquo;t explain. Same souls, trapped in two different bodies&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How is this even possible?&rdquo; Harry grimaced, trying to put two and two together on his own, but it wasn&rsquo;t that simple. &ldquo;Why are there only two of us? Do the other&hellip;Does this happen to them too? How are you still alive?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the head witch, I&rsquo;m<i> immortal</i>. Not even fire could kill me,&rdquo; she said, smiling as she approached his bed and sat down on the chair where she&rsquo;d sat earlier.</p><p>Taking in a deep breath, she began, &ldquo;when a person dies, their soul breaks into tiny pieces and each creates a new life and they start again, as different people, with no memories of their past lives. However, Ann put a spell on you, or <i>both of you </i>to be exact, to keep your soul from unraveling, and also <i>connected </i>to each other. So you&rsquo;ll come across each other in every single lifetime, not knowing you&rsquo;re each other&rsquo;s <i>soulmates</i>. You&rsquo;ve had many chances to start over again, but this is the closest you&rsquo;ve ever got to the ending she wanted you two to have.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why did it take me until today, <i>this </i>lifetime, to remember?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because it took me<i> that</i> many centuries to have found you.&rdquo; Maggie sighed. &ldquo;I usually found Ann first, but as there are more and more people on the Earth nowadays, it&rsquo;s really difficult to track her down. Every time I arrived in the past, it was already too late. But this time, I guess God does show some mercy after all. He brought me to you instead.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;So you working here is all a coincidence.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A <i>magical</i> coincidence. I almost didn&rsquo;t believe it when I saw you here.&rdquo; She showed him a smile. And even though Harry had calmed down by now, he was still in shock. &ldquo;Edward asked me to give you these letters, he thought only them would help you remember.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;W-Why should I remember if&hellip;if every time we got together one of us died?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because <i>only </i>when you remember, would this story be over.&rdquo;</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Are you sure you want me to have them?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Edward nodded, pushing the letters into Madam Maggie&rsquo;s hand as he insisted, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re the only hope for me to find her.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>She really was. Madam Maggie said once Ann had reincarnated into a new </i><i>body</i><i>, she would be able to feel her, and even if it might take a lot of effort to find her and convince her to believe she was Ann, it was </i><i>possible</i><i>. </i></p><p><i>Honestly, </i><i>Edward</i><i> didn&rsquo;t really believe in life after death. But he hadn&rsquo;t believed in witches until he met Ann, and she was real. Sometimes he still wished she hadn&rsquo;t been real. Maybe if she&rsquo;d been a dream, a beautiful dream, then he would just sleep forever and never wake up.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;But how did you know it was the only way to break the spell?&rdquo; He asked Madam Maggie, eyes on the letters. She could sense the sound of fear and doubt in his trembling voice.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I just knew when you first told me, dear.&rdquo; She put a hand on his shoulder to reassure him. &ldquo;She said it herself, only when you&rsquo;ve found her in another life, could you two finally be together.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Edward exhaled though his mouth as recalled his lover&rsquo;s last words. She did say so, after she&rsquo;d kissed him. </i><b><i>The kiss.</i></b><i> He realized it now! That kiss was when she put a spell on them both!</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Destiny is a funny thing, it&rsquo;s like a chess game, if you can&rsquo;t win, you lose.&rdquo; Madam Maggie took a deep breath and slowly let it all out. &ldquo;Destiny wants to keep you two apart, so it will make sure you two are forever kept apart no matter what. Ann tried to break the rules, so by finding her she meant, you, </i><b><i>finding Ann</i></b><i>, not whoever she&rsquo;d be in the next lifetime, or many after that. If you fail to recognize her but still try to break the rules by being with her, then destiny does what it has to, history repeats itself. One of you will pay the price.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Edward opened his mouth to ask another question, yet Madam Maggie shushed him right before he could release a single sound. &ldquo;You should get some rest, your coronation is tomorrow.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Then she walked away, disappeared into the darkness of the long corridor. And that was also the last time he ever saw her.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Edward! Wait, darling!&rdquo; The voice caught Edward&rsquo;s attention, and he turned around, wishing he hadn&rsquo;t. His mother ran up to him, sounding so desperate as she pleaded, &ldquo;darling, we need to talk!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;No, we don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said coldly and started walking away. But she chased after him and managed to grab him by the arm.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I understand that you don&rsquo;t want to speak to your wife but I am&mdash;&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s </i><i>not</i><i> my wife!&rdquo; He shouted, but the frightened look on her face made him weak</i><i> again</i><i>. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a title. Tomorrow she might be the Queen of England, but she will </i><b><i>never </i></b><i>be my wife.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You cannot say that! You have to give her a chance! You need a son to rule after you!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want a son so he would grow up with a mother like </i><i>that</i><i>. I don&rsquo;t want him to suffer the same way I am.&rdquo; Edward hoped those words did hurt the Queen, he hoped the pain shown on her face was genuine. However, he didn&rsquo;t know anymore, he didn&rsquo;t believe in it. Was there anything, or anyone in this castle, &rsquo;</i><i>genuine&rsquo;</i><i>? &ldquo;</i><i>Emili&eacute; </i><i>had told me everything, mother. You sent Ann in there&hellip;knowing father could hurt her. You were willing to destroy a young girl&rsquo;s life just to make sure I&rsquo;d stay for the throne. Now I am King, are you happy now?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I did it because I love you!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You, same as </i><i>Emili&eacute;</i><i>, same as father, love </i><i>no one</i><i> but yoursel</i><i>f</i><i>!&rdquo; Each and every one of those word was a knife pierced right through his chest. &ldquo;The only one who&rsquo;s ever loved me for me, and not who I am, or going to be, was Ann, and now she&rsquo;s </i><b><i>dead</i></b><i>.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I am still your mother&hellip;&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You are not.&rdquo; He shook his head slowly, trying not to cry because she wasn&rsquo;t worth anymore of his tears. He&rsquo;d suffered enough. &ldquo;I </i><i>loved</i><i> you, I really </i><i>loved</i><i> you.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i><b>Loved. </b>The sound of it crushed the Queen&rsquo;s dark heart into dust, and she thought she might collapse onto the floor had she been able to feel any of her muscle. She was frozen right where she stood, eyes wide, jaw dropped, heartbroken, staring at the son she&rsquo;d let down. They could&rsquo;ve just continued to stand there until sunrise</i><i>, </i><i>had the conversation been interrupted by the arrival of the Chief Minister.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;There you are, Your Highness!&rdquo; Exclaimed the man, who sounded so </i><i>thrilled </i><i>since he didn&rsquo;t know what was happening here. &ldquo;I already had everything you asked prepared for the coronation tomorrow morning. Also Piersilvio, the famous Italian painter, he wanted to paint your portrait as a gif</i><i>t</i><i>. He would arrive at court soon after the ceremony.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo; Edward nodded as he exhaled sharply. &ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;No, Your Highness.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s</i><b><i> 'Your Majesty&rsquo; </i></b><i>to you now.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Yes&hellip;My apologies&hellip;Your Majesty&hellip;&rdquo; The Chief Minister hung his head to show respect to the new young King as he was startled by the change in Edward&rsquo;s attitude. He was afraid he might been in trouble for addressing the monarch in the wrong way, but Edward didn&rsquo;t pay much attention to it.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Have a good evening, His Excellency. Could you please escort the Queen Mother back to her bed chamber?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Yes, Your Majesty.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>When Edward absented himself, he heard his mother desperately screaming out his name, begging him to forgive her. However, he turned a deaf ear to all the things she said. He was no different from a dead man walking.</i></p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>There were indeed plenty of museums in London, more than 170 of them. Countless of visitors came and went every single day. What were the chances of two person returning to the same museum, every single day, to sit in front of the same painting? Surely very little. </p><p>For the first few days the pair were there, nobody really noticed. For almost <i>two weeks</i>, they began to. Everyday before the museum was closed, a young man and a young woman would arrive and stare at the portrait of Edward Rammour, and then they left when everyone else did. Some people thought they were lovers who shared the same passion with art, some said they were sad, depressed, and lonely, some said they were crazy. However, nobody actually came and asked them what their story was. Maybe if someone had, they would&rsquo;ve told them.</p><p>&ldquo;How long are you gonna keep tormenting yourself?&rdquo; Asked Jason as he sat down by his best friend&rsquo;s side on the bench in front of the painting and handed her a donut, which she refused.</p><p>&ldquo;Until I get my memories back&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s impossible.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; She snorted. &ldquo;I think I just need a bit more time with this painting, and it&rsquo;ll all come back to me. <i>She</i> wanted me to remember. That was why she cursed me as well.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t really know what she wanted.&rdquo; Jason heaved a sigh. &ldquo;Maybe she wanted the King to pay for his mistake by cursing him, but she didn&rsquo;t think about how it would also affect her in her new lives.&rdquo;</p><p>That theory seemed justifying, but Y/N knew it wasn&rsquo;t the truth. People wouldn&rsquo;t want themselves to be bound together for eternity with someone they loathed. She knew the woman she used to be still loved the King despite it all. If only she could remember what had really happened.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s back in London you know,&rdquo; Jason broke the silence between the two of them, hand reaching out to hold hers. He thought she might pull away like many times before, but this time she didn&rsquo;t. She stayed still where she was, emotionless, unbothered. &ldquo;Have you listened to his new song? It&rsquo;s about you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have. I love it. I wish I could tell him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You should reach out to him&hellip;if you want to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, you know I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; The lump in her throat when she thought about him made it hard for her to breathe. &ldquo;Not until I know how to break the curse. If we tried to be together, there would be consequences.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re gonna spend your entire life, sitting in front of this painting, trying to remember a life you had&hellip;five centuries ago?&rdquo;</p><p>A simple &ldquo;yes&rdquo; was her answer. And Jason knew nothing else to say. He wanted what was best for her, and he thought separating her from Harry would fix everything. But everything became worse. She&rsquo;d been losing sleep, her nightmares got more real and hard to wake up from. Still her memories of her past life were still dust in a desert. </p><p>Jason asked her if she was thirsty, she said no, but he said he would go buy her something to drink anyway. He then laid a kiss on her cheek and stood up to go. She was once again left alone. Actually, she <i>wasn&rsquo;t </i>alone.</p><p>She could feel him near. She didn&rsquo;t even need to turn around to know he was there. She just did. And she was afraid to look because her feelings could be wrong, and if he wasn&rsquo;t standing right behind her she would be so disappointed. That was when his voice rang right through her ear. The first thing he said wasn&rsquo;t<i> 'hi&rsquo; </i>or <i>'hello&rsquo;</i> or <i>'how have you been?&rsquo;</i> Or even her name. </p><p>It was, <i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found you.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Y/N rose from the bench to turn around, facing Harry at last. He was wearing an expensive trench coat, hands in its pockets, his grey flat cap made sure half of his face was covered, but there was no way she could mistaken him with anyone else. Time seemed to stop when they locked eyes, and for the first time in what seemed like forever, she felt something she&rsquo;d never felt before. She parted her lips, wanting to speak, yet no word escaped for she had no idea what to say. He said he&rsquo;d found her, but she knew he didn&rsquo;t mean finding her, here, in this museum, it was something else, almost like&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course you don&rsquo;t remember&hellip;I&hellip;uhm&mdash;&rdquo; he mumbled, as if he was talking to himself. Then a dimpled smile crept up on his face only to vanish as soon as Jason returned with a bottle of water for Y/N. </p><p>She didn&rsquo;t know what was going on in Harry&rsquo;s mind at that point, and Harry didn&rsquo;t say a word either. He turned his heels just as Jason recognized him, and quickly made tracks to the nearest exit.</p><p>Her eyes quickly followed his familiar figure to that door over there, then all the sounds around her became muted at once. She didn&rsquo;t even hear Jason asking her what had just happened, instead she heard Harry&rsquo;s footsteps echoing inside the walls of her brain as they were fading away. He spun his head and sent her one last look before the door was closed between the two of them. Time stopped. It wasn&rsquo;t Harry that she saw. </p><p>She saw <i>Edward</i>.</p><p>She saw him being dragged away from her by the men in amours. She heard her own deafening screams as well as his. She saw the flames on the torches on the brick walls mirroring in his green eyes. She saw him mouthing the words <i>'I love you&rsquo; </i>to her. The door shut between them two, and she snapped back to reality. Everything vanished. The room, the guards, the flames, the torches, <i>him</i>.</p><p>She remembered it now, <i>everything</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N! Y/N! Where are you going?!&rdquo; Jason shouted after her as she started running fast, pushing her way through a crowd of tourists, who screamed at her for being so rude. Then she burst through that door and she screamed out his name, causing many heads to turn around. There was only one face among them that mattered. </p><p>When she saw him she didn&rsquo;t hesitate. Hell, she&rsquo;d been waiting for this moment for too long, <i>500 years</i>! Now, she could finally fall into his embrace. Her head against his chest, and she was finally <i>home</i>.</p><p>Shocked as he was, Harry didn&rsquo;t resist the hug. He chose to ignore all the judging stares they were receiving and clung onto her, eyes squeezed shut, lips pressed to her forehead.</p><p>&ldquo;Why did you walk away?&rdquo; She pulled back to look up at him with a pucker between her brows, all out of breath, yet laughing uncontrollably. </p><p>&ldquo;You were&hellip;with someone else&hellip;&rdquo; He sounded hurt and confused, it only made her laugh harder.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my best friend Jason, you&rsquo;ve met him before, remember?&rdquo; she cried out, voice trembling because she&rsquo;d never been so happy that she choked on her own words. &ldquo;I was waiting for <i>you</i>. I&rsquo;ve been waiting for you for <i>so long</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, so you&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I remember.&rdquo; She nodded fast, arms tightened around his waist. &ldquo;I remember exactly what was going through my head in that tower. I remember feeling so scared when I was on the stake. I remember the last image in my head was you. I remember&hellip;telling you to find me in another life so we could finally be together&hellip;And you did, Harry you found me.<i>&rdquo;</i></p><p>When she touched his face, Harry felt as if there was magic on her fingertips. He dug his nose into her palm, sniffing away his own tears as he wiped away the ones that were rolling down her cheeks. He heard the sound of the camera shutter somewhere behind her, behind him, on his left, and his right, knowing their reunion could&rsquo;ve already made the news already, yet he couldn&rsquo;t care less.</p><p>&ldquo;How did you know I was here?&rdquo; She asked, still cupping his cheeks with no intention of letting him go.</p><p>&ldquo;I came to your house and Lisa told me.&rdquo; He paused. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry it took me so long. I needed over a week to think of what to say to you before coming here so I wouldn&rsquo;t sound insane&hellip;I even brought your letters&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How do you have the letters?&rdquo; Her eyes grew wide, mouth slightly opened. &ldquo;Wait, have you&hellip;have you met <i>her</i>?&rdquo; Y/N felt like her heart could burst from joy when he nodded his head, telling her yes. &ldquo;Where is she?! Is she here?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, but I&rsquo;ll take you to her, love. She really misses you,&rdquo; he told her while looking around and spotting a couple sneaky paparazzi. So he locked his fingers around her wrist and urged her to come with him and get out of here so they could finally tell each other everything that had happened.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, wait!&rdquo; Y/N tugged on his arm when he was about to pull her with him. &ldquo;I&hellip;I need you to kiss me now so I can be sure neither of us is gonna die.&rdquo;</p><p>Her pretentious fear made Harry burst into laughter. With no hesitation, he cupped her cheeks with both hands, bringing his face down to hers so the tips of their noses brushed against each other, then with their lips only one breath apart, he whispered to her, <i>&ldquo;queen of my heart.&rdquo;</i></p><p>He kissed her exactly how she wanted to be kissed, like it was their first, last, everything they had left to lose. This passionate and timeless moment put an official end to the series of misery that had lasted for five centuries long. And people who walked past King Edward&rsquo;s portrait that day could swear when they told the story, of how they saw the man in the painting, <i>smile</i>.</p></p>",

Then as I was listening to 1000 Times by Sarah Bareilles, from the lyrics, I pictured two strangers meeting each other for the first time, feeling like they&rsquo;ve known each other forever, but having no clue that they used to be lovers in a different lifetime. It&rsquo;s just so romantic in my head and I knew I could do this idea justice. So thank you Sarah Bareilles, if you read this fic lemme know lmao. The painting idea was originally from Marc Levy&rsquo;s novel with the same name (Idk what it&rsquo;s title in French, but in my translated language it&rsquo;s) In Another Life, so just to be clear I didn&rsquo;t really come up with that, credit to the genius who did. Thank you &ldquo;The Tudors&rdquo; for all this knowledge I have about the English dynasties in the 16th century, and I&rsquo;m genuinely sorry if I offend anyone with all the historical inaccuracies, please forgive me. Thank you everyone who&rsquo;s read and waited and commented on every chapter to help me make this as good as possible. I know it&rsquo;s only fiction but to read about how my writing makes some of you happy and feel better really does make me happy and feel better and motivated to write more.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve had a couple alternative endings to this series, and I think this one is the best (among the others), but if you want to know what the other endings are, feel free to drop me an ask! Or simply tell me what you expected from this chapter before knowing the actual ending here!</p>\n<p>Okay, bye, thank you for putting up with my extra ass! Kissy, Allie.&#10084;&#65038;<br /></p>\n<p>___________________________<br /><br /></p>\n</p>",

People admitted to being too scared to approach you, scared they&rsquo;d be met with a bitchy attitude. They later would encourage other people to walk up and talk to you because you truly are the sweetest person they had ever met. You heard the many stories (of people thinking you were a bitch and you ended up being a sweetheart) all your life. But you couldn&rsquo;t help it, it was just your face.</p><p>Tonight was your best friend, Aurora&rsquo;s, birthday party that you had planned. You were super excited and wanted it to be the best night of her life. You wore a white sweater dress with a turtle neck, seeing how it was 24\u00b0F in New York. You wore a gold Chanel chain belt around your waist and snake print boots. You didn&rsquo;t want to outshine the birthday girl so you stuck to a simple outfit thats was cute and still comfortable.</p><p>You were the first to show up to the party; you were adamant about this being a great night and was putting on the finishing touches when the guests started to arrive.

This is truly the most amazing place I&rsquo;ve been in, you really went all out for me,&rdquo; She smiled gratefully.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course, you&rsquo;re my best friend,&rdquo; You nodded.</p><p>While you were talking one of Liam&rsquo;s friends, Harry Styles, came up to him and you didn&rsquo;t mean to ignore him&hellip; but you did.

She&rsquo;s the one that set up the party,&rdquo; Liam explained.</p><p>&ldquo;And she didn&rsquo;t speak to me?&rdquo; Harry narrowed his eyes.

Think you&rsquo;d really like her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna have to pass on that one,&rdquo; Harry shook his head and when to go get a drink.</p><p>As the night went on, you met more and more people. Although you planned the party, Aurora gave you a list of people to invite, and trust and believe that she knew way more people than you.</p><p>Word spread that despite your face, you were super nice and of course, that news came traveling back Harry, but he wasn&rsquo;t having it.</p><p>&ldquo;Go talk to her, mate,&rdquo; Niall had encouraged. You also knew who he was before he introduced himself but, never met him before. You told him you were a big fan and even went to a couple of his concerts.</p><p>&ldquo;Like I said earlier, I&rsquo;ll pass. If you&rsquo;re supposed to be hosting a party, you introduce yourself to the guests, not the other way around,&rdquo; He huffed.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, it&rsquo;s really not that deep,&rdquo; Liam rolled his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;But it is. She seems bratty and not someone I&rsquo;d even think about hanging out with. She seems like a bitch,&rdquo; Harry said bluntly not knowing nor caring who was around him.</p><p>When you heard this you sighed and decided that you <i>had</i> to say something. You truly were a big fan of his and it sucks that your facial expression and introverted-ness is messing things up for you.</p><p>You tapped him on the shoulder and he turned around and was shocked when he saw you, but it it quickly turned smug.</p><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;m really sorry you feel that way about me. My name&rsquo;s Y/N,&rdquo; You introduced yourself, your heart racing. &ldquo;&rsquo;m a big fan of yours, been wanting to say something all night but I&rsquo;m a tad shy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no excuse to not greet guests,&rdquo; Harry fought back, wanting to prove a point and you started to feel defeated.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re absolutely right and I apologize; didn&rsquo;t mean to give off a bad impression. I hope you enjoy the rest of your evening,&rdquo; You said softly before walking away, getting lost in the crowd of people.</p><p>&ldquo;Well done, Harry,&rdquo; Niall slowly clapped before rolling his eyes and walking off.</p><p>Harry did feel a little bad for what he had said but he still stood by his point. Kind of. Maybe not so much anymore.</p><p>Harry didn&rsquo;t see you for the rest of the evening, even when everyone was giving speeches. You really wanted to give a speech about your amazing best friend but you weren&rsquo;t comfortable talking to crowds.</p><p>The party was over and you were left to clean up. Aurora and Liam helped for a bit but you showed them out, telling them to get some rest. You thought were finally left alone with just your thoughts when you heard Harry&rsquo;s voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, where did Liam go off to?&rdquo; He asked. &ldquo;I was just in the bathroom and now he&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;</p><p>You jumped at the sound of his voice and turned to face him.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, thought I was alone,&rdquo; You chuckled with your hand on your fast beating heart. &ldquo;He just left with Aurora.&rdquo;</p><p>He muttered curses and how he was stuck without a ride.</p><p>&ldquo;If you just give me a few minutes, I can give you a ride,&rdquo; You offered him.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; He questioned and narrowed his eyes, as if that was going to help him hear you better.</p><p>&ldquo;I said I can give you a ride,&rdquo; You repeated yourself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost done cleaning, just give me 10 minutes.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry hesitated before nodding and deciding to help you clean up.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the help, really appreciate it. Let me go grab my things and we\u2019ll be on our way, yeah?\u201d You tiredly smiled and went to grab your purse.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a coat?\u201d He asked when you returned. You shook your head and started to walk out the front door. \u201cHere, wear mine; it\u2019s freezing outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no thank you. If I take your coat, you\u2019ll be much colder than me and your shirt is much thinner than my dress. Is it Gucci?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, how\u2019d you know?\u201d He raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cI can tell. I love Gucci. And Prada, and Chanel, and Louis Vuitton, and anything else high fashion,\u201d You giggled.</p><p>He nodded, interested. \u201cWell, I insist you take the jacket. We\u2019re not leaving until you do,\u201d He insisted.</p><p>You sighed and took the jacket from him. \u201cI\u2019m only taking it because we need to get you home so you can sleep. \u2018s nearly three in the morning,\u201d You looked over that the clock.</p><p>Once the two of you got into your car, it was pretty much silent the entire ride. You were too nervous, not wanting to further damage the already bad first impression. You arrived at Harry\u2019s house and started to take the jacket off your body.</p><p>\u201cKeep it, Y/N,\u201d He stopped you.</p><p>\u201cBut why? I-I thought you didn\u2019t like me,\u201d You questioned.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that, I guess I just didn\u2019t get to know you. And I still don\u2019t know you but you\u2019re not as bad as your face makes you seem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that a lot,\u201d You chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m trying to work on it. Trying to open myself up more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, keep the jacket and it\u2019ll give me a reason to hunt you down for it tomorrow morning,\u201d Harry smiled with mischief in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou think this is some knockoff Cinderella?\u201d You laughed.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d He shrugged and quickly got out the car before you could protest.</p><p>You shook your head happily and vowed to never let your shyness get in the way of things again.</p><p><i>[AN: this is the longest one I\u2019ve written in a while and I\u2019m glad I\u2019m getting over my writer\u2019s block. leave suggestions or anything really; my inbox is open]</i></p>",

People admitted to being too scared to approach you, scared they\u2019d be met with a bitchy attitude. They later would encourage other people to walk up and talk to you because you truly are the sweetest person they had ever met. You heard the many stories (of people thinking you were a bitch and you ended up being a sweetheart) all your life. But you couldn\u2019t help it, it was just your face.</p><p>Tonight was your best friend, Aurora\u2019s, birthday party that you had planned. You were super excited and wanted it to be the best night of her life. You wore a white sweater dress with a turtle neck, seeing how it was 24\u00b0F in New York. You wore a gold Chanel chain belt around your waist and snake print boots. You didn\u2019t want to outshine the birthday girl so you stuck to a simple outfit thats was cute and still comfortable.</p><p>You were the first to show up to the party; you were adamant about this being a great night and was putting on the finishing touches when the guests started to arrive.

Y/N\u2019s just so antisocial that when she \u2018sees\u2019 someone she doesn\u2019t know, she doesn\u2019t really 'see\u2019 them until they introduce themselves, if that makes sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust go introduce yourself, she\u2019s truly the sweetest. Think you\u2019d really like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna have to pass on that one,\u201d Harry shook his head and when to go get a drink.</p><p>As the night went on, you met more and more people. Although you planned the party, Aurora gave you a list of people to invite, and trust and believe that she knew way more people than you.</p><p>Word spread that despite your face, you were super nice and of course, that news came traveling back Harry, but he wasn\u2019t having it.</p><p>\u201cGo talk to her, mate,\u201d Niall had encouraged. You also knew who he was before he introduced himself but, never met him before. You told him you were a big fan and even went to a couple of his concerts.</p><p>\u201cLike I said earlier, I\u2019ll pass. If you\u2019re supposed to be hosting a party, you introduce yourself to the guests, not the other way around,\u201d He huffed.</p><p>\u201cHarry, it\u2019s really not that deep,\u201d Liam rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cBut it is. She seems bratty and not someone I\u2019d even think about hanging out with. She seems like a bitch,\u201d Harry said bluntly not knowing nor caring who was around him.</p><p>When you heard this you sighed and decided that you <i>had</i> to say something. You truly were a big fan of his and it sucks that your facial expression and introverted-ness is messing things up for you.</p><p>You tapped him on the shoulder and he turned around and was shocked when he saw you, but it it quickly turned smug.</p><p>\u201c\u2019m really sorry you feel that way about me. My name\u2019s Y/N,\u201d You introduced yourself, your heart racing. \u201c\u2019m a big fan of yours, been wanting to say something all night but I\u2019m a tad shy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no excuse to not greet guests,\u201d Harry fought back, wanting to prove a point and you started to feel defeated.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re absolutely right and I apologize; didn\u2019t mean to give off a bad impression. I hope you enjoy the rest of your evening,\u201d You said softly before walking away, getting lost in the crowd of people.</p><p>\u201cWell done, Harry,\u201d Niall slowly clapped before rolling his eyes and walking off.</p><p>Harry did feel a little bad for what he had said but he still stood by his point. Kind of. Maybe not so much anymore.</p><p>Harry didn\u2019t see you for the rest of the evening, even when everyone was giving speeches. You really wanted to give a speech about your amazing best friend but you weren\u2019t comfortable talking to crowds.</p><p>The party was over and you were left to clean up. Aurora and Liam helped for a bit but you showed them out, telling them to get some rest. You thought were finally left alone with just your thoughts when you heard Harry\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cHey, where did Liam go off to?\u201d He asked. \u201cI was just in the bathroom and now he\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>You jumped at the sound of his voice and turned to face him.</p><p>\u201cSorry, thought I was alone,\u201d You chuckled with your hand on your fast beating heart. \u201cHe just left with Aurora.\u201d</p><p>He muttered curses and how he was stuck without a ride.</p><p>\u201cIf you just give me a few minutes, I can give you a ride,\u201d You offered him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He questioned and narrowed his eyes, as if that was going to help him hear you better.</p><p>\u201cI said I can give you a ride,\u201d You repeated yourself. \u201cI\u2019m almost done cleaning, just give me 10 minutes.\u201d</p><p>Harry hesitated before nodding and deciding to help you clean up.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the help, really appreciate it. Let me go grab my things and we\u2019ll be on our way, yeah?\u201d You tiredly smiled and went to grab your purse.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a coat?\u201d He asked when you returned. You shook your head and started to walk out the front door. \u201cHere, wear mine; it\u2019s freezing outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no thank you. If I take your coat, you\u2019ll be much colder than me and your shirt is much thinner than my dress. Is it Gucci?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, how\u2019d you know?\u201d He raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cI can tell. I love Gucci. And Prada, and Chanel, and Louis Vuitton, and anything else high fashion,\u201d You giggled.</p><p>He nodded, interested. \u201cWell, I insist you take the jacket. We\u2019re not leaving until you do,\u201d He insisted.</p><p>You sighed and took the jacket from him. \u201cI\u2019m only taking it because we need to get you home so you can sleep. \u2018s nearly three in the morning,\u201d You looked over that the clock.</p><p>Once the two of you got into your car, it was pretty much silent the entire ride. You were too nervous, not wanting to further damage the already bad first impression. You arrived at Harry\u2019s house and started to take the jacket off your body.</p><p>\u201cKeep it, Y/N,\u201d He stopped you.</p><p>\u201cBut why? I-I thought you didn\u2019t like me,\u201d You questioned.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that, I guess I just didn\u2019t get to know you. And I still don\u2019t know you but you\u2019re not as bad as your face makes you seem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that a lot,\u201d You chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m trying to work on it. Trying to open myself up more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, keep the jacket and it\u2019ll give me a reason to hunt you down for it tomorrow morning,\u201d Harry smiled with mischief in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou think this is some knockoff Cinderella?\u201d You laughed.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d He shrugged and quickly got out the car before you could protest.</p><p>You shook your head happily and vowed to never let your shyness get in the way of things again.</p><p><i>[AN: this is the longest one I\u2019ve written in a while and I\u2019m glad I\u2019m getting over my writer\u2019s block. leave suggestions or anything really; my inbox is open]</i></p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h1>Looks Can Be Deceiving</h1><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><h2><i><b>[warnings: I guess a tiny bit of swearing but none tbh]</b></i></h2><p><i><b>summary: in which harry thinks y/n is mean and unapproachable</b></i></p><p><i><b>word count: 1,489</b></i></p><p>People always told you that you looked mean and unapproachable. People admitted to being too scared to approach you, scared they&rsquo;d be met with a bitchy attitude. They later would encourage other people to walk up and talk to you because you truly are the sweetest person they had ever met. You heard the many stories (of people thinking you were a bitch and you ended up being a sweetheart) all your life. But you couldn&rsquo;t help it, it was just your face.</p><p>Tonight was your best friend, Aurora&rsquo;s, birthday party that you had planned. You were super excited and wanted it to be the best night of her life. You wore a white sweater dress with a turtle neck, seeing how it was 24&deg;F in New York. You wore a gold Chanel chain belt around your waist and snake print boots. You didn&rsquo;t want to outshine the birthday girl so you stuck to a simple outfit thats was cute and still comfortable.</p><p>You were the first to show up to the party; you were adamant about this being a great night and was putting on the finishing touches when the guests started to arrive. They looked around in awe as they walked into an indoor garden. Aurora was always intrigued by nature and even has a little garden of her own (she&rsquo;d ditch you to tend to the garden all the time).</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s really gonna love this, Y/N!&rdquo; A friend of yours gasped and stared at the minimal butterflies flying around.</p><p>&ldquo;I really do hope so, &rsquo;ve planning it for months,&rdquo; You smiled and looked at your work.</p><p>You mingled and talked to the people you knew, too introverted to talk to those that you didn&rsquo;t know. When Liam came through the door with Aurora close behind you almost screamed with joy.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank goodness you guys are here, my social meter was about to run out!&rdquo; You gasped and pulled them into hugs. &ldquo;Happy birthday my baby!&rdquo; You squealed when you squeezed Aurora.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks Y/N. This place is wonderful. This is truly the most amazing place I&rsquo;ve been in, you really went all out for me,&rdquo; She smiled gratefully.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course, you&rsquo;re my best friend,&rdquo; You nodded.</p><p>While you were talking one of Liam&rsquo;s friends, Harry Styles, came up to him and you didn&rsquo;t mean to ignore him&hellip; but you did. You knew who he was and you did invite him but, you had never talked to him before or was ever even in the same room as him.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, we should go mingle a little before I&rsquo;m too drained. See you before the night&rsquo;s over, Li,&rdquo; You smiled and walked off, holding your best friend&rsquo;s hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Who was that?&rdquo; Harry scoffed as soon as you walked away.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, that was Y/N, Aurora&rsquo;s best friend. She&rsquo;s the one that set up the party,&rdquo; Liam explained.</p><p>&ldquo;And she didn&rsquo;t speak to me?&rdquo; Harry narrowed his eyes. He didn&rsquo;t meant to sound entitled but he thought it was just mannerly to speak to someone when you see them.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take it personal.
