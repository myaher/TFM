Dan&rsquo;d said that he would meet him at the station so there wouldn&rsquo;t be any confusion with anything else. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Hey! Phil! Over here!&rdquo; Dan called Phil turned to see where the voice was coming from, but he was rammed into and nearly knocked over before he could figure it out. As he steadied himself, he looked into the face of the person who had tried to knock him out, only to find that it was Dan himself. He relaxed and smiled at him. Dan looked down at Phil&rsquo;s hand as if to say &lt;em&gt;can I please hold it?&lt;/em&gt; Phil decided that there wasn&rsquo;t any harm in letting Dan hold his hand, so he laced his fingers through Dan&rsquo;s. Dan looked around at the busy station around them. No one seemed to be paying them any mind, and he &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wanted to kiss Phil. He let go of Phil&rsquo;s hand and grabbed hold of his belt loops to pull him in. &ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; he whispered, trying to sound a bit sexy, but figured he was probably failing. He was bad at sexy talk. His ex-fiancee made that much clear. He made it a point to be staring at Phil&rsquo;s lips. Phil shook his head so Dan let go of him. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Not here,&rdquo; Phil said. &ldquo;Famous YouTuber, my viewers could be anywhere and I don&rsquo;t trust them not to spread anything about AmazingPhil being caught wrapped up in a stranger&rsquo;s arms.&rdquo; Dan nodded because he did understand what Phil was saying and murmered a quick apology. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; Phil said back. He paused for a moment. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go back to your place, that way we can do whatever we want to do.&rdquo; Dan shrugged.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Yeah, I guess that works,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Just going to warn you though, I haven&rsquo;t been home in a week and my roommate isn&rsquo;t the cleanest person on the planet. Phil smiled.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;That&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo; Dan shrugged again and grabbed Phil&rsquo;s hand again. Phil squeezed his hand. He liked how his hand felt. As if like pieces of a puzzle that fit perfectly. None of his past boyfriends had ever felt like that when he had held their hands. He thought that this sort of feeling was just in romance novels, some standard that he shouldn&rsquo;t actually look for because it was impossible. Not like hand-holding was the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; thing to base relationships off of. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Dan ordered an uber so they could head back to his place and the app told him that the driver would be there to get them in a few minutes. He sighed and looked over to Phil. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;So what have you been doing these last few days?&rdquo; Dan asked him. Phil seemed distracted, but his attention went right to Dan as soon as the question was done.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;What?&rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;I asked you what you&rsquo;ve been up to these last few days,&rdquo; Dan said. &ldquo;Are you deaf?&rdquo; He teased. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Probably,&rdquo; Phil said. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve mostly been just working on that video.&rdquo; Phil sighed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a long time since I&rsquo;ve done one and I don&rsquo;t even know what people would want me to keep in it.&rdquo; Dan wanted to kiss him to assure him that he would do fine, but Phil had already made it pretty clear that PDA was a big no no. For now at least while they were still in the early stages and he didn&rsquo;t want to introduce Dan as his boyfriend &lt;em&gt;officially&lt;/em&gt;. If that&rsquo;s even what they were. He wasn&rsquo;t quite sure. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure people will love it no matter what,&rdquo; Dan said. &ldquo;And if they don&rsquo;t, well screw them you put your heart and soul into that video and as long as you&rsquo;re proud of it, that&rsquo;s all that matters.&rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Well this YouTube this is kind of my only source of income,&rdquo; Phil said. &ldquo;I think it very well &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; matter what the people think of it. If they hate it I don&rsquo;t make money.&rdquo; Dan rolled his eyes in reply. Their uber pulled up and let them into the car. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;I would bet you everything that I have that you can&rsquo;t do anything to make it fail bad enough that everyone hates it and you make no money,&rdquo; Dan said. Phil sighed.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right.&rdquo; He shook his head. &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re right, so why do I not believe it?&rdquo; They bucked their seatbelts and Dan gave the driver the address of his building. \u00a0&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re being dumb,&rdquo; Dan said. He noticed a stray hair on Phil&rsquo;s head and fixed it. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be that bad. You can show me what you&rsquo;ve got so far when we get back to my place,&rdquo; Dan said. Phil nodded and rested his head on Dan&rsquo;s shoulder. This wasn&rsquo;t something he was used to. Normally he was the one who put his head on his boyfriend&rsquo;s shoulder. He looked down and Phil had his eyes closed. &ldquo;Say you won&rsquo;t let go&rdquo; by James Arthur came on and the driver turned it up.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;This is my jam!&rdquo; she said and she started belting the lyrics. Dan smiled at Phil and lightly ran his hand down Phil&rsquo;s arm. He somehow couldn&rsquo;t help but feel the song was talking about him and Phil even though they hadn&rsquo;t known each other for very long. He felt a wave of joy that he hadn&rsquo;t felt in a long time. Not since he&rsquo;d proposed to his ex-fiancee and he&rsquo;d said yes. A feeling he thought that he&rsquo;d never feel again due to the nature of it. Why was it that Phil was able to make him feel so happy so easily?&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Once they reached Dan&rsquo;s building, they thanked the driver and Dan paid her for her time and the gas that she used. He grabbed Phil&rsquo;s hand and lead him upstairs to his apartment. He fumbled for the key outside of his door and opened it up. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Home sweet home,&rdquo; Dan said with a shrug. &ldquo;I know it isn&rsquo;t much but-&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Oh hush with that,&rdquo; Phil said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hear it.&rdquo; Phil looked around. Dan was right about it not being much, but he didn&rsquo;t mind at all. He knew that Dan was doing his best with the money that he had and he couldn&rsquo;t say anything bad about that. Not everyone had the privileges that he had as a YouTuber who was making a good amount of money. Besides, it was a decent place, it wasn&rsquo;t like there was rat shit everywhere. The only smell was from the kitchen and what looked like some sort of science experiment gone wrong. Dan groaned. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Sorry, my roommate thinks he&rsquo;s a chef.&rdquo; He rolled his eyes. &ldquo;A chef who can never clean up after himself. He walked over to the stove and turned it off so hopefully some of the smell would die off. &quot;Let&rsquo;s go to my room. It&rsquo;s in better shape than the rest of this place.&rdquo; Dan shook his head and blushed with embarrassment. He couldn&rsquo;t believe that he&rsquo;d actually let Phil see his home like this. His mother would &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; approve of his host skills. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;He shut and locked the door behind him (his roommate had an unfortunate habit of walking in his room without knocking). He realized that he really should have cleaned his room before he went to get Phil from the station. His bed wasn&rsquo;t made. His bag was still shoved in the corner, not put away at all. He had clothes (a mix of clean and dirty) strewn all over his floor from before his trip when he was desperately trying to find something to wear for the week that wasn&rsquo;t going to be &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; embarrassing. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;So where were we,&rdquo; Phil said, ignoring the mess in the room. All that mattered to him was Dan. He grabbed Dan by the belt loops, just as Dan had attempted earlier. He figured it was something Dan liked since he&rsquo;d done it. He put a kiss on the tip of Dan&rsquo;s nose. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve missed you,&rdquo; Dan said. He decided that he wanted Phil to make the first move towards the first &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; kiss of the day. Dan thought that dominance was hot. In some cases. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Why? I&rsquo;m not anything more special just because I&rsquo;m slightly famous,&rdquo; Phil replied. Dan smacked him.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;You know that&rsquo;s not why.&rdquo; Phil kissed him on the lips. Dan sighed and melted into the kiss. Phil broke the kiss and sat on the bed. &lt;br /&gt;</p><p>&ldquo;I was going to show you what I have.&rdquo; He smiled and pulled out his laptop Dan sat down beside him. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Oh right,&rdquo; Dan said, slightly disappointed that Phil hadn&rsquo;t kissed him again. He shook the feeling though because they had at \u00a0least an entire day to themselves before Phil would go back to Manchester. There would (hopefully) be more kisses to come. Phil pulled up the video and made sure his volume was up and hit play. Dan watched and tried to judge mostly based off of what a viewer might think of it, but all he could think of was the fun they&rsquo;d had in New York. Once the video was over, Phil looked at Dan with doubt written all over his face. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; Dan said. &ldquo;Just keep what you&rsquo;re doing. It just needs finished.&rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;You really think that it&rsquo;s good?&rdquo; Dan nodded.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;I would have told you that it was shit if it was shit,&rdquo; Dan replied, though he wasn&rsquo;t sure if that was a true statement because he didn&rsquo;t really want to tell Phil anything negative about something that he&rsquo;d clearly worked hard on. Phil smiled. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s finish it together than, shall we?&rdquo; Phil asked. Dan shook his head. &lt;br /&gt;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I should put anything into it, it&rsquo;s your video. Your idea. It&rsquo;s going on your channel. You just do whatever to it, I really don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; Dan said. Phil nodded.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Ok, I guess.&rdquo; He looked around the room. &ldquo;So what would you rather do then?&rdquo; Dan&rsquo;s mind went to a dark hole that he knew wasn&rsquo;t an appropriate place to be with someone he&rsquo;s only recently met. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said instead of telling Phil what was actually going through his head. He didn&rsquo;t want Phil to think anything bad about him, even if his thoughts weren&rsquo;t exactly \u00a0pure at the moment. Phil shrugged and decided to work on the video. It&rsquo;d been a while since his audience had gotten one from him, and if Dan thought it was good, he should probably finish it so they could have a new video. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Well when you figure it out, let me know,&rdquo; Phil said. &ldquo;I did all the planning in New York. We&rsquo;re in your turf now, it&rsquo;s your turn to pick what we do.&rdquo; Dan sighed. He honestly couldn&rsquo;t even think of anything to do in London besides eating and going on the London Eye, neither of which were very appealing at the moment. Dan snuggled into Phil and put his head on Phil&rsquo;s shoulder. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t we just hang out here?&rdquo; Phil raised an eyebrow at him but didn&rsquo;t say anything, determined to finish the video if Dan wasn&rsquo;t going to come up with an actual activity to do. He was fine with just hanging out like this anyway. Having Dan there would probably make the video take longer, but he knew it would be worth it. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;We can, I suppose,&rdquo; Phil said. He looked to Dan then back to the video and sighed. He put his laptop away, deciding that it would be better if he put all of his attention to Dan. He hadn&rsquo;t seen him him in a few days anyway. He would never get the day back, so he should probably make the most of it. &ldquo;What did you have in mind?&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Talking and sharing our deepest secrets is a fun place to start,&rdquo; Dan said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll start. I almost got married to a man and my family doesn&rsquo;t even know that I&rsquo;m gay yet.&rdquo; Phil raised his eyebrows. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;You did what now?&rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;You heard me.&rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;And your parents still don&rsquo;t know you&rsquo;re gay?&rdquo; Phil shook his head. &ldquo;Who did they think he was when you brought him around to the house?&rdquo; Dan shook his head.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;They never met him,&rdquo; Dan said. Phil stared at him like he was insane.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;And you were going to marry this dude?&rdquo; Dan shrugged.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;I suppose we broke up for a reason.&rdquo; Phil rolled his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell them? You obviously used to be crazy about this guy, why didn&rsquo;t you tell them before you got engaged to a guy.&rdquo; Dan sighed.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;I feel like my mom is going to be very disappointed in me for it. She&rsquo;s already not proud of me as it is. I mean look at me. I&rsquo;m a lawyer, but I have to have a roommate just to afford a decent apartment. I work my ass off for everything I have, and I still don&rsquo;t have much. Plus she really wants grandkids from me and well,&rdquo; Dan gestured to himself. &ldquo;I obviously can&rsquo;t give them to her myself.&rdquo; He shook his head and squeezed his eyes shut as a way to fight back the tears. Part of him knew that some of that was irrational. At the same time, it wasn&rsquo;t because some of it was very real. Phil wrapped his arms around Dan and held him tight. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure none of that is true and your parents love you very much,&rdquo; Phil replied. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Love has nothing to do with pride,&rdquo; Dan said. &ldquo;And my parents aren&rsquo;t nearly as proud of me as they are in my little brother. I can&rsquo;t throw being gay in on top of that unless I can find a boyfriend who can make them proud.&rdquo; Phil kissed Dan&rsquo;s cheek. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;If your &lt;em&gt;boyfriend&lt;/em&gt; becomes what your parents are proud of, you&rsquo;re only going to feel worse about yourself Dan,&rdquo; Phil said softly. &ldquo;But if you want them to be proud of you, you really need to be proud of &lt;em&gt;yourself &lt;/em&gt; first. Have so much pride in yourself that you don&rsquo;t need you parents&rsquo; approval, but it&rsquo;s just an added bonus.&rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Easier said than done Mr. Millionaire,&rdquo; Dan said. Phil let go of Dan to cross his arms over his chest. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right Dan, I do make a lot of money,&rdquo; Phil said. &ldquo;But that is not where I find my pride. My pride comes in that the reason I make so much is that I&rsquo;m just making fun little videos for the internet. I do everything for those videos and people appreciate them so much that I&rsquo;m able to make a living off of it.&rdquo; Phil didn&rsquo;t want to tell him just how much money he made because he didn&rsquo;t want Dan to feel worse. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve just got to find something within yourself to be proud of for yourself. Anything.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Well I graduated college,&rdquo; Dan said. Phil nodded.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Yes you did. Is that something you&rsquo;re actually proud of?&rdquo; Dan sighed.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;No, not really.&rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Then it doesn&rsquo;t count.&rdquo; Phil pulled out his laptop so he could work on his video and give Dan space to think. He knew for a fact that Dan had to have &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; in his life that he was proud of, no matter how small, and he was determined to make Dan see that and even feel just a bit of pride. Sometimes pride was a bad thing, but there was nothing wrong with just a touch of it to lead to a happier life. Dan wasn&rsquo;t able to come up with anything that he was actually proud of. He&rsquo;d proposed to a guy. Yeah, cool, but he wasn&rsquo;t the right guy he should have been getting engaged to and he never even told his parents that he&rsquo;d been dating the guy, let alone the fact that he&rsquo;d wanted to &lt;em&gt;marry &lt;/em&gt;the guy. Maybe if his family had been involved with that, he wouldn&rsquo;t have even gotten engaged in the first place and had himself set up to have his heart broken. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to come out to my family,&rdquo; Dan said. &ldquo;All at once. I am going to be out and proud of being gay and I am going to be proud of myself for finally telling them about this part of who I am,&rdquo; Dan said. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good place to start,&rdquo; Phil said. &ldquo;When are you going to do it?&rdquo; He knew that if Dan didn&rsquo;t make a plan, it wouldn&rsquo;t happen. It&rsquo;s how he himself got around to coming out. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;This weekend,&rdquo; Dan said, already texting his parents to ask them if they were free for dinner that Saturday at his place. He texted his brother next, deciding that it would be best if he just invited them all to find out at one time. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Do you want me to be here to support you?&rdquo; Phil asked. Dan shook his head.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;No, thanks for the offer though. No offence, but I&rsquo;m not ready to introduce you to the family yet.&rdquo; Phil shrugged.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;None taken. I get it. We haven&rsquo;t known each other for very long and are only in the early stages of getting to know each other in the first place.&rdquo; He meant it when he said this. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;The pair spent the rest of the day just talking about nothing important with occasional kisses and helping to plan how Dan was going to come out. This was a big step in the right direction, Phil knew. Dan was going to get his life put on a track that he actually wanted it to go down rather than one that everyone else wanted it to go down. &lt;/p&gt;</p>",

Dan\u2019d said that he would meet him at the station so there wouldn\u2019t be any confusion with anything else. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cHey! Phil! Over here!\u201d Dan called Phil turned to see where the voice was coming from, but he was rammed into and nearly knocked over before he could figure it out. As he steadied himself, he looked into the face of the person who had tried to knock him out, only to find that it was Dan himself. He relaxed and smiled at him. Dan looked down at Phil\u2019s hand as if to say &lt;em&gt;can I please hold it?&lt;/em&gt; Phil decided that there wasn\u2019t any harm in letting Dan hold his hand, so he laced his fingers through Dan\u2019s. Dan looked around at the busy station around them. No one seemed to be paying them any mind, and he &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wanted to kiss Phil. He let go of Phil\u2019s hand and grabbed hold of his belt loops to pull him in. \u201cHey,\u201d he whispered, trying to sound a bit sexy, but figured he was probably failing. He was bad at sexy talk. His ex-fiancee made that much clear. He made it a point to be staring at Phil\u2019s lips. Phil shook his head so Dan let go of him. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cNot here,\u201d Phil said. \u201cFamous YouTuber, my viewers could be anywhere and I don\u2019t trust them not to spread anything about AmazingPhil being caught wrapped up in a stranger\u2019s arms.\u201d Dan nodded because he did understand what Phil was saying and murmered a quick apology. \u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Phil said back. He paused for a moment. \u201cLet\u2019s go back to your place, that way we can do whatever we want to do.\u201d Dan shrugged.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cYeah, I guess that works,\u201d he said. \u201cJust going to warn you though, I haven\u2019t been home in a week and my roommate isn\u2019t the cleanest person on the planet. Phil smiled.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\"That\u2019s fine.\u201d Dan shrugged again and grabbed Phil\u2019s hand again. Phil squeezed his hand. He liked how his hand felt. As if like pieces of a puzzle that fit perfectly. None of his past boyfriends had ever felt like that when he had held their hands. He thought that this sort of feeling was just in romance novels, some standard that he shouldn\u2019t actually look for because it was impossible. Not like hand-holding was the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; thing to base relationships off of. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Dan ordered an uber so they could head back to his place and the app told him that the driver would be there to get them in a few minutes. He sighed and looked over to Phil. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cSo what have you been doing these last few days?\u201d Dan asked him. Phil seemed distracted, but his attention went right to Dan as soon as the question was done.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat?\u201d &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cI asked you what you\u2019ve been up to these last few days,\u201d Dan said. \u201cAre you deaf?\u201d He teased. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cProbably,\u201d Phil said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve mostly been just working on that video.\u201d Phil sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve done one and I don\u2019t even know what people would want me to keep in it.\u201d Dan wanted to kiss him to assure him that he would do fine, but Phil had already made it pretty clear that PDA was a big no no. For now at least while they were still in the early stages and he didn\u2019t want to introduce Dan as his boyfriend &lt;em&gt;officially&lt;/em&gt;. If that\u2019s even what they were. He wasn\u2019t quite sure. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2019m sure people will love it no matter what,\u201d Dan said. \u201cAnd if they don\u2019t, well screw them you put your heart and soul into that video and as long as you\u2019re proud of it, that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cWell this YouTube this is kind of my only source of income,\u201d Phil said. \u201cI think it very well &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; matter what the people think of it. If they hate it I don\u2019t make money.\u201d Dan rolled his eyes in reply. Their uber pulled up and let them into the car. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cI would bet you everything that I have that you can\u2019t do anything to make it fail bad enough that everyone hates it and you make no money,\u201d Dan said. Phil sighed.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI know you\u2019re right, so why do I not believe it?\u201d They bucked their seatbelts and Dan gave the driver the address of his building. \u00a0&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cBecause you\u2019re being dumb,\u201d Dan said. He noticed a stray hair on Phil\u2019s head and fixed it. \u201cIt can\u2019t be that bad. You can show me what you\u2019ve got so far when we get back to my place,\u201d Dan said. Phil nodded and rested his head on Dan\u2019s shoulder. This wasn\u2019t something he was used to. Normally he was the one who put his head on his boyfriend\u2019s shoulder. He looked down and Phil had his eyes closed. \u201cSay you won\u2019t let go\u201d by James Arthur came on and the driver turned it up.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cThis is my jam!\u201d she said and she started belting the lyrics. Dan smiled at Phil and lightly ran his hand down Phil\u2019s arm. He somehow couldn\u2019t help but feel the song was talking about him and Phil even though they hadn\u2019t known each other for very long. He felt a wave of joy that he hadn\u2019t felt in a long time. Not since he\u2019d proposed to his ex-fiancee and he\u2019d said yes. A feeling he thought that he\u2019d never feel again due to the nature of it. Why was it that Phil was able to make him feel so happy so easily?&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Once they reached Dan\u2019s building, they thanked the driver and Dan paid her for her time and the gas that she used. He grabbed Phil\u2019s hand and lead him upstairs to his apartment. He fumbled for the key outside of his door and opened it up. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cHome sweet home,\u201d Dan said with a shrug. \u201cI know it isn\u2019t much but-\u201d&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh hush with that,\u201d Phil said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear it.\u201d Phil looked around. Dan was right about it not being much, but he didn\u2019t mind at all. He knew that Dan was doing his best with the money that he had and he couldn\u2019t say anything bad about that. Not everyone had the privileges that he had as a YouTuber who was making a good amount of money. Besides, it was a decent place, it wasn\u2019t like there was rat shit everywhere. The only smell was from the kitchen and what looked like some sort of science experiment gone wrong. Dan groaned. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cSorry, my roommate thinks he\u2019s a chef.\u201d He rolled his eyes. \u201cA chef who can never clean up after himself. He walked over to the stove and turned it off so hopefully some of the smell would die off. \"Let\u2019s go to my room. It\u2019s in better shape than the rest of this place.\u201d Dan shook his head and blushed with embarrassment. He couldn\u2019t believe that he\u2019d actually let Phil see his home like this. His mother would &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; approve of his host skills. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;He shut and locked the door behind him (his roommate had an unfortunate habit of walking in his room without knocking). He realized that he really should have cleaned his room before he went to get Phil from the station. His bed wasn\u2019t made. His bag was still shoved in the corner, not put away at all. He had clothes (a mix of clean and dirty) strewn all over his floor from before his trip when he was desperately trying to find something to wear for the week that wasn\u2019t going to be &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; embarrassing. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cSo where were we,\u201d Phil said, ignoring the mess in the room. All that mattered to him was Dan. He grabbed Dan by the belt loops, just as Dan had attempted earlier. He figured it was something Dan liked since he\u2019d done it. He put a kiss on the tip of Dan\u2019s nose. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2019ve missed you,\u201d Dan said. He decided that he wanted Phil to make the first move towards the first &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; kiss of the day. Dan thought that dominance was hot. In some cases. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhy? I\u2019m not anything more special just because I\u2019m slightly famous,\u201d Phil replied. Dan smacked him.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou know that\u2019s not why.\u201d Phil kissed him on the lips. Dan sighed and melted into the kiss. Phil broke the kiss and sat on the bed. &lt;br /&gt;</p><p>\u201cI was going to show you what I have.\u201d He smiled and pulled out his laptop Dan sat down beside him. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh right,\u201d Dan said, slightly disappointed that Phil hadn\u2019t kissed him again. He shook the feeling though because they had at \u00a0least an entire day to themselves before Phil would go back to Manchester. There would (hopefully) be more kisses to come. Phil pulled up the video and made sure his volume was up and hit play. Dan watched and tried to judge mostly based off of what a viewer might think of it, but all he could think of was the fun they\u2019d had in New York. Once the video was over, Phil looked at Dan with doubt written all over his face. \u201cIt\u2019s good,\u201d Dan said. \u201cJust keep what you\u2019re doing. It just needs finished.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou really think that it\u2019s good?\u201d Dan nodded.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cI would have told you that it was shit if it was shit,\u201d Dan replied, though he wasn\u2019t sure if that was a true statement because he didn\u2019t really want to tell Phil anything negative about something that he\u2019d clearly worked hard on. Phil smiled. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cLet\u2019s finish it together than, shall we?\u201d Phil asked. Dan shook his head. &lt;br /&gt;</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I should put anything into it, it\u2019s your video. Your idea. It\u2019s going on your channel. You just do whatever to it, I really don\u2019t care,\u201d Dan said. Phil nodded.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cOk, I guess.\u201d He looked around the room. \u201cSo what would you rather do then?\u201d Dan\u2019s mind went to a dark hole that he knew wasn\u2019t an appropriate place to be with someone he\u2019s only recently met. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said instead of telling Phil what was actually going through his head. He didn\u2019t want Phil to think anything bad about him, even if his thoughts weren\u2019t exactly \u00a0pure at the moment. Phil shrugged and decided to work on the video. It\u2019d been a while since his audience had gotten one from him, and if Dan thought it was good, he should probably finish it so they could have a new video. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cWell when you figure it out, let me know,\u201d Phil said. \u201cI did all the planning in New York. We\u2019re in your turf now, it\u2019s your turn to pick what we do.\u201d Dan sighed. He honestly couldn\u2019t even think of anything to do in London besides eating and going on the London Eye, neither of which were very appealing at the moment. Dan snuggled into Phil and put his head on Phil\u2019s shoulder. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhy can\u2019t we just hang out here?\u201d Phil raised an eyebrow at him but didn\u2019t say anything, determined to finish the video if Dan wasn\u2019t going to come up with an actual activity to do. He was fine with just hanging out like this anyway. Having Dan there would probably make the video take longer, but he knew it would be worth it. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe can, I suppose,\u201d Phil said. He looked to Dan then back to the video and sighed. He put his laptop away, deciding that it would be better if he put all of his attention to Dan. He hadn\u2019t seen him him in a few days anyway. He would never get the day back, so he should probably make the most of it. \u201cWhat did you have in mind?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cTalking and sharing our deepest secrets is a fun place to start,\u201d Dan said. \u201cI\u2019ll start. I almost got married to a man and my family doesn\u2019t even know that I\u2019m gay yet.\u201d Phil raised his eyebrows. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou did what now?\u201d &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou heard me.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cAnd your parents still don\u2019t know you\u2019re gay?\u201d Phil shook his head. \u201cWho did they think he was when you brought him around to the house?\u201d Dan shook his head.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cThey never met him,\u201d Dan said. Phil stared at him like he was insane.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cAnd you were going to marry this dude?\u201d Dan shrugged.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cI suppose we broke up for a reason.\u201d Phil rolled his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell them? You obviously used to be crazy about this guy, why didn\u2019t you tell them before you got engaged to a guy.\u201d Dan sighed.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cI feel like my mom is going to be very disappointed in me for it. She\u2019s already not proud of me as it is. I mean look at me. I\u2019m a lawyer, but I have to have a roommate just to afford a decent apartment. I work my ass off for everything I have, and I still don\u2019t have much. Plus she really wants grandkids from me and well,\u201d Dan gestured to himself. \u201cI obviously can\u2019t give them to her myself.\u201d He shook his head and squeezed his eyes shut as a way to fight back the tears. Part of him knew that some of that was irrational. At the same time, it wasn\u2019t because some of it was very real. Phil wrapped his arms around Dan and held him tight. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2019m sure none of that is true and your parents love you very much,\u201d Phil replied. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cLove has nothing to do with pride,\u201d Dan said. \u201cAnd my parents aren\u2019t nearly as proud of me as they are in my little brother. I can\u2019t throw being gay in on top of that unless I can find a boyfriend who can make them proud.\u201d Phil kissed Dan\u2019s cheek. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cIf your &lt;em&gt;boyfriend&lt;/em&gt; becomes what your parents are proud of, you\u2019re only going to feel worse about yourself Dan,\u201d Phil said softly. \u201cBut if you want them to be proud of you, you really need to be proud of &lt;em&gt;yourself &lt;/em&gt; first. Have so much pride in yourself that you don\u2019t need you parents\u2019 approval, but it\u2019s just an added bonus.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cEasier said than done Mr. Millionaire,\u201d Dan said. Phil let go of Dan to cross his arms over his chest. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou\u2019re right Dan, I do make a lot of money,\u201d Phil said. \u201cBut that is not where I find my pride. My pride comes in that the reason I make so much is that I\u2019m just making fun little videos for the internet. I do everything for those videos and people appreciate them so much that I\u2019m able to make a living off of it.\u201d Phil didn\u2019t want to tell him just how much money he made because he didn\u2019t want Dan to feel worse. \u201cYou\u2019ve just got to find something within yourself to be proud of for yourself. Anything.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cWell I graduated college,\u201d Dan said. Phil nodded.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cYes you did. Is that something you\u2019re actually proud of?\u201d Dan sighed.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo, not really.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cThen it doesn\u2019t count.\u201d Phil pulled out his laptop so he could work on his video and give Dan space to think. He knew for a fact that Dan had to have &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; in his life that he was proud of, no matter how small, and he was determined to make Dan see that and even feel just a bit of pride. Sometimes pride was a bad thing, but there was nothing wrong with just a touch of it to lead to a happier life. Dan wasn\u2019t able to come up with anything that he was actually proud of. He\u2019d proposed to a guy. Yeah, cool, but he wasn\u2019t the right guy he should have been getting engaged to and he never even told his parents that he\u2019d been dating the guy, let alone the fact that he\u2019d wanted to &lt;em&gt;marry &lt;/em&gt;the guy. Maybe if his family had been involved with that, he wouldn\u2019t have even gotten engaged in the first place and had himself set up to have his heart broken. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2019m going to come out to my family,\u201d Dan said. \u201cAll at once. I am going to be out and proud of being gay and I am going to be proud of myself for finally telling them about this part of who I am,\u201d Dan said. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cThat\u2019s a good place to start,\u201d Phil said. \u201cWhen are you going to do it?\u201d He knew that if Dan didn\u2019t make a plan, it wouldn\u2019t happen. It\u2019s how he himself got around to coming out. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cThis weekend,\u201d Dan said, already texting his parents to ask them if they were free for dinner that Saturday at his place. He texted his brother next, deciding that it would be best if he just invited them all to find out at one time. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cDo you want me to be here to support you?\u201d Phil asked. Dan shook his head.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo, thanks for the offer though. No offence, but I\u2019m not ready to introduce you to the family yet.\u201d Phil shrugged.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cNone taken. I get it. We haven\u2019t known each other for very long and are only in the early stages of getting to know each other in the first place.\u201d He meant it when he said this. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;The pair spent the rest of the day just talking about nothing important with occasional kisses and helping to plan how Dan was going to come out. This was a big step in the right direction, Phil knew. Dan was going to get his life put on a track that he actually wanted it to go down rather than one that everyone else wanted it to go down. &lt;/p&gt;</p></p>",

Dan\u2019d said that he would meet him at the station so there wouldn\u2019t be any confusion with anything else. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cHey! Phil! Over here!\u201d Dan called Phil turned to see where the voice was coming from, but he was rammed into and nearly knocked over before he could figure it out. As he steadied himself, he looked into the face of the person who had tried to knock him out, only to find that it was Dan himself. He relaxed and smiled at him. Dan looked down at Phil\u2019s hand as if to say &lt;em&gt;can I please hold it?&lt;/em&gt; Phil decided that there wasn\u2019t any harm in letting Dan hold his hand, so he laced his fingers through Dan\u2019s. Dan looked around at the busy station around them. No one seemed to be paying them any mind, and he &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wanted to kiss Phil. He let go of Phil\u2019s hand and grabbed hold of his belt loops to pull him in. \u201cHey,\u201d he whispered, trying to sound a bit sexy, but figured he was probably failing. He was bad at sexy talk. His ex-fiancee made that much clear. He made it a point to be staring at Phil\u2019s lips. Phil shook his head so Dan let go of him. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cNot here,\u201d Phil said. \u201cFamous YouTuber, my viewers could be anywhere and I don\u2019t trust them not to spread anything about AmazingPhil being caught wrapped up in a stranger\u2019s arms.\u201d Dan nodded because he did understand what Phil was saying and murmered a quick apology. \u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Phil said back. He paused for a moment. \u201cLet\u2019s go back to your place, that way we can do whatever we want to do.\u201d Dan shrugged.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cYeah, I guess that works,\u201d he said. \u201cJust going to warn you though, I haven\u2019t been home in a week and my roommate isn\u2019t the cleanest person on the planet. Phil smiled.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\"That\u2019s fine.\u201d Dan shrugged again and grabbed Phil\u2019s hand again. Phil squeezed his hand. He liked how his hand felt. As if like pieces of a puzzle that fit perfectly. None of his past boyfriends had ever felt like that when he had held their hands. He thought that this sort of feeling was just in romance novels, some standard that he shouldn\u2019t actually look for because it was impossible. Not like hand-holding was the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; thing to base relationships off of. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Dan ordered an uber so they could head back to his place and the app told him that the driver would be there to get them in a few minutes. He sighed and looked over to Phil. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cSo what have you been doing these last few days?\u201d Dan asked him. Phil seemed distracted, but his attention went right to Dan as soon as the question was done.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat?\u201d &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cI asked you what you\u2019ve been up to these last few days,\u201d Dan said. \u201cAre you deaf?\u201d He teased. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cProbably,\u201d Phil said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve mostly been just working on that video.\u201d Phil sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve done one and I don\u2019t even know what people would want me to keep in it.\u201d Dan wanted to kiss him to assure him that he would do fine, but Phil had already made it pretty clear that PDA was a big no no. For now at least while they were still in the early stages and he didn\u2019t want to introduce Dan as his boyfriend &lt;em&gt;officially&lt;/em&gt;. If that\u2019s even what they were. He wasn\u2019t quite sure. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2019m sure people will love it no matter what,\u201d Dan said. \u201cAnd if they don\u2019t, well screw them you put your heart and soul into that video and as long as you\u2019re proud of it, that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cWell this YouTube this is kind of my only source of income,\u201d Phil said. \u201cI think it very well &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; matter what the people think of it. If they hate it I don\u2019t make money.\u201d Dan rolled his eyes in reply. Their uber pulled up and let them into the car. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cI would bet you everything that I have that you can\u2019t do anything to make it fail bad enough that everyone hates it and you make no money,\u201d Dan said. Phil sighed.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI know you\u2019re right, so why do I not believe it?\u201d They bucked their seatbelts and Dan gave the driver the address of his building. \u00a0&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cBecause you\u2019re being dumb,\u201d Dan said. He noticed a stray hair on Phil\u2019s head and fixed it. \u201cIt can\u2019t be that bad. You can show me what you\u2019ve got so far when we get back to my place,\u201d Dan said. Phil nodded and rested his head on Dan\u2019s shoulder. This wasn\u2019t something he was used to. Normally he was the one who put his head on his boyfriend\u2019s shoulder. He looked down and Phil had his eyes closed. \u201cSay you won\u2019t let go\u201d by James Arthur came on and the driver turned it up.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cThis is my jam!\u201d she said and she started belting the lyrics. Dan smiled at Phil and lightly ran his hand down Phil\u2019s arm. He somehow couldn\u2019t help but feel the song was talking about him and Phil even though they hadn\u2019t known each other for very long. He felt a wave of joy that he hadn\u2019t felt in a long time. Not since he\u2019d proposed to his ex-fiancee and he\u2019d said yes. A feeling he thought that he\u2019d never feel again due to the nature of it. Why was it that Phil was able to make him feel so happy so easily?&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Once they reached Dan\u2019s building, they thanked the driver and Dan paid her for her time and the gas that she used. He grabbed Phil\u2019s hand and lead him upstairs to his apartment. He fumbled for the key outside of his door and opened it up. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cHome sweet home,\u201d Dan said with a shrug. \u201cI know it isn\u2019t much but-\u201d&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh hush with that,\u201d Phil said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear it.\u201d Phil looked around. Dan was right about it not being much, but he didn\u2019t mind at all. He knew that Dan was doing his best with the money that he had and he couldn\u2019t say anything bad about that. Not everyone had the privileges that he had as a YouTuber who was making a good amount of money. Besides, it was a decent place, it wasn\u2019t like there was rat shit everywhere. The only smell was from the kitchen and what looked like some sort of science experiment gone wrong. Dan groaned. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cSorry, my roommate thinks he\u2019s a chef.\u201d He rolled his eyes. \u201cA chef who can never clean up after himself. He walked over to the stove and turned it off so hopefully some of the smell would die off. \"Let\u2019s go to my room. It\u2019s in better shape than the rest of this place.\u201d Dan shook his head and blushed with embarrassment. He couldn\u2019t believe that he\u2019d actually let Phil see his home like this. His mother would &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; approve of his host skills. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;He shut and locked the door behind him (his roommate had an unfortunate habit of walking in his room without knocking). He realized that he really should have cleaned his room before he went to get Phil from the station. His bed wasn\u2019t made. His bag was still shoved in the corner, not put away at all. He had clothes (a mix of clean and dirty) strewn all over his floor from before his trip when he was desperately trying to find something to wear for the week that wasn\u2019t going to be &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; embarrassing. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cSo where were we,\u201d Phil said, ignoring the mess in the room. All that mattered to him was Dan. He grabbed Dan by the belt loops, just as Dan had attempted earlier. He figured it was something Dan liked since he\u2019d done it. He put a kiss on the tip of Dan\u2019s nose. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2019ve missed you,\u201d Dan said. He decided that he wanted Phil to make the first move towards the first &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; kiss of the day. Dan thought that dominance was hot. In some cases. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhy? I\u2019m not anything more special just because I\u2019m slightly famous,\u201d Phil replied. Dan smacked him.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou know that\u2019s not why.\u201d Phil kissed him on the lips. Dan sighed and melted into the kiss. Phil broke the kiss and sat on the bed. &lt;br /&gt;</p><p>\u201cI was going to show you what I have.\u201d He smiled and pulled out his laptop Dan sat down beside him. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh right,\u201d Dan said, slightly disappointed that Phil hadn\u2019t kissed him again. He shook the feeling though because they had at \u00a0least an entire day to themselves before Phil would go back to Manchester. There would (hopefully) be more kisses to come. Phil pulled up the video and made sure his volume was up and hit play. Dan watched and tried to judge mostly based off of what a viewer might think of it, but all he could think of was the fun they\u2019d had in New York. Once the video was over, Phil looked at Dan with doubt written all over his face. \u201cIt\u2019s good,\u201d Dan said. \u201cJust keep what you\u2019re doing. It just needs finished.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou really think that it\u2019s good?\u201d Dan nodded.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cI would have told you that it was shit if it was shit,\u201d Dan replied, though he wasn\u2019t sure if that was a true statement because he didn\u2019t really want to tell Phil anything negative about something that he\u2019d clearly worked hard on. Phil smiled. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cLet\u2019s finish it together than, shall we?\u201d Phil asked. Dan shook his head. &lt;br /&gt;</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I should put anything into it, it\u2019s your video. Your idea. It\u2019s going on your channel. You just do whatever to it, I really don\u2019t care,\u201d Dan said. Phil nodded.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cOk, I guess.\u201d He looked around the room. \u201cSo what would you rather do then?\u201d Dan\u2019s mind went to a dark hole that he knew wasn\u2019t an appropriate place to be with someone he\u2019s only recently met. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said instead of telling Phil what was actually going through his head. He didn\u2019t want Phil to think anything bad about him, even if his thoughts weren\u2019t exactly \u00a0pure at the moment. Phil shrugged and decided to work on the video. It\u2019d been a while since his audience had gotten one from him, and if Dan thought it was good, he should probably finish it so they could have a new video. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cWell when you figure it out, let me know,\u201d Phil said. \u201cI did all the planning in New York. We\u2019re in your turf now, it\u2019s your turn to pick what we do.\u201d Dan sighed. He honestly couldn\u2019t even think of anything to do in London besides eating and going on the London Eye, neither of which were very appealing at the moment. Dan snuggled into Phil and put his head on Phil\u2019s shoulder. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhy can\u2019t we just hang out here?\u201d Phil raised an eyebrow at him but didn\u2019t say anything, determined to finish the video if Dan wasn\u2019t going to come up with an actual activity to do. He was fine with just hanging out like this anyway. Having Dan there would probably make the video take longer, but he knew it would be worth it. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe can, I suppose,\u201d Phil said. He looked to Dan then back to the video and sighed. He put his laptop away, deciding that it would be better if he put all of his attention to Dan. He hadn\u2019t seen him him in a few days anyway. He would never get the day back, so he should probably make the most of it. \u201cWhat did you have in mind?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cTalking and sharing our deepest secrets is a fun place to start,\u201d Dan said. \u201cI\u2019ll start. I almost got married to a man and my family doesn\u2019t even know that I\u2019m gay yet.\u201d Phil raised his eyebrows. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou did what now?\u201d &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou heard me.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cAnd your parents still don\u2019t know you\u2019re gay?\u201d Phil shook his head. \u201cWho did they think he was when you brought him around to the house?\u201d Dan shook his head.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cThey never met him,\u201d Dan said. Phil stared at him like he was insane.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cAnd you were going to marry this dude?\u201d Dan shrugged.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cI suppose we broke up for a reason.\u201d Phil rolled his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell them? You obviously used to be crazy about this guy, why didn\u2019t you tell them before you got engaged to a guy.\u201d Dan sighed.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cI feel like my mom is going to be very disappointed in me for it. She\u2019s already not proud of me as it is. I mean look at me. I\u2019m a lawyer, but I have to have a roommate just to afford a decent apartment. I work my ass off for everything I have, and I still don\u2019t have much. Plus she really wants grandkids from me and well,\u201d Dan gestured to himself. \u201cI obviously can\u2019t give them to her myself.\u201d He shook his head and squeezed his eyes shut as a way to fight back the tears. Part of him knew that some of that was irrational. At the same time, it wasn\u2019t because some of it was very real. Phil wrapped his arms around Dan and held him tight. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2019m sure none of that is true and your parents love you very much,\u201d Phil replied. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cLove has nothing to do with pride,\u201d Dan said. \u201cAnd my parents aren\u2019t nearly as proud of me as they are in my little brother. I can\u2019t throw being gay in on top of that unless I can find a boyfriend who can make them proud.\u201d Phil kissed Dan\u2019s cheek. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cIf your &lt;em&gt;boyfriend&lt;/em&gt; becomes what your parents are proud of, you\u2019re only going to feel worse about yourself Dan,\u201d Phil said softly. \u201cBut if you want them to be proud of you, you really need to be proud of &lt;em&gt;yourself &lt;/em&gt; first. Have so much pride in yourself that you don\u2019t need you parents\u2019 approval, but it\u2019s just an added bonus.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cEasier said than done Mr. Millionaire,\u201d Dan said. Phil let go of Dan to cross his arms over his chest. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou\u2019re right Dan, I do make a lot of money,\u201d Phil said. \u201cBut that is not where I find my pride. My pride comes in that the reason I make so much is that I\u2019m just making fun little videos for the internet. I do everything for those videos and people appreciate them so much that I\u2019m able to make a living off of it.\u201d Phil didn\u2019t want to tell him just how much money he made because he didn\u2019t want Dan to feel worse. \u201cYou\u2019ve just got to find something within yourself to be proud of for yourself. Anything.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cWell I graduated college,\u201d Dan said. Phil nodded.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cYes you did. Is that something you\u2019re actually proud of?\u201d Dan sighed.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo, not really.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cThen it doesn\u2019t count.\u201d Phil pulled out his laptop so he could work on his video and give Dan space to think. He knew for a fact that Dan had to have &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; in his life that he was proud of, no matter how small, and he was determined to make Dan see that and even feel just a bit of pride. Sometimes pride was a bad thing, but there was nothing wrong with just a touch of it to lead to a happier life. Dan wasn\u2019t able to come up with anything that he was actually proud of. He\u2019d proposed to a guy. Yeah, cool, but he wasn\u2019t the right guy he should have been getting engaged to and he never even told his parents that he\u2019d been dating the guy, let alone the fact that he\u2019d wanted to &lt;em&gt;marry &lt;/em&gt;the guy. Maybe if his family had been involved with that, he wouldn\u2019t have even gotten engaged in the first place and had himself set up to have his heart broken. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2019m going to come out to my family,\u201d Dan said. \u201cAll at once. I am going to be out and proud of being gay and I am going to be proud of myself for finally telling them about this part of who I am,\u201d Dan said. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cThat\u2019s a good place to start,\u201d Phil said. \u201cWhen are you going to do it?\u201d He knew that if Dan didn\u2019t make a plan, it wouldn\u2019t happen. It\u2019s how he himself got around to coming out. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cThis weekend,\u201d Dan said, already texting his parents to ask them if they were free for dinner that Saturday at his place. He texted his brother next, deciding that it would be best if he just invited them all to find out at one time. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cDo you want me to be here to support you?\u201d Phil asked. Dan shook his head.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo, thanks for the offer though. No offence, but I\u2019m not ready to introduce you to the family yet.\u201d Phil shrugged.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\u201cNone taken. I get it. We haven\u2019t known each other for very long and are only in the early stages of getting to know each other in the first place.\u201d He meant it when he said this. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;The pair spent the rest of the day just talking about nothing important with occasional kisses and helping to plan how Dan was going to come out. This was a big step in the right direction, Phil knew. Dan was going to get his life put on a track that he actually wanted it to go down rather than one that everyone else wanted it to go down. &lt;/p&gt;</p></p>",

Dan&rsquo;d said that he would meet him at the station so there wouldn&rsquo;t be any confusion with anything else. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Hey! Phil! Over here!&rdquo; Dan called Phil turned to see where the voice was coming from, but he was rammed into and nearly knocked over before he could figure it out. As he steadied himself, he looked into the face of the person who had tried to knock him out, only to find that it was Dan himself. He relaxed and smiled at him. Dan looked down at Phil&rsquo;s hand as if to say &lt;em&gt;can I please hold it?&lt;/em&gt; Phil decided that there wasn&rsquo;t any harm in letting Dan hold his hand, so he laced his fingers through Dan&rsquo;s. Dan looked around at the busy station around them. No one seemed to be paying them any mind, and he &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wanted to kiss Phil. He let go of Phil&rsquo;s hand and grabbed hold of his belt loops to pull him in. &ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; he whispered, trying to sound a bit sexy, but figured he was probably failing. He was bad at sexy talk. His ex-fiancee made that much clear. He made it a point to be staring at Phil&rsquo;s lips. Phil shook his head so Dan let go of him. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Not here,&rdquo; Phil said. &ldquo;Famous YouTuber, my viewers could be anywhere and I don&rsquo;t trust them not to spread anything about AmazingPhil being caught wrapped up in a stranger&rsquo;s arms.&rdquo; Dan nodded because he did understand what Phil was saying and murmered a quick apology. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; Phil said back. He paused for a moment. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go back to your place, that way we can do whatever we want to do.&rdquo; Dan shrugged.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Yeah, I guess that works,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Just going to warn you though, I haven&rsquo;t been home in a week and my roommate isn&rsquo;t the cleanest person on the planet. Phil smiled.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;\"That&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo; Dan shrugged again and grabbed Phil&rsquo;s hand again. Phil squeezed his hand. He liked how his hand felt. As if like pieces of a puzzle that fit perfectly. None of his past boyfriends had ever felt like that when he had held their hands. He thought that this sort of feeling was just in romance novels, some standard that he shouldn&rsquo;t actually look for because it was impossible. Not like hand-holding was the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; thing to base relationships off of. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Dan ordered an uber so they could head back to his place and the app told him that the driver would be there to get them in a few minutes. He sighed and looked over to Phil. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;So what have you been doing these last few days?&rdquo; Dan asked him. Phil seemed distracted, but his attention went right to Dan as soon as the question was done.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;What?&rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;I asked you what you&rsquo;ve been up to these last few days,&rdquo; Dan said. &ldquo;Are you deaf?&rdquo; He teased. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Probably,&rdquo; Phil said. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve mostly been just working on that video.&rdquo; Phil sighed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a long time since I&rsquo;ve done one and I don&rsquo;t even know what people would want me to keep in it.&rdquo; Dan wanted to kiss him to assure him that he would do fine, but Phil had already made it pretty clear that PDA was a big no no. For now at least while they were still in the early stages and he didn&rsquo;t want to introduce Dan as his boyfriend &lt;em&gt;officially&lt;/em&gt;. If that&rsquo;s even what they were. He wasn&rsquo;t quite sure. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure people will love it no matter what,&rdquo; Dan said. &ldquo;And if they don&rsquo;t, well screw them you put your heart and soul into that video and as long as you&rsquo;re proud of it, that&rsquo;s all that matters.&rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Well this YouTube this is kind of my only source of income,&rdquo; Phil said. &ldquo;I think it very well &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; matter what the people think of it. If they hate it I don&rsquo;t make money.&rdquo; Dan rolled his eyes in reply. Their uber pulled up and let them into the car. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;I would bet you everything that I have that you can&rsquo;t do anything to make it fail bad enough that everyone hates it and you make no money,&rdquo; Dan said. Phil sighed.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right.&rdquo; He shook his head. &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re right, so why do I not believe it?&rdquo; They bucked their seatbelts and Dan gave the driver the address of his building. &nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re being dumb,&rdquo; Dan said. He noticed a stray hair on Phil&rsquo;s head and fixed it. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be that bad. You can show me what you&rsquo;ve got so far when we get back to my place,&rdquo; Dan said. Phil nodded and rested his head on Dan&rsquo;s shoulder. This wasn&rsquo;t something he was used to. Normally he was the one who put his head on his boyfriend&rsquo;s shoulder. He looked down and Phil had his eyes closed. &ldquo;Say you won&rsquo;t let go&rdquo; by James Arthur came on and the driver turned it up.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;This is my jam!&rdquo; she said and she started belting the lyrics. Dan smiled at Phil and lightly ran his hand down Phil&rsquo;s arm. He somehow couldn&rsquo;t help but feel the song was talking about him and Phil even though they hadn&rsquo;t known each other for very long. He felt a wave of joy that he hadn&rsquo;t felt in a long time. Not since he&rsquo;d proposed to his ex-fiancee and he&rsquo;d said yes. A feeling he thought that he&rsquo;d never feel again due to the nature of it. Why was it that Phil was able to make him feel so happy so easily?&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Once they reached Dan&rsquo;s building, they thanked the driver and Dan paid her for her time and the gas that she used. He grabbed Phil&rsquo;s hand and lead him upstairs to his apartment. He fumbled for the key outside of his door and opened it up. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Home sweet home,&rdquo; Dan said with a shrug. &ldquo;I know it isn&rsquo;t much but-&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Oh hush with that,&rdquo; Phil said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hear it.&rdquo; Phil looked around. Dan was right about it not being much, but he didn&rsquo;t mind at all. He knew that Dan was doing his best with the money that he had and he couldn&rsquo;t say anything bad about that. Not everyone had the privileges that he had as a YouTuber who was making a good amount of money. Besides, it was a decent place, it wasn&rsquo;t like there was rat shit everywhere. The only smell was from the kitchen and what looked like some sort of science experiment gone wrong. Dan groaned. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Sorry, my roommate thinks he&rsquo;s a chef.&rdquo; He rolled his eyes. &ldquo;A chef who can never clean up after himself. He walked over to the stove and turned it off so hopefully some of the smell would die off. \"Let&rsquo;s go to my room. It&rsquo;s in better shape than the rest of this place.&rdquo; Dan shook his head and blushed with embarrassment. He couldn&rsquo;t believe that he&rsquo;d actually let Phil see his home like this. His mother would &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; approve of his host skills. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;He shut and locked the door behind him (his roommate had an unfortunate habit of walking in his room without knocking). He realized that he really should have cleaned his room before he went to get Phil from the station. His bed wasn&rsquo;t made. His bag was still shoved in the corner, not put away at all. He had clothes (a mix of clean and dirty) strewn all over his floor from before his trip when he was desperately trying to find something to wear for the week that wasn&rsquo;t going to be &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; embarrassing. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;So where were we,&rdquo; Phil said, ignoring the mess in the room. All that mattered to him was Dan. He grabbed Dan by the belt loops, just as Dan had attempted earlier. He figured it was something Dan liked since he&rsquo;d done it. He put a kiss on the tip of Dan&rsquo;s nose. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve missed you,&rdquo; Dan said. He decided that he wanted Phil to make the first move towards the first &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; kiss of the day. Dan thought that dominance was hot. In some cases. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Why? I&rsquo;m not anything more special just because I&rsquo;m slightly famous,&rdquo; Phil replied. Dan smacked him.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;You know that&rsquo;s not why.&rdquo; Phil kissed him on the lips. Dan sighed and melted into the kiss. Phil broke the kiss and sat on the bed. &lt;br /&gt;</p><p>&ldquo;I was going to show you what I have.&rdquo; He smiled and pulled out his laptop Dan sat down beside him. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Oh right,&rdquo; Dan said, slightly disappointed that Phil hadn&rsquo;t kissed him again. He shook the feeling though because they had at &nbsp;least an entire day to themselves before Phil would go back to Manchester. There would (hopefully) be more kisses to come. Phil pulled up the video and made sure his volume was up and hit play. Dan watched and tried to judge mostly based off of what a viewer might think of it, but all he could think of was the fun they&rsquo;d had in New York. Once the video was over, Phil looked at Dan with doubt written all over his face. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; Dan said. &ldquo;Just keep what you&rsquo;re doing. It just needs finished.&rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;You really think that it&rsquo;s good?&rdquo; Dan nodded.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;I would have told you that it was shit if it was shit,&rdquo; Dan replied, though he wasn&rsquo;t sure if that was a true statement because he didn&rsquo;t really want to tell Phil anything negative about something that he&rsquo;d clearly worked hard on. Phil smiled. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s finish it together than, shall we?&rdquo; Phil asked. Dan shook his head. &lt;br /&gt;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I should put anything into it, it&rsquo;s your video. Your idea. It&rsquo;s going on your channel. You just do whatever to it, I really don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; Dan said. Phil nodded.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Ok, I guess.&rdquo; He looked around the room. &ldquo;So what would you rather do then?&rdquo; Dan&rsquo;s mind went to a dark hole that he knew wasn&rsquo;t an appropriate place to be with someone he&rsquo;s only recently met. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said instead of telling Phil what was actually going through his head. He didn&rsquo;t want Phil to think anything bad about him, even if his thoughts weren&rsquo;t exactly &nbsp;pure at the moment. Phil shrugged and decided to work on the video. It&rsquo;d been a while since his audience had gotten one from him, and if Dan thought it was good, he should probably finish it so they could have a new video. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Well when you figure it out, let me know,&rdquo; Phil said. &ldquo;I did all the planning in New York. We&rsquo;re in your turf now, it&rsquo;s your turn to pick what we do.&rdquo; Dan sighed. He honestly couldn&rsquo;t even think of anything to do in London besides eating and going on the London Eye, neither of which were very appealing at the moment. Dan snuggled into Phil and put his head on Phil&rsquo;s shoulder. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t we just hang out here?&rdquo; Phil raised an eyebrow at him but didn&rsquo;t say anything, determined to finish the video if Dan wasn&rsquo;t going to come up with an actual activity to do. He was fine with just hanging out like this anyway. Having Dan there would probably make the video take longer, but he knew it would be worth it. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;We can, I suppose,&rdquo; Phil said. He looked to Dan then back to the video and sighed. He put his laptop away, deciding that it would be better if he put all of his attention to Dan. He hadn&rsquo;t seen him him in a few days anyway. He would never get the day back, so he should probably make the most of it. &ldquo;What did you have in mind?&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Talking and sharing our deepest secrets is a fun place to start,&rdquo; Dan said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll start. I almost got married to a man and my family doesn&rsquo;t even know that I&rsquo;m gay yet.&rdquo; Phil raised his eyebrows. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;You did what now?&rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;You heard me.&rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;And your parents still don&rsquo;t know you&rsquo;re gay?&rdquo; Phil shook his head. &ldquo;Who did they think he was when you brought him around to the house?&rdquo; Dan shook his head.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;They never met him,&rdquo; Dan said. Phil stared at him like he was insane.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;And you were going to marry this dude?&rdquo; Dan shrugged.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;I suppose we broke up for a reason.&rdquo; Phil rolled his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell them? You obviously used to be crazy about this guy, why didn&rsquo;t you tell them before you got engaged to a guy.&rdquo; Dan sighed.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;I feel like my mom is going to be very disappointed in me for it. She&rsquo;s already not proud of me as it is. I mean look at me. I&rsquo;m a lawyer, but I have to have a roommate just to afford a decent apartment. I work my ass off for everything I have, and I still don&rsquo;t have much. Plus she really wants grandkids from me and well,&rdquo; Dan gestured to himself. &ldquo;I obviously can&rsquo;t give them to her myself.&rdquo; He shook his head and squeezed his eyes shut as a way to fight back the tears. Part of him knew that some of that was irrational. At the same time, it wasn&rsquo;t because some of it was very real. Phil wrapped his arms around Dan and held him tight. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure none of that is true and your parents love you very much,&rdquo; Phil replied. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Love has nothing to do with pride,&rdquo; Dan said. &ldquo;And my parents aren&rsquo;t nearly as proud of me as they are in my little brother. I can&rsquo;t throw being gay in on top of that unless I can find a boyfriend who can make them proud.&rdquo; Phil kissed Dan&rsquo;s cheek. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;If your &lt;em&gt;boyfriend&lt;/em&gt; becomes what your parents are proud of, you&rsquo;re only going to feel worse about yourself Dan,&rdquo; Phil said softly. &ldquo;But if you want them to be proud of you, you really need to be proud of &lt;em&gt;yourself &lt;/em&gt; first. Have so much pride in yourself that you don&rsquo;t need you parents&rsquo; approval, but it&rsquo;s just an added bonus.&rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Easier said than done Mr. Millionaire,&rdquo; Dan said. Phil let go of Dan to cross his arms over his chest. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right Dan, I do make a lot of money,&rdquo; Phil said. &ldquo;But that is not where I find my pride. My pride comes in that the reason I make so much is that I&rsquo;m just making fun little videos for the internet. I do everything for those videos and people appreciate them so much that I&rsquo;m able to make a living off of it.&rdquo; Phil didn&rsquo;t want to tell him just how much money he made because he didn&rsquo;t want Dan to feel worse. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve just got to find something within yourself to be proud of for yourself. Anything.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Well I graduated college,&rdquo; Dan said. Phil nodded.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Yes you did. Is that something you&rsquo;re actually proud of?&rdquo; Dan sighed.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;No, not really.&rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Then it doesn&rsquo;t count.&rdquo; Phil pulled out his laptop so he could work on his video and give Dan space to think. He knew for a fact that Dan had to have &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; in his life that he was proud of, no matter how small, and he was determined to make Dan see that and even feel just a bit of pride. Sometimes pride was a bad thing, but there was nothing wrong with just a touch of it to lead to a happier life. Dan wasn&rsquo;t able to come up with anything that he was actually proud of. He&rsquo;d proposed to a guy. Yeah, cool, but he wasn&rsquo;t the right guy he should have been getting engaged to and he never even told his parents that he&rsquo;d been dating the guy, let alone the fact that he&rsquo;d wanted to &lt;em&gt;marry &lt;/em&gt;the guy. Maybe if his family had been involved with that, he wouldn&rsquo;t have even gotten engaged in the first place and had himself set up to have his heart broken. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to come out to my family,&rdquo; Dan said. &ldquo;All at once. I am going to be out and proud of being gay and I am going to be proud of myself for finally telling them about this part of who I am,&rdquo; Dan said. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good place to start,&rdquo; Phil said. &ldquo;When are you going to do it?&rdquo; He knew that if Dan didn&rsquo;t make a plan, it wouldn&rsquo;t happen. It&rsquo;s how he himself got around to coming out. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;This weekend,&rdquo; Dan said, already texting his parents to ask them if they were free for dinner that Saturday at his place. He texted his brother next, deciding that it would be best if he just invited them all to find out at one time. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Do you want me to be here to support you?&rdquo; Phil asked. Dan shook his head.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;No, thanks for the offer though. No offence, but I&rsquo;m not ready to introduce you to the family yet.&rdquo; Phil shrugged.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;None taken. I get it. We haven&rsquo;t known each other for very long and are only in the early stages of getting to know each other in the first place.&rdquo; He meant it when he said this. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;The pair spent the rest of the day just talking about nothing important with occasional kisses and helping to plan how Dan was going to come out. This was a big step in the right direction, Phil knew. Dan was going to get his life put on a track that he actually wanted it to go down rather than one that everyone else wanted it to go down. &lt;/p&gt;</p></p>",
