There, she had significantly mellowed out\nthe scene where he tells her she wasn\u2019t going to college and just needed to\nfind a husband. I said he didn\u2019t look like the stubborn dick I remembered, but a\ndopey, oblivious dude&hellip; It\u2019s like, Stohl saw my post, decided I was making a\ngood point, and went all the way into the other direction&hellip; \u00a0This alone should tell us how much care and\nattention goes into forging these stories these day, how clear and laid out the\ndirection for each character is! Last year Joseph Danvers was just a moron with\na pot belly, now he\u2019s the King of Punchville, population: my kids.

First of all: HE\u2019S YOUNGER THAN CAROL NOT OLDER.\nHow do you fuck that up?! He\u2019s the third child, she\u2019s the second! Yet Carol\ncalls him big brother, and he\u2019s portrayed as bigger and taller than her in\nflashbacks. Look, I know Ike Perlmutter pays editors in stale bread and wedgies,\nbut come on, it took me five minutes to double check it!</p><p>Besides\nthat: Joe Jr was a complete blank slate, you could\u2019ve done literally ANYTHING\nwith him, and what happens? He gets fucking FRIDGED. Slams his car and becomes\na vegetable so Carol has an excuse to linger in her family home&hellip; it feels\nlike his head trauma is just there to have a time-skip, so that Carol\u2019s hair\ngrows to resemble Brie Larson\u2019s length, just in time for the fucking movie! Like,\nare you kidding me? How wasteful is that? I mean, with how this issue ended, it\u2019s\nentirely possible they\u2019re going to have magic alien tech or some shit to fix\nhim up, but still, I\u2019m not holding my breath.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-height=\"344\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f2c1a24552085c5e3e7bf6b07027c458/tumblr_inline_pc3xq8C4z11tvvkay_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-height=\"344\"/></figure><p>Finally,\nthere\u2019s Marie, Carol\u2019s mom. Yup, there she is. She\u2019s just there. She\u2019s always\nbeen just there. Nobody seems to know what to do with her. She was always the\nquiet, sweet housewife that wasn\u2019t quite sure how to handle her husband\nhistrionics except be patient and supporting. That character trait still\nlingers, but now that Joseph graduated in open abusiveness, her patient looks\ncriminal. At least, when they made Steve\u2019s dad abusive, it was to showcase\nSarah Rogers\u2019 strength of character, how she boldly and proudly stood up to her\nhusband\u2019s abuse&hellip; here, Marie Danvers just tells her daughter to pipe it down while\nher husband wails on her children. She\u2019s a goddamn enabler. One change, two\ncharacters ruined.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-height=\"466\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/cd5bb145d22ca9c42c86a79a5e5818ff/tumblr_inline_pc3xm0duRc1tvvkay_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-height=\"466\"/></figure><p>The fact\nthat Carol has been brain wiped not once but twice, is completely disregarded,\nwhich is absurd, because it\u2019s the biggest and most profound source of emotional\nturmoil she has! When Brian Reed wrote the story revolving around it, it was\nheartbreaking! Carol\u2019s loss of memory, having her show up at her family house,\nrealizing she doesn\u2019t know these people, that she should feel anger, and love,\nand rage, and sadness, but nothing comes up, because she has nothing left.</p><p>In TLofCM,\nthis feeling of alienation is never brought up, it\u2019s only ever barely hinted at.\nHer mindwipe isn\u2019t mentioned, just tangentially referred to, and it\u2019s treated\nlike the reason Carol never shows up to her old home is that the memories of\nher dad are too painful. Great job guys, you took Carol\u2019s very specific and\ninteresting source of pain and replaced it with daddy\u2019s issues. Plus, as I\nmentioned, IRL it\u2019s been ten years since Carol met her family. In canon at\nleast a couple must\u2019ve passed, yet this separation is barely mentioned. Her\nmother welcomes her to their summer home with the warmth you\u2019d expect if they\nmet like once a week or once a month, where she should\u2019ve gone \u201cWhere the fuck\nhave you been?!\u201d. Joe Jr is the only one that brings it up, and it still feels\nway too casual.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"900\" data-orig-height=\"556\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/edfc7d213deac8b0650a69749819a2cf/tumblr_inline_pc3xmeOrIO1tvvkay_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"900\" data-orig-height=\"556\"/></figure><p>Now, let\u2019s\nfinally speak about Carol. I really hope I won\u2019t sound like an arrogant prick,\nbut reading earlier issues of Margaret Stohl\u2019s run, I once tweeted \u201c<i>this is\nsomething I would write if I lacked any self-awareness</i>\u201d. Nothing is more true\nthan in this issue, where Carol acts like a unhinged psychopath in the most\nworrying of ways. We see her snap and downright punch her FATHER\u2019S \u00a0TOMBSTONE into pieces. I mean, I was shocked!\nWhat the fuck?! Who does this? How is she going to explain this to her mother?!\nTo her brother?! How much of a mental trainwreck do you have to be to go this\nfar? Hating your dad is one thing, desecrating a cemetery is another one entirely!\nAnd at the beginning of the issue she brutalizes Moonstone, with the Avengers\njust idly standing by the side quipping about it&hellip; GUYS THIS IS NO LAUGHING\nMATTER, Carol is suffering another breakdown. Also no laughing matter is what\nhappened to Carol\u2019s brother, but the tone this book has is way too carefree and\nlight to properly deal with it. Every single dialogue Carol has is coated with\nsome matter of snappy comeback, or clever line. It creates an ironic distance\nthat doesn\u2019t allow the drama to unfold.</p><p>Look, ok, this\nis just the very first issue, and the ending seems to imply there was something\nmore going on with Carol\u2019s dad, but that just fills me with even more dread, suddenly\nwe\u2019re bringing in more spaceshit! We\u2019ve been seeing Carol deal with trite\nspaceshit for years now, this could\u2019ve been a down to earth, emotional, quiet miniseries\nfocusing entirely on Carol\u2019s family life and childhood, but no, there\u2019s still\nconspiracies and mysterious glowing gadgets and space foetuses, and god knows\nwhat matter of absurdist retcon awaiting us.</p><p>Off on a\ngreat start.</p>",

I mean, with how this issue ended, it\u2019s\nentirely possible they\u2019re going to have magic alien tech or some shit to fix\nhim up, but still, I\u2019m not holding my breath.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-height=\"344\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f2c1a24552085c5e3e7bf6b07027c458/tumblr_inline_pc3xq8C4z11tvvkay_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-height=\"344\"></figure><p>Finally,\nthere\u2019s Marie, Carol\u2019s mom.

She was always the\nquiet, sweet housewife that wasn\u2019t quite sure how to handle her husband\nhistrionics except be patient and supporting. That character trait still\nlingers, but now that Joseph graduated in open abusiveness, her patient looks\ncriminal. At least, when they made Steve\u2019s dad abusive, it was to showcase\nSarah Rogers\u2019 strength of character, how she boldly and proudly stood up to her\nhusband\u2019s abuse\u2026 here, Marie Danvers just tells her daughter to pipe it down while\nher husband wails on her children. She\u2019s a goddamn enabler.

When Brian Reed wrote the story revolving around it, it was\nheartbreaking! Carol\u2019s loss of memory, having her show up at her family house,\nrealizing she doesn\u2019t know these people, that she should feel anger, and love,\nand rage, and sadness, but nothing comes up, because she has nothing left.</p><p>In TLofCM,\nthis feeling of alienation is never brought up, it\u2019s only ever barely hinted at.\nHer mindwipe isn\u2019t mentioned, just tangentially referred to, and it\u2019s treated\nlike the reason Carol never shows up to her old home is that the memories of\nher dad are too painful. Great job guys, you took Carol\u2019s very specific and\ninteresting source of pain and replaced it with daddy\u2019s issues. Plus, as I\nmentioned, IRL it\u2019s been ten years since Carol met her family. In canon at\nleast a couple must\u2019ve passed, yet this separation is barely mentioned. Her\nmother welcomes her to their summer home with the warmth you\u2019d expect if they\nmet like once a week or once a month, where she should\u2019ve gone \u201cWhere the fuck\nhave you been?!\u201d.

Nothing is more true\nthan in this issue, where Carol acts like a unhinged psychopath in the most\nworrying of ways. We see her snap and downright punch her FATHER\u2019S \u00a0TOMBSTONE into pieces. I mean, I was shocked!\nWhat the fuck?! Who does this? How is she going to explain this to her mother?!\nTo her brother?! How much of a mental trainwreck do you have to be to go this\nfar? Hating your dad is one thing, desecrating a cemetery is another one entirely!\nAnd at the beginning of the issue she brutalizes Moonstone, with the Avengers\njust idly standing by the side quipping about it\u2026 GUYS THIS IS NO LAUGHING\nMATTER, Carol is suffering another breakdown. Also no laughing matter is what\nhappened to Carol\u2019s brother, but the tone this book has is way too carefree and\nlight to properly deal with it. Every single dialogue Carol has is coated with\nsome matter of snappy comeback, or clever line. It creates an ironic distance\nthat doesn\u2019t allow the drama to unfold.</p><p>Look, ok, this\nis just the very first issue, and the ending seems to imply there was something\nmore going on with Carol\u2019s dad, but that just fills me with even more dread, suddenly\nwe\u2019re bringing in more spaceshit! We\u2019ve been seeing Carol deal with trite\nspaceshit for years now, this could\u2019ve been a down to earth, emotional, quiet miniseries\nfocusing entirely on Carol\u2019s family life and childhood, but no, there\u2019s still\nconspiracies and mysterious glowing gadgets and space foetuses, and god knows\nwhat matter of absurdist retcon awaiting us.</p><p>Off on a\ngreat start.</p>",

Look, I know Ike Perlmutter pays editors in stale bread and wedgies,\nbut come on, it took me five minutes to double check it!</p><p>Besides\nthat: Joe Jr was a complete blank slate, you could&rsquo;ve done literally ANYTHING\nwith him, and what happens? He gets fucking FRIDGED. Slams his car and becomes\na vegetable so Carol has an excuse to linger in her family home&hellip; it feels\nlike his head trauma is just there to have a time-skip, so that Carol&rsquo;s hair\ngrows to resemble Brie Larson&rsquo;s length, just in time for the fucking movie! Like,\nare you kidding me? How wasteful is that? I mean, with how this issue ended, it&rsquo;s\nentirely possible they&rsquo;re going to have magic alien tech or some shit to fix\nhim up, but still, I&rsquo;m not holding my breath.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f2c1a24552085c5e3e7bf6b07027c458/tumblr_inline_pc3xq8C4z11tvvkay_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Finally,\nthere&rsquo;s Marie, Carol&rsquo;s mom. Yup, there she is. She&rsquo;s just there. She&rsquo;s always\nbeen just there. Nobody seems to know what to do with her. She was always the\nquiet, sweet housewife that wasn&rsquo;t quite sure how to handle her husband\nhistrionics except be patient and supporting. That character trait still\nlingers, but now that Joseph graduated in open abusiveness, her patient looks\ncriminal. At least, when they made Steve&rsquo;s dad abusive, it was to showcase\nSarah Rogers&rsquo; strength of character, how she boldly and proudly stood up to her\nhusband&rsquo;s abuse&hellip; here, Marie Danvers just tells her daughter to pipe it down while\nher husband wails on her children. She&rsquo;s a goddamn enabler. One change, two\ncharacters ruined.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/cd5bb145d22ca9c42c86a79a5e5818ff/tumblr_inline_pc3xm0duRc1tvvkay_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>The fact\nthat Carol has been brain wiped not once but twice, is completely disregarded,\nwhich is absurd, because it&rsquo;s the biggest and most profound source of emotional\nturmoil she has! When Brian Reed wrote the story revolving around it, it was\nheartbreaking! Carol&rsquo;s loss of memory, having her show up at her family house,\nrealizing she doesn&rsquo;t know these people, that she should feel anger, and love,\nand rage, and sadness, but nothing comes up, because she has nothing left.</p><p>In TLofCM,\nthis feeling of alienation is never brought up, it&rsquo;s only ever barely hinted at.\nHer mindwipe isn&rsquo;t mentioned, just tangentially referred to, and it&rsquo;s treated\nlike the reason Carol never shows up to her old home is that the memories of\nher dad are too painful. Great job guys, you took Carol&rsquo;s very specific and\ninteresting source of pain and replaced it with daddy&rsquo;s issues. Plus, as I\nmentioned, IRL it&rsquo;s been ten years since Carol met her family. In canon at\nleast a couple must&rsquo;ve passed, yet this separation is barely mentioned. Her\nmother welcomes her to their summer home with the warmth you&rsquo;d expect if they\nmet like once a week or once a month, where she should&rsquo;ve gone &ldquo;Where the fuck\nhave you been?!&rdquo;. Joe Jr is the only one that brings it up, and it still feels\nway too casual.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/edfc7d213deac8b0650a69749819a2cf/tumblr_inline_pc3xmeOrIO1tvvkay_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Now, let&rsquo;s\nfinally speak about Carol. I really hope I won&rsquo;t sound like an arrogant prick,\nbut reading earlier issues of Margaret Stohl&rsquo;s run, I once tweeted &ldquo;<i>this is\nsomething I would write if I lacked any self-awareness</i>&rdquo;. Nothing is more true\nthan in this issue, where Carol acts like a unhinged psychopath in the most\nworrying of ways. We see her snap and downright punch her FATHER&rsquo;S &nbsp;TOMBSTONE into pieces. I mean, I was shocked!\nWhat the fuck?! Who does this? How is she going to explain this to her mother?!\nTo her brother?! How much of a mental trainwreck do you have to be to go this\nfar? Hating your dad is one thing, desecrating a cemetery is another one entirely!\nAnd at the beginning of the issue she brutalizes Moonstone, with the Avengers\njust idly standing by the side quipping about it&hellip; GUYS THIS IS NO LAUGHING\nMATTER, Carol is suffering another breakdown. Also no laughing matter is what\nhappened to Carol&rsquo;s brother, but the tone this book has is way too carefree and\nlight to properly deal with it. Every single dialogue Carol has is coated with\nsome matter of snappy comeback, or clever line. It creates an ironic distance\nthat doesn&rsquo;t allow the drama to unfold.</p><p>Look, ok, this\nis just the very first issue, and the ending seems to imply there was something\nmore going on with Carol&rsquo;s dad, but that just fills me with even more dread, suddenly\nwe&rsquo;re bringing in more spaceshit! We&rsquo;ve been seeing Carol deal with trite\nspaceshit for years now, this could&rsquo;ve been a down to earth, emotional, quiet miniseries\nfocusing entirely on Carol&rsquo;s family life and childhood, but no, there&rsquo;s still\nconspiracies and mysterious glowing gadgets and space foetuses, and god knows\nwhat matter of absurdist retcon awaiting us.</p><p>Off on a\ngreat start.</p>",
