Disabled people know when able bodied people are looking at us like we&rsquo;re disgusting! We recognize those looks, because we&rsquo;ve had to deal with them our whole lives.</p><p>Sansa is a lot nicer to Tyrion than most people are, but Tyrion still recognizes <i>that look</i>, the look he talked about in AGOT:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n\n\n\u201cBe certain that you tell her who I am, and warn her of<i> what </i>I am.&ldquo; Jyck had not always troubled to do that. There was a look the girls got in their eyes sometimes when they first beheld the lordling they&rsquo;d been hired to pleasure \u2026 a look that Tyrion Lannister did not ever care to see again.\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>Disabled people learn pretty early in their lives what that look is like and how to watch out for it and guard yourself against it. And Tyrion is also an abuse victim who has had to learn how to recognize when people view him as lesser because of his disability because being viewed as lesser means you can be abused. A lot of the parts of Tyrion\u2019s personality are coping mechanisms for this: he\u2019s always the first person in the room to make an ableist joke so that other people can\u2019t hurt him with it, he shoves his difference in other people\u2019s faces.</p><p>We don\u2019t get Tyrion\u2019s POV on their wedding night but we do get Sansa\u2019s thoughts.

It\u2019s not right and it\u2019s not fair, but it is those things because she\u2019s a child and a hostage who is being abused, not because of Tyrion\u2019s appearance or because he\u2019s not tall enough to cloak her. The cloaking is also a way that ableism is ingrained in the very culture, reinforcing patriarchal norms. This also helps oppress women because it distracts Sansa from the real unfairness of the situation. If only her husband was big and strong, then everything would be okay. Tyrion has some of the same thoughts. If only he were big and strong, maybe Sansa would love him.

But ableism is certainly a part of it, and I think that the societal ableism that Sansa has picked up has only increased her fear and terror of Tyrion, which in turn makes her more repulsed by his disabled body because she\u2019s already repulsed by the situation as a whole. Her ableism is&hellip;not really her fault, but it\u2019s still there, and for Tyrion it is no less painful or real.
