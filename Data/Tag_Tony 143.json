        "body": "<p>AU by the amazing <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGrkwAkBKPUhKXVW4V7mU4w\">@reniisbooks</a> uwu</p><p>Enjoy</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>The rest of the day was hell for Peter- like any other day for that matter. He got to college, almost fell asleep during a lecture and got slapped with maybe ten assignments due next month, then he tiredly took the subway to a small Cafe where he worked - to be able to pay rent and stuff, since he was on a scholarship- then finally,<i> finally</i> got home and collapsed on his couch. It was around 5:48 pm when Peter woke up from a much needed nap. He heard a knock on his apartment door and raised a brow. No one ever came over to visit him, he didn&rsquo;t have any good friends to come over whenever they wanted and his Aunt was all the way in Europe for work-</p><p><i>Shit</i>. The date. Tony. He totally forgot! Damn it Parker you don&rsquo;t forget about your date with <b>Tony <i>fucking</i> Stark</b>! He immediately checked his phone. No messages, no calls&ndash;barely 5:50</p><p>&hellip; But the date was at eight&hellip;? He let out a breath of relief, it couldn&rsquo;t be him. He lazily got out of bed and walked to the door confused as hell. The knocking had stopped a while ago but he still unlocked and opened the door to see absolutely no-one standing on the hallway. It was probably a prank, he guessed, before looking down to see a beautiful white box tied with a black, silk ribbon. On top of it, there was a red rose and a small envelop. Peter was hesitant, looking around for a bit to see if the address was mistaken and someone would come back for the package, but after a few minuets he picked it up, carefully, because<i> god damn</i> it looked so expensive. That box alone was probably worth more than his entire apartment. He took it inside and placed it on the small desk next to his couch, taking a look at the envelope at first. There was nothing written on it. He shrugged and opened it carefully, so in case it wasn&rsquo;t actually for him he could seal it back. After opening it as slow as possible he pulled out a hand written note </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Hope it fits</i>&rdquo;</p><p>Peter raised a brow. This was so weird and confusing his head hurt. Maybe he was still asleep? He slid the note back inside the envelope and left it aside, on his desk, then took the rose and placed in a water vase. </p><p>He finally got to the box and pulled the ribbon, untying the pretty bow on top and opened it, scared and anxious. There could&rsquo;ve been a bomb inside<i>, just saying.</i></p><p>Instead, he saw fabric. Beautiful, dark blue fabric that smelled new and luxurious. He gently pulled it out and damn it- it was a three piece suit, in what seemed to be his size, next to delicately folded white button up. This was Tony&rsquo;s doing. Clearly. He rolled his eyes but couldn&rsquo;t help smiling and blushing. He didn&rsquo;t expect this when Tony said &rsquo;<i>I&rsquo;ll handle the rest</i>&rsquo; but he was happy he did. Of course, he felt so overwhelmed and a bit guilty for making the other spend money on him, but he was gonna pay him back. Eventually.</p><p>At around 6:32 Peter started getting ready. He took a hot shower, washed his hair with some strawberry scented shampoo <i>(cuz it was on sale and he&rsquo;s a broke college student)</i>, shaved and put on some perfume <i>(The cheap kind cuz he can\u2019t afford anything else. Tony&rsquo;s gonna change that tho don&rsquo;t worry)</i></p><p>He eventually put on the suit and it fit like a glove- Peter felt <i>gorgeous</i>. His confidence went through the roof for a moment before realizing the suit was probably more expansive than his entire existence. <i>Cue panic attack</i>.</p><p>Before he could worry too much though he heard another knock on the door and checked the time again - 7:58. Okay so maybe it was Tony this time. He rushed to the door and opened it eagerly with the brightest smile on his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey kid&rdquo; the man was standing there, in all his fancy glory, with a hand in his pocket and holding a bouquet of red roses with the other. He wore a suit similar to Peter&rsquo;s, but in black, with a red tie and damn he looked hot. </p><p>\u201cH-hey Mrs Stark! It\u2019s nice to see you outside a subway for once&hellip;\u201d he chuckled \u00a0\u201cAnd thanks for the suit by the way\u201d </p><p>\u201cHm&hellip;You look even prettier than i could ever imagine\u201d Tony smirked pulling his hand out of his pocket, placing it on the boy\u2019s waist and stepping closer to him.</p><p>\u201cI give myself credit for making this investment\u201d </p><p>\u201cJ-Jesus Tony!\u201d The boy blushed darkly, covering his face </p><p>\u201cWhat? Something wrong?\u201d he teased, leaning in closer until they were pressed against each other like earlier that day, in the subway. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a precious little thing, you know? here&hellip; these are for you\u201d he smiled sweetly, kissing his forehead and giving him the flowers </p><p>\u201cWoah they\u2019re&hellip;holy shit they\u2019re so pretty &hellip;\u201d the boy grabbed the bouquet and buried his nose in the petals, taking in the sweet, flowery scent. \u00a0\u201cWhen I was little and lived with my aunt in the country side she had a gorgeous garden of roses &hellip; Whenever I see them I get nostalgic but God they\u2019re so pretty &hellip;.\u201d Peter whispered and looked up at his date \u201cI\u2019ll put them in some water and be right back, okay? You can come inside to wait if you want\u201d </p><p>Tony nodded, following the boy in the small apartment and looking around for a moment. There was a small, open kitchen connected to a tiny living room. There was a couch covered in blankets and an old TV that probably didn\u2019t even work. There was a closet on the left side of the couch and a desk, with the opened white box , on the right side. The kitchen was also pretty empty but clean. Then there was a door, probably leading to the bathroom. As Peter filled a vase with water Tony couldn\u2019t help but ask</p><p>\u201cHey kid? Where\u2019s your bedroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm? Oh, I don\u2019t have one. I sleep on the couch. I can\u2019t afford an apartment with a bedroom.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s heart <i><b>shattered</b></i>. He had to convince the boy to become his sugar baby so he could get him a better place than this- </p><p>\u201cAlright ! All done. Shall we?\u201d peter smiled setting the vase on his desk, next to the other rose </p><p>\u201cYeah, don\u2019t wanna be late for our reservation\u201d</p><p><i><b>\u201cFoR oUr WhAt?!\u201d</b></i></p><p>As it turned out to be, Tony took Peter to one of the most expensive restaurants in the world. They were led by a really sweet waitress to a table on a huge balcony, where no one else was seated, and served with the best champagne Peter had ever tasted. One small glance to his left and he could see the entire city from up there. Tony, on the other hand, only stared at the boy and laughed at his amazed gaze, his wide, honey brown eyes and parted, pink lips. He couldn\u2019t possibly take his eyes off him. </p><p>\u201cTony- this is too much . I- I can\u2019t thank you enough it\u2019s just&hellip;.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to thank me\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on now! This is- woah&hellip;I mean, do you do this with anyone cute you see on the subway? A-And what was a man like you doing on the subway it the first place!\u201d</p><p>Tony chuckled \u201cNo, not everyone&hellip; Just you. And I was on the subway because I woke up in a bar and lost my phone. So i couldn\u2019t call for a taxi. You think I\u2019d figure something else out but i was hangover. That\u2019s why I was so rude on the subway-\u201c</p><p>\u201cAlright, I can understand that, and if you didn\u2019t realize it when I accepted to go out to you- I\u2019ve forgiven you. But what about every other day?\u201d</p><p>\u201dOh i just hoped to see you again. What can i say, you were very cute. Clumsy, but cute\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes widened before he let out a chuckle, his cheeks were flushed and warm</p><p>\u201cYou did so much for me you dork- Oh god-\u201c He giggled, and Tony could only describe it as the most angelic sound he had ever heard. </p><p>About one hour later, after finishing their delicious 500 $ dinner, they couldn\u2019t help but get lost in conversation and each other\u2019s eyes. The moon was shining bright on the clear, night sky, the balcony was illuminated by fairy lights and candles, and there was soothing, mostly classical music playing from somewhere in the background. Everything was perfect, Tony wouldn\u2019t have changed a thing. </p><p>At some point, the man stood up and held out his hand for Peter, who, with a raised brow and amused smile grabbed it and pulled himself out of the chair. Intertwining his fingers with the boy\u2019s soft, delicate ones, Tony walked to the edge of the balcony, leaning his back against the glass railing with the boy pressed so close against his chest. All he had to say was \u201cCome here&hellip; Let me hold you for a bit\u201d and the boy was melting in his strong arms. \u00a0He held a hand on the boy\u2019s waist, and ran the other through his soft, brown curls. \u00a0Peter blushed , leaning into the touch and shyly wrapping his arms around Tony\u2019s neck, eventually resting his head on his shoulder. </p><p>\u201cThis is nice&hellip;\u201d He whispered, turning his head to look up at the taller male, accidentally brushing his lips over his neck. He felt Tony tense for a mere moment, and a hand tightening around his waist. \u201cYeah&hellip;it is\u201d</p><p>The boy pulled away, taking a step back and smiled up at the other. Tony looked down in admiration, like Peter was an angel sent from the heavens to sweeten the man\u2019s bitter life. </p><p>\u201cMay I&hellip;?\u201d He asked, tracing Peter\u2019s bottom lip with his thumb and slowly leaning in</p><p>\u201cPlease&hellip;\u201d the boy whispered, before closing his eyes and letting himself be pulled into a kiss. A soft, sweet kiss. A kiss that made butterflies appear in his belly. A kiss that filled his heart with pure joy. A kiss worth twenty years of waiting for. </p><p>Tony\u2019s lips were fitting perfectly against Peter\u2019s&hellip; They tasted like champagne and cigarettes&hellip; and Peter liked that. He liked that a lot. He wasn\u2019t a fan of alcohol or smoking but he loved the taste- It was intoxicating and addicting. </p><p>Peter\u2019s lips were so soft and he was so inexperienced, it made Tony want him even more. It was adorable, and precious. </p><p>A few moments later they pulled away, the need of air replacing their need of each other and the boy bit his lip, breathing heavily</p><p>\u201cI &hellip;. never thought my &hellip;first kiss would turn out like this&hellip;\u201d the boy chuckled and buried his head in the crock of Tony\u2019s neck</p><p>\u201cAnd what exactly do you mean by that sweetheart?\u201d The man smirked, hugging him tightly </p><p>\u201cI mean i never thought it would be this perfect Tony&hellip;You know, the man I\u2019ve admired since I was a kid just kissed me&hellip; It doesn\u2019t get much better than that\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point\u201d Tony smirked, sealing their lips together with another kiss.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjeGPOX9bm9SF3Mjqnp0STA\">@skyel0ve</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMLpG0l3ZXy1OB92i3viCwg\">@harmonystarker</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mngtrTNuX3ZbPbxQDQkeD8g\">@starkerthanreality</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mv1JrPSAjW44Bvur6BY7pjA\">@doctorpines</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlloZpBf2y5RjJcVea8zHcQ\">@stereksoulmates</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_S4CrymXNXhs4Xf0QKuUqg\">@park-chimies-blog</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxiqeY8f6MbKHnh1q2n63Sw\">@peterparkersapunkassbitch</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mer-OIen7zEkl4vbZu_iInw\">@explicitstark</a></p><p><i><b>\n\nI hope that\u2019s everyone who has commented on part one or rerblogged\u00a0it!

He got to college, almost fell asleep during a lecture and got slapped with maybe ten assignments due next month, then he tiredly took the subway to a small Cafe where he worked - to be able to pay rent and stuff, since he was on a scholarship- then finally,<i> finally</i> got home and collapsed on his couch. It was around 5:48 pm when Peter woke up from a much needed nap. He heard a knock on his apartment door and raised a brow. No one ever came over to visit him, he didn\u2019t have any good friends to come over whenever they wanted and his Aunt was all the way in Europe for work-</p><p><i>Shit</i>. The date. Tony. He totally forgot! Damn it Parker you don\u2019t forget about your date with <b>Tony <i>fucking</i> Stark</b>! He immediately checked his phone. No messages, no calls\u2013barely 5:50</p><p>\u2026 But the date was at eight\u2026? He let out a breath of relief, it couldn\u2019t be him. He lazily got out of bed and walked to the door confused as hell. The knocking had stopped a while ago but he still unlocked and opened the door to see absolutely no-one standing on the hallway. It was probably a prank, he guessed, before looking down to see a beautiful white box tied with a black, silk ribbon. On top of it, there was a red rose and a small envelop. Peter was hesitant, looking around for a bit to see if the address was mistaken and someone would come back for the package, but after a few minuets he picked it up, carefully, because<i> god damn</i> it looked so expensive. That box alone was probably worth more than his entire apartment. He took it inside and placed it on the small desk next to his couch, taking a look at the envelope at first. There was nothing written on it. He shrugged and opened it carefully, so in case it wasn\u2019t actually for him he could seal it back. After opening it as slow as possible he pulled out a hand written note </p><p>\u201c<i>Hope it fits</i>\u201d</p><p>Peter raised a brow. This was so weird and confusing his head hurt. Maybe he was still asleep? He slid the note back inside the envelope and left it aside, on his desk, then took the rose and placed in a water vase. </p><p>He finally got to the box and pulled the ribbon, untying the pretty bow on top and opened it, scared and anxious. There could\u2019ve been a bomb inside<i>, just saying.</i></p><p>Instead, he saw fabric. Beautiful, dark blue fabric that smelled new and luxurious. He gently pulled it out and damn it- it was a three piece suit, in what seemed to be his size, next to delicately folded white button up. This was Tony\u2019s doing. Clearly. He rolled his eyes but couldn\u2019t help smiling and blushing. He didn\u2019t expect this when Tony said \u2019<i>I\u2019ll handle the rest</i>\u2019 but he was happy he did. Of course, he felt so overwhelmed and a bit guilty for making the other spend money on him, but he was gonna pay him back. Eventually.</p><p>At around 6:32 Peter started getting ready. He took a hot shower, washed his hair with some strawberry scented shampoo <i>(cuz it was on sale and he\u2019s a broke college student)</i>, shaved and put on some perfume <i>(The cheap kind cuz he can\u2019t afford anything else. Tony\u2019s gonna change that tho don\u2019t worry)</i></p><p>He eventually put on the suit and it fit like a glove- Peter felt <i>gorgeous</i>. His confidence went through the roof for a moment before realizing the suit was probably more expansive than his entire existence. <i>Cue panic attack</i>.</p><p>Before he could worry too much though he heard another knock on the door and checked the time again - 7:58. Okay so maybe it was Tony this time. He rushed to the door and opened it eagerly with the brightest smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cHey kid\u201d the man was standing there, in all his fancy glory, with a hand in his pocket and holding a bouquet of red roses with the other. He wore a suit similar to Peter\u2019s, but in black, with a red tie and damn he looked hot. </p><p>\u201cH-hey Mrs Stark! It\u2019s nice to see you outside a subway for once\u2026\u201d he chuckled \u00a0\u201cAnd thanks for the suit by the way\u201d </p><p>\u201cHm\u2026You look even prettier than i could ever imagine\u201d Tony smirked pulling his hand out of his pocket, placing it on the boy\u2019s waist and stepping closer to him.</p><p>\u201cI give myself credit for making this investment\u201d </p><p>\u201cJ-Jesus Tony!\u201d The boy blushed darkly, covering his face </p><p>\u201cWhat? Something wrong?\u201d he teased, leaning in closer until they were pressed against each other like earlier that day, in the subway. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a precious little thing, you know? here\u2026 these are for you\u201d he smiled sweetly, kissing his forehead and giving him the flowers </p><p>\u201cWoah they\u2019re\u2026holy shit they\u2019re so pretty \u2026\u201d the boy grabbed the bouquet and buried his nose in the petals, taking in the sweet, flowery scent. \u00a0\u201cWhen I was little and lived with my aunt in the country side she had a gorgeous garden of roses \u2026 Whenever I see them I get nostalgic but God they\u2019re so pretty \u2026.\u201d Peter whispered and looked up at his date \u201cI\u2019ll put them in some water and be right back, okay? You can come inside to wait if you want\u201d </p><p>Tony nodded, following the boy in the small apartment and looking around for a moment. There was a small, open kitchen connected to a tiny living room. There was a couch covered in blankets and an old TV that probably didn\u2019t even work. There was a closet on the left side of the couch and a desk, with the opened white box , on the right side. The kitchen was also pretty empty but clean. Then there was a door, probably leading to the bathroom. As Peter filled a vase with water Tony couldn\u2019t help but ask</p><p>\u201cHey kid? Where\u2019s your bedroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm? Oh, I don\u2019t have one. I sleep on the couch. I can\u2019t afford an apartment with a bedroom.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s heart <i><b>shattered</b></i>. He had to convince the boy to become his sugar baby so he could get him a better place than this- </p><p>\u201cAlright ! All done. Shall we?\u201d peter smiled setting the vase on his desk, next to the other rose </p><p>\u201cYeah, don\u2019t wanna be late for our reservation\u201d</p><p><i><b>\u201cFoR oUr WhAt?!\u201d</b></i></p><p>As it turned out to be, Tony took Peter to one of the most expensive restaurants in the world. They were led by a really sweet waitress to a table on a huge balcony, where no one else was seated, and served with the best champagne Peter had ever tasted. One small glance to his left and he could see the entire city from up there. Tony, on the other hand, only stared at the boy and laughed at his amazed gaze, his wide, honey brown eyes and parted, pink lips. He couldn\u2019t possibly take his eyes off him. </p><p>\u201cTony- this is too much . I- I can\u2019t thank you enough it\u2019s just\u2026.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to thank me\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on now! This is- woah\u2026I mean, do you do this with anyone cute you see on the subway? A-And what was a man like you doing on the subway it the first place!\u201d</p><p>Tony chuckled \u201cNo, not everyone\u2026 Just you. And I was on the subway because I woke up in a bar and lost my phone. So i couldn\u2019t call for a taxi. You think I\u2019d figure something else out but i was hangover. That\u2019s why I was so rude on the subway-\u201c</p><p>\u201cAlright, I can understand that, and if you didn\u2019t realize it when I accepted to go out to you- I\u2019ve forgiven you.

It\u2019s nice to see you outside a subway for once\u2026\u201d he chuckled \u00a0\u201cAnd thanks for the suit by the way\u201d </p><p>\u201cHm\u2026You look even prettier than i could ever imagine\u201d Tony smirked pulling his hand out of his pocket, placing it on the boy\u2019s waist and stepping closer to him.</p><p>\u201cI give myself credit for making this investment\u201d </p><p>\u201cJ-Jesus Tony!\u201d The boy blushed darkly, covering his face </p><p>\u201cWhat? Something wrong?\u201d he teased, leaning in closer until they were pressed against each other like earlier that day, in the subway. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a precious little thing, you know? here\u2026 these are for you\u201d he smiled sweetly, kissing his forehead and giving him the flowers </p><p>\u201cWoah they\u2019re\u2026holy shit they\u2019re so pretty \u2026\u201d the boy grabbed the bouquet and buried his nose in the petals, taking in the sweet, flowery scent. \u00a0\u201cWhen I was little and lived with my aunt in the country side she had a gorgeous garden of roses \u2026 Whenever I see them I get nostalgic but God they\u2019re so pretty \u2026.\u201d Peter whispered and looked up at his date \u201cI\u2019ll put them in some water and be right back, okay? You can come inside to wait if you want\u201d </p><p>Tony nodded, following the boy in the small apartment and looking around for a moment. There was a small, open kitchen connected to a tiny living room. There was a couch covered in blankets and an old TV that probably didn\u2019t even work. There was a closet on the left side of the couch and a desk, with the opened white box , on the right side. The kitchen was also pretty empty but clean. Then there was a door, probably leading to the bathroom. As Peter filled a vase with water Tony couldn\u2019t help but ask</p><p>\u201cHey kid? Where\u2019s your bedroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm? Oh, I don\u2019t have one. I sleep on the couch. I can\u2019t afford an apartment with a bedroom.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s heart <i><b>shattered</b></i>. He had to convince the boy to become his sugar baby so he could get him a better place than this- </p><p>\u201cAlright ! All done. Shall we?\u201d peter smiled setting the vase on his desk, next to the other rose </p><p>\u201cYeah, don\u2019t wanna be late for our reservation\u201d</p><p><i><b>\u201cFoR oUr WhAt?!\u201d</b></i></p><p>As it turned out to be, Tony took Peter to one of the most expensive restaurants in the world. They were led by a really sweet waitress to a table on a huge balcony, where no one else was seated, and served with the best champagne Peter had ever tasted. One small glance to his left and he could see the entire city from up there. Tony, on the other hand, only stared at the boy and laughed at his amazed gaze, his wide, honey brown eyes and parted, pink lips. He couldn\u2019t possibly take his eyes off him. </p><p>\u201cTony- this is too much . I- I can\u2019t thank you enough it\u2019s just\u2026.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to thank me\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on now! This is- woah\u2026I mean, do you do this with anyone cute you see on the subway? A-And what was a man like you doing on the subway it the first place!\u201d</p><p>Tony chuckled \u201cNo, not everyone\u2026 Just you. And I was on the subway because I woke up in a bar and lost my phone. So i couldn\u2019t call for a taxi. You think I\u2019d figure something else out but i was hangover. That\u2019s why I was so rude on the subway-\u201c</p><p>\u201cAlright, I can understand that, and if you didn\u2019t realize it when I accepted to go out to you- I\u2019ve forgiven you. But what about every other day?\u201d</p><p>\u201dOh i just hoped to see you again. What can i say, you were very cute. Clumsy, but cute\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes widened before he let out a chuckle, his cheeks were flushed and warm</p><p>\u201cYou did so much for me you dork- Oh god-\u201c He giggled, and Tony could only describe it as the most angelic sound he had ever heard. </p><p>About one hour later, after finishing their delicious 500 $ dinner, they couldn\u2019t help but get lost in conversation and each other\u2019s eyes. The moon was shining bright on the clear, night sky, the balcony was illuminated by fairy lights and candles, and there was soothing, mostly classical music playing from somewhere in the background. Everything was perfect, Tony wouldn\u2019t have changed a thing. </p><p>At some point, the man stood up and held out his hand for Peter, who, with a raised brow and amused smile grabbed it and pulled himself out of the chair. Intertwining his fingers with the boy\u2019s soft, delicate ones, Tony walked to the edge of the balcony, leaning his back against the glass railing with the boy pressed so close against his chest. All he had to say was \u201cCome here\u2026 Let me hold you for a bit\u201d and the boy was melting in his strong arms. \u00a0He held a hand on the boy\u2019s waist, and ran the other through his soft, brown curls. \u00a0Peter blushed , leaning into the touch and shyly wrapping his arms around Tony\u2019s neck, eventually resting his head on his shoulder. </p><p>\u201cThis is nice\u2026\u201d He whispered, turning his head to look up at the taller male, accidentally brushing his lips over his neck. He felt Tony tense for a mere moment, and a hand tightening around his waist. \u201cYeah\u2026it is\u201d</p><p>The boy pulled away, taking a step back and smiled up at the other. Tony looked down in admiration, like Peter was an angel sent from the heavens to sweeten the man\u2019s bitter life. </p><p>\u201cMay I\u2026?\u201d He asked, tracing Peter\u2019s bottom lip with his thumb and slowly leaning in</p><p>\u201cPlease\u2026\u201d the boy whispered, before closing his eyes and letting himself be pulled into a kiss. A soft, sweet kiss. A kiss that made butterflies appear in his belly. A kiss that filled his heart with pure joy. A kiss worth twenty years of waiting for. </p><p>Tony\u2019s lips were fitting perfectly against Peter\u2019s\u2026 They tasted like champagne and cigarettes\u2026 and Peter liked that. He liked that a lot. He wasn\u2019t a fan of alcohol or smoking but he loved the taste- It was intoxicating and addicting. </p><p>Peter\u2019s lips were so soft and he was so inexperienced, it made Tony want him even more. It was adorable, and precious. </p><p>A few moments later they pulled away, the need of air replacing their need of each other and the boy bit his lip, breathing heavily</p><p>\u201cI \u2026. never thought my \u2026first kiss would turn out like this\u2026\u201d the boy chuckled and buried his head in the crock of Tony\u2019s neck</p><p>\u201cAnd what exactly do you mean by that sweetheart?\u201d The man smirked, hugging him tightly </p><p>\u201cI mean i never thought it would be this perfect Tony\u2026You know, the man I\u2019ve admired since I was a kid just kissed me\u2026 It doesn\u2019t get much better than that\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point\u201d Tony smirked, sealing their lips together with another kiss.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjeGPOX9bm9SF3Mjqnp0STA\">@skyel0ve</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMLpG0l3ZXy1OB92i3viCwg\">@harmonystarker</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mngtrTNuX3ZbPbxQDQkeD8g\">@starkerthanreality</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mv1JrPSAjW44Bvur6BY7pjA\">@doctorpines</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlloZpBf2y5RjJcVea8zHcQ\">@stereksoulmates</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_S4CrymXNXhs4Xf0QKuUqg\">@park-chimies-blog</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxiqeY8f6MbKHnh1q2n63Sw\">@peterparkersapunkassbitch</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mer-OIen7zEkl4vbZu_iInw\">@explicitstark</a></p><p><i><b>\n\nI hope that\u2019s everyone who has commented on part one or rerblogged\u00a0it!

He got to college, almost fell asleep during a lecture and got slapped with maybe ten assignments due next month, then he tiredly took the subway to a small Cafe where he worked - to be able to pay rent and stuff, since he was on a scholarship- then finally,<i> finally</i> got home and collapsed on his couch. It was around 5:48 pm when Peter woke up from a much needed nap. He heard a knock on his apartment door and raised a brow. No one ever came over to visit him, he didn&rsquo;t have any good friends to come over whenever they wanted and his Aunt was all the way in Europe for work-</p><p><i>Shit</i>. The date. Tony. He totally forgot! Damn it Parker you don&rsquo;t forget about your date with <b>Tony <i>fucking</i> Stark</b>! He immediately checked his phone. No messages, no calls&ndash;barely 5:50</p><p>&hellip; But the date was at eight&hellip;? He let out a breath of relief, it couldn&rsquo;t be him. He lazily got out of bed and walked to the door confused as hell. The knocking had stopped a while ago but he still unlocked and opened the door to see absolutely no-one standing on the hallway. It was probably a prank, he guessed, before looking down to see a beautiful white box tied with a black, silk ribbon. On top of it, there was a red rose and a small envelop. Peter was hesitant, looking around for a bit to see if the address was mistaken and someone would come back for the package, but after a few minuets he picked it up, carefully, because<i> god damn</i> it looked so expensive. That box alone was probably worth more than his entire apartment. He took it inside and placed it on the small desk next to his couch, taking a look at the envelope at first. There was nothing written on it. He shrugged and opened it carefully, so in case it wasn&rsquo;t actually for him he could seal it back. After opening it as slow as possible he pulled out a hand written note </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Hope it fits</i>&rdquo;</p><p>Peter raised a brow. This was so weird and confusing his head hurt. Maybe he was still asleep? He slid the note back inside the envelope and left it aside, on his desk, then took the rose and placed in a water vase. </p><p>He finally got to the box and pulled the ribbon, untying the pretty bow on top and opened it, scared and anxious. There could&rsquo;ve been a bomb inside<i>, just saying.</i></p><p>Instead, he saw fabric. Beautiful, dark blue fabric that smelled new and luxurious. He gently pulled it out and damn it- it was a three piece suit, in what seemed to be his size, next to delicately folded white button up. This was Tony&rsquo;s doing. Clearly. He rolled his eyes but couldn&rsquo;t help smiling and blushing. He didn&rsquo;t expect this when Tony said &rsquo;<i>I&rsquo;ll handle the rest</i>&rsquo; but he was happy he did. Of course, he felt so overwhelmed and a bit guilty for making the other spend money on him, but he was gonna pay him back. Eventually.</p><p>At around 6:32 Peter started getting ready. He took a hot shower, washed his hair with some strawberry scented shampoo <i>(cuz it was on sale and he&rsquo;s a broke college student)</i>, shaved and put on some perfume <i>(The cheap kind cuz he can&rsquo;t afford anything else. Tony&rsquo;s gonna change that tho don&rsquo;t worry)</i></p><p>He eventually put on the suit and it fit like a glove- Peter felt <i>gorgeous</i>. His confidence went through the roof for a moment before realizing the suit was probably more expansive than his entire existence. <i>Cue panic attack</i>.</p><p>Before he could worry too much though he heard another knock on the door and checked the time again - 7:58. Okay so maybe it was Tony this time. He rushed to the door and opened it eagerly with the brightest smile on his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey kid&rdquo; the man was standing there, in all his fancy glory, with a hand in his pocket and holding a bouquet of red roses with the other. He wore a suit similar to Peter&rsquo;s, but in black, with a red tie and damn he looked hot. </p><p>&ldquo;H-hey Mrs Stark!
