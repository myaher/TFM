        "body": "<p><b>\u00a0</b>So, this is one of my theories\nthat I will very happy if I am wrong, but that is starting to look more and\nmore probable to happen for me. I have been using the Search of Ice and Fire in\nthe past few days looking for foreshadow of Jon fathering a bastard and voila,\nits actually a quite theme to find on Jon\u2019s story.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re asking, Jon. The Night&rsquo;s\nWatch is a sworn brotherhood. We have no families. None of us will ever father\nsons. Our wife is duty. Our mistress is honor.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<b>A</b> <b>bastard</b> can have honor too,&rdquo; Jon\nsaid. &ldquo;I am ready to swear your oath.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are a boy of fourteen,&rdquo; Benjen said.\n&ldquo;Not a man, not yet. Until you have known a woman, you cannot understand\nwhat you would be giving up.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon felt anger rise inside him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not your\nson!&rdquo;</p><p>Benjen Stark stood up. &ldquo;More&rsquo;s the pity.&rdquo; He put a\nhand on Jon&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;<b>Come back\nto me after you&rsquo;ve fathered a few bastards of your own, and we&rsquo;ll see how you\nfeel.&rdquo;</b></p><p>Jon trembled. &ldquo;<b>I\nwill never father a bastard</b>,&rdquo; he said carefully. &ldquo;<b>Never</b>!&rdquo; He spat it out like venom.</p><p>A GAME OF THRONES \u2013 JON I</p></blockquote><p><br/></p><p>*******************************************************************************************</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a lie,&rdquo; Jon insisted. How could they\nthink his father was a traitor, had they all gone mad? <b>Lord Eddard Stark would never dishonor himself \u2026 would he?</b><br/></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b>He</b> <b>fathered a bastard</b>, a small voice\nwhispered inside him. <b>Where was the\nhonor in that? </b>And your mother, what of her? He will not even speak her\nname.</p><p>A GAME OF THRONES \u2013 JON VII</p></blockquote><p>\u00a0*******************************************************************************************</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;My steward and squire, Jon Snow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<b>A</b> <b>bastard, is it?</b>&rdquo; Craster looked\nJon up and down<b>. &ldquo;Man wants to bed\na woman, seems like he ought to take her to wife. That&rsquo;s what I do.</b>&rdquo;\nHe shooed Jon off with a wave. &ldquo;Well, run and do your service, bastard,\nand see that axe is good and sharp now, I&rsquo;ve no use for dull steel.&rdquo;</p><p>A CLASH OF KINGS \u2013 JON III</p></blockquote><p>*******************************************************************************************</p><blockquote><p>\u201cYou are a free man now, and Ygritte is a free woman. What\ndishonor if you lay together?&ldquo;</p><p>&quot;I might get her with child.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aye, I&rsquo;d hope so. A strong son or a lively laughing\ngirl kissed by fire, and where&rsquo;s the harm in that?&rdquo;</p><p>Words failed him for a moment. &ldquo;<b>The boy &hellip; the child would be a bastard.&rdquo;</b></p><p>&ldquo;Are bastards weaker than other children? More sickly,\nmore like to fail?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, but\u2014&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<b>You&rsquo;re\nbastard-born yourself.</b> And if Ygritte does not want a child, she will go to\nsome woods witch and drink a cup o&rsquo; moon tea. You do not come into it, once the\nseed is planted.&rdquo;</p><p><b>&ldquo;I will not\nfather a bastard.&rdquo;</b></p><p>A Storm of Swords - Jon II</p></blockquote><p>*******************************************************************************************</p><blockquote><p>When the dreams took him, he found himself back home once\nmore, splashing in the hot pools beneath a huge white weirwood that had his\nfather&rsquo;s face. Ygritte was with him, laughing at him, shedding her skins till\nshe was naked as her name day, trying to kiss him, but he couldn&rsquo;t, not with\nhis father watching. He was the blood of Winterfell, a man of the Night&rsquo;s\nWatch. <b>I</b> <b>will not father a bastard, he told her. I will not. I will not.\n&ldquo;You know nothing, Jon Snow,&rdquo;</b> she whispered, her skin dissolving\nin the hot water, the flesh beneath sloughing off her bones until only skull\nand skeleton remained, and the pool bubbled thick and red.</p><p>A Storm of Swords - Jon VI</p></blockquote><p>*******************************************************************************************</p><blockquote><p>They still think me a turncloak. That was a bitter draft to\ndrink, but Jon could not blame them. <b>He</b>\n<b>was a bastard, after all. Everyone knew\nthat bastards were wanton and treacherous by nature, having been born of lust\nand deceit</b>.\u00a0</p><p>A Storm of Swords - Jon VII</p></blockquote><p>\u00a0*******************************************************************************************</p><blockquote><p>A couple of them saw Jon looking down from atop the King&rsquo;s\nTower and waved up at him. Others turned away. They still think me a turncloak.\nThat was a bitter draft to drink, but Jon could not blame them. <b>He was a bastard, after all. Everyone knew\nthat bastards were wanton and treacherous by nature, having been born of lust\nand deceit.</b> </p><p>A Storm of Swords - Jon VII</p></blockquote><p><i>BTW, those quotes its what made me believe in the Political\nJon theories. <b>A bastard child born from lust and deceit fits boatbaby like a\nglove.</b></i></p><p>\u00a0*******************************************************************************************</p><blockquote><p><b>Bastard children were\nborn from lust and lies, men said; their nature was wanton and treacherous.</b>\nOnce Jon had meant to prove them wrong, to show his lord father that he could\nbe as good and true a son as Robb.

Sansa will love the child and be a mother to\nthem.\u00a0The story of Game of Thrones started with Ned Stark starting a war to prevent a bastard son of Cersei Lannister to sit in the Throne and it will end with a bastard daughter of Jon Snow as the heir of the Throne.\u00a0</p><p>History repeat itself and in the end, there wont be much difference between Starks and Lannister, they all lie to protect the ones they love.<b><i>\u201cThe things we do for love\u201d will still be the theme of the story in the end\u2026.</i></b></p><p>Remember when I wrote in another meta that now I believe Jon will pass <a href=\"https://julibf.tumblr.com/post/181557722546/jon-and-sansa-marriage\">HER name to all HIS children?</a>\u00a0Yep, I believe that they will make boatbaby a Stark to protect her.

And that\u2019s exactly what\nArya, Sansa, Cersei, Daenerys, Brienne all are. These women are their father\u2019s\ndaughters.

So, I am starting to believe\nthat Sansa will give birth to a son, but both Jon and Sansa will present their \u201ctwins\u201d\nto the court, which is why they hinted that Sam may assist in a birth in the\nfuture. If they want this secret to be kept at all costs, the only person\nallowed in the birth room would be Sammuel Tarly, Jon Snow most trusted friend.\nJust like Ned trusted Howland Reed to keep Jon Snow birth in absolutely secret.\n</p><p>PS- Now, I want to make sure that I do not like this theory.\nI find quite offensive, no woman should in order to prove they are a good\nmother, love her husband bastard children or the children he may have with\nother women. Sansa does not need to be a loving mother to Jon Snow bastard\nchild to prove she is a good mother, or she is not like her mother (something\nthe fandom believes to be a negative point); she already proved she is\ndifferent from Catelyn whe she embraced Jon as a real Stark on season 6. But\nthis is George RRMartin, and when I was studying Jon\u2019s story arc, the foreshadowing of him fathering a bastard is quite simple too big to ignore, sooooooo<br/></p>",

So, I am starting to believe\nthat Sansa will give birth to a son, but both Jon and Sansa will present their \u201ctwins\u201d\nto the court, which is why they hinted that Sam may assist in a birth in the\nfuture. If they want this secret to be kept at all costs, the only person\nallowed in the birth room would be Sammuel Tarly, Jon Snow most trusted friend.\nJust like Ned trusted Howland Reed to keep Jon Snow birth in absolutely secret.\n</p><p>PS- Now, I want to make sure that I do not like this theory.\nI find quite offensive, no woman should in order to prove they are a good\nmother, love her husband bastard children or the children he may have with\nother women. Sansa does not need to be a loving mother to Jon Snow bastard\nchild to prove she is a good mother, or she is not like her mother (something\nthe fandom believes to be a negative point); she already proved she is\ndifferent from Catelyn whe she embraced Jon as a real Stark on season 6. But\nthis is George RRMartin, and when I was studying Jon\u2019s story arc, the foreshadowing of him fathering a bastard is quite simple too big to ignore, sooooooo<br></p>",

Jon could taste blood in his\nmouth, from the blow he\u2019d taken.</p><p>A Storm of Swords - Jon XII</p></blockquote><p>There is a reason why George RRMartin made Jon repeat so\nmany times that he will never father a bastard. This has to be one of the most\nforeshadowed events of ASOAIF. Jon Snow will father a bastard child with\nDaenerys Targaryen. But I believe that the decision of hiding this girl will\nalso involve Sansa. </p><p>Sansa its only true born child from Ned and Catelyn that had\nto live as a bastard herself in order to survive her family tragedy.

But\nthis is George RRMartin, and when I was studying Jon\u2019s story arc, the foreshadowing of him fathering a bastard is quite simple too big to ignore, sooooooo<br></p>",
                "content": "<p><b>&nbsp;</b>So, this is one of my theories\nthat I will very happy if I am wrong, but that is starting to look more and\nmore probable to happen for me. I have been using the Search of Ice and Fire in\nthe past few days looking for foreshadow of Jon fathering a bastard and voila,\nits actually a quite theme to find on Jon&rsquo;s story.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re asking, Jon.

What\ndishonor if you lay together?&ldquo;</p><p>\"I might get her with child.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aye, I&rsquo;d hope so.

Ygritte was with him, laughing at him, shedding her skins till\nshe was naked as her name day, trying to kiss him, but he couldn&rsquo;t, not with\nhis father watching. He was the blood of Winterfell, a man of the Night&rsquo;s\nWatch. <b>I</b> <b>will not father a bastard, he told her. I will not. I will not.\n&ldquo;You know nothing, Jon Snow,&rdquo;</b> she whispered, her skin dissolving\nin the hot water, the flesh beneath sloughing off her bones until only skull\nand skeleton remained, and the pool bubbled thick and red.</p><p>A Storm of Swords - Jon VI</p></blockquote><p>*******************************************************************************************</p><blockquote><p>They still think me a turncloak.

I made a botch of that. Robb had become a\nhero king; if Jon was remembered at all, it would be as a turncloak, an\noathbreaker, and a murderer. He was glad that Lord Eddard was not alive to see\nhis shame.</p><p>A Storm of Swords - Jon X</p></blockquote><p>*******************************************************************************************</p><blockquote><p>Every morning they had trained together, since they were big\nenough to walk; Snow and Stark, spinning and slashing about the wards of\nWinterfell, shouting and laughing, sometimes crying when there was no one else\nto see. They were not little boys when they fought, but knights and mighty\nheroes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Prince Aemon the Dragonknight,&rdquo; Jon would call out, and\nRobb would shout back, &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m Florian the Fool.&rdquo; Or Robb would\nsay, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the Young Dragon,&rdquo; and Jon would reply, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Ser Ryam\nRedwyne.&rdquo;</p><p>That morning he called it first. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Lord of\nWinterfell!&rdquo; he cried, as he had a hundred times before. Only this time,\nthis time, Robb had answered, &ldquo;<b>You\ncan&rsquo;t be Lord of Winterfell, you&rsquo;re bastard-born.</b> My lady mother says you\ncan&rsquo;t ever be the Lord of Winterfell.&rdquo;</p><p>I thought I had forgotten that. Jon could taste blood in his\nmouth, from the blow he&rsquo;d taken.</p><p>A Storm of Swords - Jon XII</p></blockquote><p>There is a reason why George RRMartin made Jon repeat so\nmany times that he will never father a bastard. This has to be one of the most\nforeshadowed events of ASOAIF. Jon Snow will father a bastard child with\nDaenerys Targaryen. But I believe that the decision of hiding this girl will\nalso involve Sansa. </p><p>Sansa its only true born child from Ned and Catelyn that had\nto live as a bastard herself in order to survive her family tragedy. She even\ngot the feel in her own skin how badly bastard children are seeing and treated\non Westeros</p><p>*******************************************************************************************</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Varys has informers everywhere. If Sansa Stark should\nbe seen in the Vale, the eunuch will know within a moon&rsquo;s turn, and that would\ncreate unfortunate &hellip; complications.

In the scene, Catelyn tells Tallissa that at some\npoint she thought of telling Ned to make Jon a Stark, <b>&ldquo;to give the boy our name\nand make him one of us&rdquo;.</b><br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/00d2994336ce0d037a59444f44c6757b/tumblr_inline_pkodi1w10f1sgp768_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><blockquote><p>CATELYN - When my husband brought that baby home from the\nwar, I couldn&rsquo;t bear to look at him.

A\nmurderer. I&rsquo;d condemned this poor, innocent child to a horrible death all\nbecause I was jealous of his mother. A woman he didn&rsquo;t even know. So I prayed\nto all seven gods, let the boy live. Let him live and I&rsquo;ll love him. <b>I&rsquo;ll be a\nmother to him.

If I give him sons, he may\ncome to love me. She would name them Eddard and Brandon and Rickon, and raise\nthem all to be as valiant as Ser Loras. And to hate Lannisters, too. In Sansa&rsquo;s\ndreams, her children looked just like the brothers she had lost. <b>Sometimes there was even a girl who looked\nlike Arya.</b></p><p>A Storm of Swords - Sansa II</p><p><br /></p></blockquote><p>Here we have Sansa dreaming about her future children, yet\nshe never calls the little girl her daughter, the text makes sure to describe\nthe child as &ldquo;<b><i>a girl</i></b>.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>This passage always reminded me of this one from A GAME OF\nTHRONES.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Ned thought, If it came to that, the life of some child I\ndid not know, <b>against Robb and Sansa and Arya and Bran and Rickon, what would I\ndo?</b> Even more so, what would Catelyn do, if it were Jon&rsquo;s life, against the\nchildren of her body? He did not know. He prayed he never would.</p><p>A Game of Thrones - Eddard XII</p></blockquote><p>Notice that Ned never thinks about Jon&rsquo;s name while naming\nhis children? &nbsp;This was one of our\nbiggest clues who lead us all to R+L=J. </p><p>Since I believe that Jon and Sansa will marry on season 8\nand rule Westeros together I now believe that both of them are gonna lie in\norder to protect this girl. If anyone finds out she is the Queen of Ashes\ndaughter, her life would be in great danger. Jon and Sansa will do the opposite\nof Ned Stark.&nbsp;</p><p>Ned brought <i>a true born prince home and raised as his bastard\nchild</i> in order to protect Jon; Jon will bring home <i>his bastard daughter, and\nraise her as trueborn child</i> in order to protect her. I believe Sansa will lie\nand tell people that the child its hers. They will give them their Stark name\nand raise the baby as one of them. Sansa will love the child and be a mother to\nthem.&nbsp;The story of Game of Thrones started with Ned Stark starting a war to prevent a bastard son of Cersei Lannister to sit in the Throne and it will end with a bastard daughter of Jon Snow as the heir of the Throne.&nbsp;</p><p>History repeat itself and in the end, there wont be much difference between Starks and Lannister, they all lie to protect the ones they love.<b><i>&ldquo;The things we do for love&rdquo; will still be the theme of the story in the end&hellip;.</i></b></p><p>Remember when I wrote in another meta that now I believe Jon will pass <a href=\"https://julibf.tumblr.com/post/181557722546/jon-and-sansa-marriage\">HER name to all HIS children?</a>&nbsp;Yep, I believe that they will make boatbaby a Stark to protect her.
