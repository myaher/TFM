And it was sweet and intimate and romantic. And steamy.</p><p>But a eunuch sex scene was still a weird and unasked for inclusion in a busy season. Why? It added nothing to the plot. I thought at the time,\u00a0\u201cOh dear, Grey Worm is not coming back.\u201d I wasn\u2019t the only one. Most reviewers thought it was included to give emotional heft to his death. But no.

And Jon\u2019s farewell? \u201cI wish you good fortune in the wars to come.\u201d Oh Jon, you smooth talking not-a-bastard.

Not so much.\u00a0</p><p>In fact it isn&rsquo;t until Jon is being taken back to Dragonstone after almost dying that he finally makes a move. She is there crying for her dragon while gazing at him all naked and Jon-like. He gazes into her eyes, grabs her hand and tries to call her a pet name (which she is having none of). (Maybe he will have to recite all her titles to her while making love. It would probably work. Oops I dropped a snark.) I love watching reaction videos. I&rsquo;ve seen several of people watching this scene and in every case, when he says &lsquo;My Queen&rsquo; the reaction is 'What??&rsquo; Because, seriously, where did that come from?</p><p>And so onto the love making scene after the under cooked romance. And suddenly without so much as a \u2018hello\u2019 or a \u2018help me out of this armour\u2019 they are full on doing it while Jon&rsquo;s brother/cousin(!) provides a voiceover about how they are related and how Jon outranks her. Jon looks like he is having a panic attack in flagrante delicto. So much cognitive dissonance I&rsquo;m surprised heads didn&rsquo;t explode.\u00a0</p><p>The whole scene from door knocking to ship sailing lasts two minutes, and this includes door knocking, Tyrion lurking, babies being named and ships sailing.
