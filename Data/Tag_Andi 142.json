The old system led to a lot of kids going off the deep end when their fame came to an end because they couldn't handle not being the centre of attention. The AM kids are seem to know that they have to work hard/have back up career options. Also with AM what's interesting is most of the kids aren't \"Disney Kids\", they each have their own careers in their own rights",

I have talked on this blog before about how I believe the way the industry, particularly Disney Channel, looks out for its younger talent is improving. But to imply that the reason so many child stars have had public breakdowns is because they want or need to be the center of attention is so disrespectful and really minimizing of actual, serious mental health issues.</p><p>In fact, I can\u2019t think of a single Disney star who\u00a0\u201cwent off the deep end\u201d for that reason.\u00a0</p><p>When Britney Spears eventually had her public breakdown, she was going through a divorce and lost custody of her children, had just lost a family member, was struggling with substance abuse, and struggling to gain control of her career - a battle she is still fighting twelve years later.\u00a0</p><p>When Demi Lovato had her public breakdown, she was very much so still the center of attention, which she literally could not handle. She was dealing with drug and alcohol abuse, physical self harm, eating disorders, untreated bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress from childhood trauma, on top of having just gone through a breakup with someone she was on tour with.\u00a0</p><p>When Miley Cyrus broke away from her\u00a0\u201cDisney Image\u201d, it was hardly a breakdown and most of it was actually very strategically planned. But that being said, behind the scenes she was dealing with her parents separating, physical self harm, substance abuse, interpersonal relationship troubles, etc.\u00a0</p><p>And it\u2019s not only the child stars who were\u00a0\u201cthe center of attention\u201d who have these kinds of breakdowns. A lot of the actors who don\u2019t play leads also end up in these positions. Orlando Brown. Mitchell Musso. Adam Hicks.\u00a0</p><p>A lot of the factors that contribute to these breakdowns are external from the industry, and that\u2019s important to note. But the parts of it that are connected to the industry have very little to do with\u00a0\u201cno longer being the center of attention\u201d, and everything to do with the toxicity and irresponsibility of the industry for treating children like adults, while failing to prepare them for actual adulthood.</p><p>A big component is that when child stars grow up, it is often genuinely hard for them to find jobs <i>unless </i>they were the center of attention. If they never became a household name, it\u2019s a lot less likely that they will glide their way through Hollywood. So financial stability becomes a huge factor in the mental health of former child stars. Sometimes child stars only make enough money to provide for their family, which leaves them with little to nothing once their time in the spotlight ends. Sometimes child stars have parents or managers who control all of their money and have already spent or refuse to give it to them once they reach adulthood, so the star ends up in pricey legal battles. Sometimes they just blow through they\u2019re money because they\u2019re teenagers and that is just what kids do without proper guidance. But at the end of the day, if you go from having everything as a kid, to having nothing when you reach adulthood - it\u2019s going to have a major impact on your ability to function in day to day life.\u00a0</p><p>On top of that, child stars are regularly victims of all kinds of abuse. Childhood sexual abuse has been known to occur on sets forever, just as one would suspect. But also the emotional abuse that comes along with being a kid who is expected to be treated like a fully grown adult. It\u2019s rough. And it\u2019s not the kids\u2019 faults. Half of the time, kids don\u2019t even consent to their career in the industry.\u00a0</p><p>To imply that any part of these breakdowns is somehow a choice or selfish is very irresponsible. It\u2019s actually a very serious issue. People have almost died because of this. People HAVE died because of this.\u00a0</p><p>In 2013, one of Disney Channel\u2019s earliest stars Lee Thompson Young (of The Famous Jett Jackson) died by suicide. After his time on Disney Channel, he had graduated from college and continued his acting career. But he was also diagnosed with bipolar disorder and depression. Most people hadn\u2019t thought about him or his role on Disney Channel in years - but as soon as his death surfaced, it became another\u00a0\u201cformer child star goes off the deep end\u201d story, which trivialized the seriousness of his death and his mental illnesses, as well as the severity of child star breakdowns. Lee Thompson Young was a child star success story - until he wasn\u2019t anymore.\u00a0</p><p>Disney Channel, and any other networks who regularly hire child actors, have to start taking more responsibility for their welfare. In the same way that is is a school\u2019s responsibility to make sure that their students are taken care of and prepared for adulthood, it is the industry\u2019s responsibility to do that for the children that work for them. This means better management. This means lessons in financial responsibility. This means more attention to education and child labor laws. This means helping them prepare to them to seek higher education, transition into another work force, or help connect them to new jobs in the same industry once they grow out of their current ones. It means better access to mental healthcare. It means treating child stars like human beings instead of products. It means forming some kind of safety net of resources for former child actors to fall back on when they need HELP, no matter how long it has been since they were an actual child. There is no one clear cut solution, but they have to take steps to protect the children they are pushing into adulthood.</p><p>Now with all that being said - Andi Mack has done a WONDERFUL job at this. Like I talked about <a href=\"https://disneymack.tumblr.com/post/181912129251/why-do-you-think-disney-channel-keeps-casting\">in my original piece</a> about child actors, it really does seem like Disney Channel is taking steps towards making their network a healthier work environment for young people - and a big part of that is not turning them into\u00a0\u201cbrands\u201d as well as letting them move on from their time on Disney Channel while they\u2019re still young. They seem to be allowing their stars to work with other networks far more often, and sometimes even helping them transition to work with sister networks like ABC. The Andi Mack kids are one of the most responsible and hard working examples of child actors in one cast I have ever seen, and their work environment seemed to be the healthiest I\u2019ve ever seen. The separation from the Hollywood lots. Having parents on set, who happen to be mental health professionals. Treating them like actual human beings and allowing them the space to grow and explore other opportunities. The kids were lucky and the show is setting an example for others. I just hope the network, and other networks, follow in these footsteps so that we don\u2019t have to see any more child star breakdowns, or see the actual real-life traumas of former actors reduced to a stereotype or\u00a0\u201ccurse\u201d instead of being taken seriously.</p>",

Sometimes child stars have parents or managers who control all of their money and have already spent or refuse to give it to them once they reach adulthood, so the star ends up in pricey legal battles. Sometimes they just blow through they\u2019re money because they\u2019re teenagers and that is just what kids do without proper guidance. But at the end of the day, if you go from having everything as a kid, to having nothing when you reach adulthood - it\u2019s going to have a major impact on your ability to function in day to day life.\u00a0</p><p>On top of that, child stars are regularly victims of all kinds of abuse. Childhood sexual abuse has been known to occur on sets forever, just as one would suspect. But also the emotional abuse that comes along with being a kid who is expected to be treated like a fully grown adult. It\u2019s rough. And it\u2019s not the kids\u2019 faults.

This means better management. This means lessons in financial responsibility. This means more attention to education and child labor laws.

It means better access to mental healthcare. It means treating child stars like human beings instead of products.

Like I talked about <a href=\"https://disneymack.tumblr.com/post/181912129251/why-do-you-think-disney-channel-keeps-casting\">in my original piece</a> about child actors, it really does seem like Disney Channel is taking steps towards making their network a healthier work environment for young people - and a big part of that is not turning them into\u00a0\u201cbrands\u201d as well as letting them move on from their time on Disney Channel while they\u2019re still young. They seem to be allowing their stars to work with other networks far more often, and sometimes even helping them transition to work with sister networks like ABC. The Andi Mack kids are one of the most responsible and hard working examples of child actors in one cast I have ever seen, and their work environment seemed to be the healthiest I\u2019ve ever seen. The separation from the Hollywood lots. Having parents on set, who happen to be mental health professionals. Treating them like actual human beings and allowing them the space to grow and explore other opportunities. The kids were lucky and the show is setting an example for others. I just hope the network, and other networks, follow in these footsteps so that we don\u2019t have to see any more child star breakdowns, or see the actual real-life traumas of former actors reduced to a stereotype or\u00a0\u201ccurse\u201d instead of being taken seriously.</p>",
                "content": "<p>Sorry that this response is literally nearly three weeks late. At the time you sent it, I think I was really burned out on talking about the whole&nbsp;&ldquo;child star break down&rdquo; thing, but I saved it because I knew it was something I wanted to touch on. Also this is a rant so. Prepare.</p><p>Not to be rude, but I really don&rsquo;t like the fact that you said&nbsp;&ldquo;the old system led to a lot of kids going off the deep end when their fame came to an end <i>because they couldn&rsquo;t handle not being the center of attention</i>&rdquo;. I have talked on this blog before about how I believe the way the industry, particularly Disney Channel, looks out for its younger talent is improving. But to imply that the reason so many child stars have had public breakdowns is because they want or need to be the center of attention is so disrespectful and really minimizing of actual, serious mental health issues.</p><p>In fact, I can&rsquo;t think of a single Disney star who&nbsp;&ldquo;went off the deep end&rdquo; for that reason.&nbsp;</p><p>When Britney Spears eventually had her public breakdown, she was going through a divorce and lost custody of her children, had just lost a family member, was struggling with substance abuse, and struggling to gain control of her career - a battle she is still fighting twelve years later.&nbsp;</p><p>When Demi Lovato had her public breakdown, she was very much so still the center of attention, which she literally could not handle. She was dealing with drug and alcohol abuse, physical self harm, eating disorders, untreated bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress from childhood trauma, on top of having just gone through a breakup with someone she was on tour with.&nbsp;</p><p>When Miley Cyrus broke away from her&nbsp;&ldquo;Disney Image&rdquo;, it was hardly a breakdown and most of it was actually very strategically planned. But that being said, behind the scenes she was dealing with her parents separating, physical self harm, substance abuse, interpersonal relationship troubles, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>And it&rsquo;s not only the child stars who were&nbsp;&ldquo;the center of attention&rdquo; who have these kinds of breakdowns. A lot of the actors who don&rsquo;t play leads also end up in these positions. Orlando Brown. Mitchell Musso. Adam Hicks.&nbsp;</p><p>A lot of the factors that contribute to these breakdowns are external from the industry, and that&rsquo;s important to note. But the parts of it that are connected to the industry have very little to do with&nbsp;&ldquo;no longer being the center of attention&rdquo;, and everything to do with the toxicity and irresponsibility of the industry for treating children like adults, while failing to prepare them for actual adulthood.</p><p>A big component is that when child stars grow up, it is often genuinely hard for them to find jobs <i>unless </i>they were the center of attention. If they never became a household name, it&rsquo;s a lot less likely that they will glide their way through Hollywood.

        "answer": "<p>This turned out to be way longer than I expected lol. I hope you enjoy it!!<br/></p><hr><p><b>14. \u201cWill\nyou stop acting like it never happened?\u201d</b><br/></p><p>Today is the day that Cyrus returns to Shadyside after a month-long film camp. He should be elated to be back, and\nwhile he is glad to be home, he also feels hurt at the thought of it due to one person: TJ. </p><p>It all started right before Cyrus left for\ncamp. The two of them started dating about a month prior to Cyrus\u2019s departure.\nOf course, Cyrus was going to miss TJ terribly while he was away. They had\nfinally gotten into a relationship after months of pining. Cyrus felt complete\nwith him, and wondered how he could have gotten so lucky that TJ would pick him\nto date. </p><p>TJ promised to text and snap Cyrus all the\ntime. They shared a goodbye kiss, and then Cyrus was off to learn more about\nscreenwriting. True to his promise, TJ texted him religiously for the first\nweek. Cyrus most enjoyed his goofy snaps that he\u2019d send of himself. Cyrus\nalways made sure to text back. He missed TJ like crazy, but he was enjoying the\ncamp. He even started making new friends who also liked cinema. Soon, he found\nhimself hanging out with those friends. He made sure to tell TJ all about it. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe that they would even want\nto be my friend!\u201d Cyrus exclaimed into the phone. \u201cBut Jax and Becca are so\ncool!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy for you, underdog,\u201d TJ responded,\nbut he sounded distant. \u201cListen, I have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, okay! Well, I\u2019ll talk to you\ntomorrow. Goodnight.\u201d</p><p>The next day, TJ didn\u2019t text or call.\nCyrus tried multiple times to get a hold of him, but his boyfriend just disappeared.\nFiguring he must be busy, Cyrus distracted himself with camp and while that\nworked for a few days, the lack of TJ\u2019s response to him started to take a toll.\nThere was about one and a half weeks left of camp still, but it was like TJ\ndidn\u2019t even miss him. </p><p>Cyrus\u2019s insecurities began to creep up on\nhim. What if he found someone better and that\u2019s why he was ignoring Cyrus? Or\nhe just didn\u2019t care about him anymore? Soon, all Cyrus can focus on is TJ. It\u2019s\ndistracting him so much that Jax and Becca pick up on it. He can\u2019t sleep, he\nfeels constantly anxious, and despite his attempts to stay rational, the only\nthoughts that enter his mind are irrational.</p><p>Fast forward to the day he gets home, and\nCyrus doesn\u2019t know what to feel. He expects TJ to continue ignoring him, but\nthe opposite happens. The day he gets home, TJ comes knocking at his door. </p><p>\u201cHey, I missed you!\u201d TJ grins, hugging him\ntightly. Cyrus\u2019s arms flop at his sides as he stands there in confusion. </p><p>\u201cUh, hey,\u201d Cyrus mutters.</p><p>\u201cWe have so much TV to catch up on,\u201d TJ says\nas he walks inside, Cyrus trailing awkwardly behind him. \u201cI waited for you to\nwatch it with me.\u201d </p><p>He plops down on Cyrus\u2019s couch, patting\nthe seat beside him. Hesitantly, Cyrus sits down, body rigid and hands flat on\nhis lap. TJ doesn\u2019t stand for that, though. He wraps an arm around Cyrus and\npulls him a bit closer.</p><p>The noise of the TV does nothing to drown\nout Cyrus\u2019s emotions. As he looks at TJ sitting next to him, he feels\ncompletely overwhelmed. On one hand, he realizes just how much he missed his\nboyfriend; he yearns to just lean in and cuddle with him. On the other hand,\nthough, Cyrus feels hurt. He feels confused. He feels angry. </p><p>The plethora of emotions is too much to\nhandle at the moment, so Cyrus just sits there, eyes staring blankly at the TV screen\nas he tries to process everything. </p><p>TJ doesn\u2019t seem to notice. He continues to\nact normal and happy. By the time they watch a few shows, TJ finally gets up\nand says he should be getting home for dinner. </p><p>\u201cWe should have a date. I\u2019m busy with work\nthe next few days, but does Saturday sound okay?\u201d</p><p>Unsure of what to say, Cyrus just nods. </p><p>TJ smiles and says something that shakes\nCyrus to the core. \u201cI\u2019ll text you later tonight!\u201d</p><p>That line alone makes Cyrus\u2019s head spin,\nand the minute TJ leaves he hurries to his room, burying himself underneath his\ncovers hoping that sleep will bring with it a better day. </p><p>TJ continues to act normal. He texts Cyrus\nconstantly to which Cyrus replies half-heartedly, hoping he\u2019ll get the hint. He\ndoesn\u2019t. Soon, it\u2019s the day of their date, and he feels like he\u2019s on the point\nof breaking. </p><p>TJ plans a date in the park. It\u2019s supposed\nto be extremely romantic with a picnic lunch and everything, but Cyrus can\u2019t\nseem to focus on anything else besides what happened a week ago. TJ, though,\nseems perfectly content to ignore the problem as usual. </p><p>\u201cI got you your favorite,\u201d TJ grins, holding\nup a carton of baby taters. </p><p>Cyrus sighs, arms folded. \u201cYeah, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t seemed very happy recently. What\u2019s\nwrong?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong,\u201d Cyrus snaps, plucking the\ntaters out of his hands. TJ frowns, scooting closer. </p><p>\u201cIf something\u2019s bothering you, you can\ntell me. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Something inside Cyrus finally unleashes,\nand he leaps up, pacing back and forth across the grass. \u201cWhy were you ignoring\nme?\u201d</p><p>TJ stands up with him, frowning. \u201cI don\u2019t\nknow what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p> \u201cWill\nyou stop acting like it never happened?\u201d Cyrus begs. \u201cThings can\u2019t just go back\nto normal if we refuse to talk about it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d TJ groans, throwing his hands\nup in the air. </p><p>\u201cBecause it keeps spinning <i>over and over</i> in my head and\u2014\u201d Cyrus\nbreaks off into a sob, tears finally spilling out of the corners of his eyes.\n\u201cAnd it makes me feel like I\u2019m not good enough\u2026 that I\u2019ll never be good enough\nfor you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t care!\u201d</p><p>TJ lips part in surprise, and he tugs\nCyrus into his chest. Cyrus immediately latches on, fingers digging into TJ\u2019s\nback as he clutches the soft fabric of his hoodie. TJ wraps his arms around Cyrus\u2019s\nshoulders, feeling him quake and hyperventilate. The tears won\u2019t stop. Cyrus ugly\nsobs into TJ\u2019s sweatshirt, feeling gross as the tears and snot run together. He\ntightens his fists into the fabric. In that moment he hates TJ, but he also\nloves him so much that it hurts. </p><p>Despite their argument, TJ doesn\u2019t try to\nmove away. He simply holds Cyrus as he cries. Neither know how long they\u2019ve\nbeen there when Cyrus finally calms down to only the occasional sniffle. As he\ncomes back to his senses, Cyrus realizes TJ has been rubbing his back the\nentire time and resting his cheek against Cyrus\u2019s head. TJ allows Cyrus to pull\naway on his own. When he finally decides to leave TJ\u2019s embrace, he instantly\nmisses the warmth. He rubs at his eyes and face which are splotchy and wet. There\u2019s\na notable wet spot on TJ\u2019s sweatshirt right against his chest. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Cyrus sniffles. \u201cI ruined\nyour sweatshirt.\u201d</p><p>TJ grasps his hands. \u201cYou don\u2019t have\nanything to be sorry for. I\u2019m the one who\u2019s sorry. I didn\u2019t know you felt that\nway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you not? I mean, you\u2019re you and\nI\u2019m just\u2026me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust you?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus sighs. \u201cYou can\u2019t pretend like you\ndon\u2019t see it, TJ. You\u2019re an insanely attractive basket-ball player. Anyone\nwould be dying to go out with you. But I\u2019m just some dorky kid.\u201d</p><p>TJ brings their joined hands up to his\nchest. \u201cDon\u2019t you get it, Underdog? I feel the same way! You\u2019re the smartest\nperson I know, and you\u2019re incredibly kind not to mention beautiful. I never\nthought I\u2019d be good enough for you.\u201d</p><p>They lock eyes, and Cyrus realizes just\nhow close they are. Their noses are almost brushing, and their breaths are\nintermingling. </p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you talk to\nme?\u201d Cyrus breathes, resting his forehead against TJ\u2019s forehead. </p><p>\u201cI was scared,\u201d TJ\nwhispers. \u201cI thought maybe you forgot about me while you were gone.

I hope you enjoy it!!<br></p><hr><p><b>14. \u201cWill\nyou stop acting like it never happened?\u201d</b><br></p><p>Today is the day that Cyrus returns to Shadyside after a month-long film camp. He should be elated to be back, and\nwhile he is glad to be home, he also feels hurt at the thought of it due to one person: TJ. </p><p>It all started right before Cyrus left for\ncamp. The two of them started dating about a month prior to Cyrus\u2019s departure.\nOf course, Cyrus was going to miss TJ terribly while he was away. They had\nfinally gotten into a relationship after months of pining. Cyrus felt complete\nwith him, and wondered how he could have gotten so lucky that TJ would pick him\nto date. </p><p>TJ promised to text and snap Cyrus all the\ntime. They shared a goodbye kiss, and then Cyrus was off to learn more about\nscreenwriting. True to his promise, TJ texted him religiously for the first\nweek. Cyrus most enjoyed his goofy snaps that he\u2019d send of himself. Cyrus\nalways made sure to text back. He missed TJ like crazy, but he was enjoying the\ncamp. He even started making new friends who also liked cinema. Soon, he found\nhimself hanging out with those friends. He made sure to tell TJ all about it. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe that they would even want\nto be my friend!\u201d Cyrus exclaimed into the phone. \u201cBut Jax and Becca are so\ncool!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy for you, underdog,\u201d TJ responded,\nbut he sounded distant. \u201cListen, I have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, okay! Well, I\u2019ll talk to you\ntomorrow. Goodnight.\u201d</p><p>The next day, TJ didn\u2019t text or call.\nCyrus tried multiple times to get a hold of him, but his boyfriend just disappeared.\nFiguring he must be busy, Cyrus distracted himself with camp and while that\nworked for a few days, the lack of TJ\u2019s response to him started to take a toll.\nThere was about one and a half weeks left of camp still, but it was like TJ\ndidn\u2019t even miss him. </p><p>Cyrus\u2019s insecurities began to creep up on\nhim. What if he found someone better and that\u2019s why he was ignoring Cyrus? Or\nhe just didn\u2019t care about him anymore? Soon, all Cyrus can focus on is TJ. It\u2019s\ndistracting him so much that Jax and Becca pick up on it. He can\u2019t sleep, he\nfeels constantly anxious, and despite his attempts to stay rational, the only\nthoughts that enter his mind are irrational.</p><p>Fast forward to the day he gets home, and\nCyrus doesn\u2019t know what to feel. He expects TJ to continue ignoring him, but\nthe opposite happens. The day he gets home, TJ comes knocking at his door. </p><p>\u201cHey, I missed you!\u201d TJ grins, hugging him\ntightly. Cyrus\u2019s arms flop at his sides as he stands there in confusion. </p><p>\u201cUh, hey,\u201d Cyrus mutters.</p><p>\u201cWe have so much TV to catch up on,\u201d TJ says\nas he walks inside, Cyrus trailing awkwardly behind him. \u201cI waited for you to\nwatch it with me.\u201d </p><p>He plops down on Cyrus\u2019s couch, patting\nthe seat beside him. Hesitantly, Cyrus sits down, body rigid and hands flat on\nhis lap. TJ doesn\u2019t stand for that, though. He wraps an arm around Cyrus and\npulls him a bit closer.</p><p>The noise of the TV does nothing to drown\nout Cyrus\u2019s emotions. As he looks at TJ sitting next to him, he feels\ncompletely overwhelmed. On one hand, he realizes just how much he missed his\nboyfriend; he yearns to just lean in and cuddle with him. On the other hand,\nthough, Cyrus feels hurt. He feels confused. He feels angry. </p><p>The plethora of emotions is too much to\nhandle at the moment, so Cyrus just sits there, eyes staring blankly at the TV screen\nas he tries to process everything. </p><p>TJ doesn\u2019t seem to notice. He continues to\nact normal and happy. By the time they watch a few shows, TJ finally gets up\nand says he should be getting home for dinner. </p><p>\u201cWe should have a date. I\u2019m busy with work\nthe next few days, but does Saturday sound okay?\u201d</p><p>Unsure of what to say, Cyrus just nods. </p><p>TJ smiles and says something that shakes\nCyrus to the core. \u201cI\u2019ll text you later tonight!\u201d</p><p>That line alone makes Cyrus\u2019s head spin,\nand the minute TJ leaves he hurries to his room, burying himself underneath his\ncovers hoping that sleep will bring with it a better day. </p><p>TJ continues to act normal. He texts Cyrus\nconstantly to which Cyrus replies half-heartedly, hoping he\u2019ll get the hint. He\ndoesn\u2019t. Soon, it\u2019s the day of their date, and he feels like he\u2019s on the point\nof breaking. </p><p>TJ plans a date in the park. It\u2019s supposed\nto be extremely romantic with a picnic lunch and everything, but Cyrus can\u2019t\nseem to focus on anything else besides what happened a week ago. TJ, though,\nseems perfectly content to ignore the problem as usual. </p><p>\u201cI got you your favorite,\u201d TJ grins, holding\nup a carton of baby taters. </p><p>Cyrus sighs, arms folded. \u201cYeah, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t seemed very happy recently. What\u2019s\nwrong?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong,\u201d Cyrus snaps, plucking the\ntaters out of his hands. TJ frowns, scooting closer. </p><p>\u201cIf something\u2019s bothering you, you can\ntell me. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Something inside Cyrus finally unleashes,\nand he leaps up, pacing back and forth across the grass. \u201cWhy were you ignoring\nme?\u201d</p><p>TJ stands up with him, frowning. \u201cI don\u2019t\nknow what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p> \u201cWill\nyou stop acting like it never happened?\u201d Cyrus begs. \u201cThings can\u2019t just go back\nto normal if we refuse to talk about it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d TJ groans, throwing his hands\nup in the air. </p><p>\u201cBecause it keeps spinning <i>over and over</i> in my head and\u2014\u201d Cyrus\nbreaks off into a sob, tears finally spilling out of the corners of his eyes.\n\u201cAnd it makes me feel like I\u2019m not good enough\u2026 that I\u2019ll never be good enough\nfor you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t care!\u201d</p><p>TJ lips part in surprise, and he tugs\nCyrus into his chest. Cyrus immediately latches on, fingers digging into TJ\u2019s\nback as he clutches the soft fabric of his hoodie. TJ wraps his arms around Cyrus\u2019s\nshoulders, feeling him quake and hyperventilate. The tears won\u2019t stop. Cyrus ugly\nsobs into TJ\u2019s sweatshirt, feeling gross as the tears and snot run together. He\ntightens his fists into the fabric. In that moment he hates TJ, but he also\nloves him so much that it hurts. </p><p>Despite their argument, TJ doesn\u2019t try to\nmove away. He simply holds Cyrus as he cries. Neither know how long they\u2019ve\nbeen there when Cyrus finally calms down to only the occasional sniffle. As he\ncomes back to his senses, Cyrus realizes TJ has been rubbing his back the\nentire time and resting his cheek against Cyrus\u2019s head. TJ allows Cyrus to pull\naway on his own. When he finally decides to leave TJ\u2019s embrace, he instantly\nmisses the warmth. He rubs at his eyes and face which are splotchy and wet. There\u2019s\na notable wet spot on TJ\u2019s sweatshirt right against his chest. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Cyrus sniffles. \u201cI ruined\nyour sweatshirt.\u201d</p><p>TJ grasps his hands. \u201cYou don\u2019t have\nanything to be sorry for. I\u2019m the one who\u2019s sorry. I didn\u2019t know you felt that\nway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you not? I mean, you\u2019re you and\nI\u2019m just\u2026me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust you?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus sighs. \u201cYou can\u2019t pretend like you\ndon\u2019t see it, TJ. You\u2019re an insanely attractive basket-ball player. Anyone\nwould be dying to go out with you. But I\u2019m just some dorky kid.\u201d</p><p>TJ brings their joined hands up to his\nchest. \u201cDon\u2019t you get it, Underdog? I feel the same way! You\u2019re the smartest\nperson I know, and you\u2019re incredibly kind not to mention beautiful. I never\nthought I\u2019d be good enough for you.\u201d</p><p>They lock eyes, and Cyrus realizes just\nhow close they are. Their noses are almost brushing, and their breaths are\nintermingling. </p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you talk to\nme?\u201d Cyrus breathes, resting his forehead against TJ\u2019s forehead. </p><p>\u201cI was scared,\u201d TJ\nwhispers. \u201cI thought maybe you forgot about me while you were gone. You seemed\nto be making new, better friends. I couldn\u2019t deprive you of wanting something\nbetter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeej,\u201d Cyrus whispers\nback, \u201cI want you.

                "content": "<p>This turned out to be way longer than I expected lol. I hope you enjoy it!!<br /></p><hr /><p><b>14. &ldquo;Will\nyou stop acting like it never happened?&rdquo;</b><br /></p><p>Today is the day that Cyrus returns to Shadyside after a month-long film camp. He should be elated to be back, and\nwhile he is glad to be home, he also feels hurt at the thought of it due to one person: TJ. </p><p>It all started right before Cyrus left for\ncamp. The two of them started dating about a month prior to Cyrus&rsquo;s departure.\nOf course, Cyrus was going to miss TJ terribly while he was away. They had\nfinally gotten into a relationship after months of pining. Cyrus felt complete\nwith him, and wondered how he could have gotten so lucky that TJ would pick him\nto date. </p><p>TJ promised to text and snap Cyrus all the\ntime. They shared a goodbye kiss, and then Cyrus was off to learn more about\nscreenwriting. True to his promise, TJ texted him religiously for the first\nweek. Cyrus most enjoyed his goofy snaps that he&rsquo;d send of himself. Cyrus\nalways made sure to text back. He missed TJ like crazy, but he was enjoying the\ncamp. He even started making new friends who also liked cinema. Soon, he found\nhimself hanging out with those friends. He made sure to tell TJ all about it. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe that they would even want\nto be my friend!&rdquo; Cyrus exclaimed into the phone. &ldquo;But Jax and Becca are so\ncool!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy for you, underdog,&rdquo; TJ responded,\nbut he sounded distant. &ldquo;Listen, I have to go.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, okay! Well, I&rsquo;ll talk to you\ntomorrow. Goodnight.&rdquo;</p><p>The next day, TJ didn&rsquo;t text or call.\nCyrus tried multiple times to get a hold of him, but his boyfriend just disappeared.\nFiguring he must be busy, Cyrus distracted himself with camp and while that\nworked for a few days, the lack of TJ&rsquo;s response to him started to take a toll.\nThere was about one and a half weeks left of camp still, but it was like TJ\ndidn&rsquo;t even miss him. </p><p>Cyrus&rsquo;s insecurities began to creep up on\nhim. What if he found someone better and that&rsquo;s why he was ignoring Cyrus? Or\nhe just didn&rsquo;t care about him anymore? Soon, all Cyrus can focus on is TJ. It&rsquo;s\ndistracting him so much that Jax and Becca pick up on it. He can&rsquo;t sleep, he\nfeels constantly anxious, and despite his attempts to stay rational, the only\nthoughts that enter his mind are irrational.</p><p>Fast forward to the day he gets home, and\nCyrus doesn&rsquo;t know what to feel. He expects TJ to continue ignoring him, but\nthe opposite happens. The day he gets home, TJ comes knocking at his door. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, I missed you!&rdquo; TJ grins, hugging him\ntightly. Cyrus&rsquo;s arms flop at his sides as he stands there in confusion. </p><p>&ldquo;Uh, hey,&rdquo; Cyrus mutters.</p><p>&ldquo;We have so much TV to catch up on,&rdquo; TJ says\nas he walks inside, Cyrus trailing awkwardly behind him. &ldquo;I waited for you to\nwatch it with me.&rdquo; </p><p>He plops down on Cyrus&rsquo;s couch, patting\nthe seat beside him. Hesitantly, Cyrus sits down, body rigid and hands flat on\nhis lap. TJ doesn&rsquo;t stand for that, though. He wraps an arm around Cyrus and\npulls him a bit closer.</p><p>The noise of the TV does nothing to drown\nout Cyrus&rsquo;s emotions. As he looks at TJ sitting next to him, he feels\ncompletely overwhelmed. On one hand, he realizes just how much he missed his\nboyfriend; he yearns to just lean in and cuddle with him. On the other hand,\nthough, Cyrus feels hurt. He feels confused. He feels angry. </p><p>The plethora of emotions is too much to\nhandle at the moment, so Cyrus just sits there, eyes staring blankly at the TV screen\nas he tries to process everything. </p><p>TJ doesn&rsquo;t seem to notice. He continues to\nact normal and happy. By the time they watch a few shows, TJ finally gets up\nand says he should be getting home for dinner. </p><p>&ldquo;We should have a date. I&rsquo;m busy with work\nthe next few days, but does Saturday sound okay?&rdquo;</p><p>Unsure of what to say, Cyrus just nods. </p><p>TJ smiles and says something that shakes\nCyrus to the core. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll text you later tonight!&rdquo;</p><p>That line alone makes Cyrus&rsquo;s head spin,\nand the minute TJ leaves he hurries to his room, burying himself underneath his\ncovers hoping that sleep will bring with it a better day. </p><p>TJ continues to act normal. He texts Cyrus\nconstantly to which Cyrus replies half-heartedly, hoping he&rsquo;ll get the hint. He\ndoesn&rsquo;t. Soon, it&rsquo;s the day of their date, and he feels like he&rsquo;s on the point\nof breaking. </p><p>TJ plans a date in the park. It&rsquo;s supposed\nto be extremely romantic with a picnic lunch and everything, but Cyrus can&rsquo;t\nseem to focus on anything else besides what happened a week ago. TJ, though,\nseems perfectly content to ignore the problem as usual. </p><p>&ldquo;I got you your favorite,&rdquo; TJ grins, holding\nup a carton of baby taters. </p><p>Cyrus sighs, arms folded. &ldquo;Yeah, thanks.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t seemed very happy recently. What&rsquo;s\nwrong?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Nothing&rsquo;s wrong,&rdquo; Cyrus snaps, plucking the\ntaters out of his hands. TJ frowns, scooting closer. </p><p>&ldquo;If something&rsquo;s bothering you, you can\ntell me. I promise.&rdquo;</p><p>Something inside Cyrus finally unleashes,\nand he leaps up, pacing back and forth across the grass. &ldquo;Why were you ignoring\nme?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ stands up with him, frowning. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t\nknow what you&rsquo;re talking about.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Will\nyou stop acting like it never happened?&rdquo; Cyrus begs. &ldquo;Things can&rsquo;t just go back\nto normal if we refuse to talk about it!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; TJ groans, throwing his hands\nup in the air. </p><p>&ldquo;Because it keeps spinning <i>over and over</i> in my head and&mdash;&rdquo; Cyrus\nbreaks off into a sob, tears finally spilling out of the corners of his eyes.\n&ldquo;And it makes me feel like I&rsquo;m not good enough&hellip; that I&rsquo;ll never be good enough\nfor you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cy&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought you didn&rsquo;t care!&rdquo;</p><p>TJ lips part in surprise, and he tugs\nCyrus into his chest. Cyrus immediately latches on, fingers digging into TJ&rsquo;s\nback as he clutches the soft fabric of his hoodie. TJ wraps his arms around Cyrus&rsquo;s\nshoulders, feeling him quake and hyperventilate. The tears won&rsquo;t stop. Cyrus ugly\nsobs into TJ&rsquo;s sweatshirt, feeling gross as the tears and snot run together. He\ntightens his fists into the fabric. In that moment he hates TJ, but he also\nloves him so much that it hurts. </p><p>Despite their argument, TJ doesn&rsquo;t try to\nmove away. He simply holds Cyrus as he cries. Neither know how long they&rsquo;ve\nbeen there when Cyrus finally calms down to only the occasional sniffle. As he\ncomes back to his senses, Cyrus realizes TJ has been rubbing his back the\nentire time and resting his cheek against Cyrus&rsquo;s head. TJ allows Cyrus to pull\naway on his own. When he finally decides to leave TJ&rsquo;s embrace, he instantly\nmisses the warmth. He rubs at his eyes and face which are splotchy and wet. There&rsquo;s\na notable wet spot on TJ&rsquo;s sweatshirt right against his chest. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Cyrus sniffles. &ldquo;I ruined\nyour sweatshirt.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ grasps his hands. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have\nanything to be sorry for. I&rsquo;m the one who&rsquo;s sorry. I didn&rsquo;t know you felt that\nway.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How could you not? I mean, you&rsquo;re you and\nI&rsquo;m just&hellip;me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just you?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus sighs. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t pretend like you\ndon&rsquo;t see it, TJ. You&rsquo;re an insanely attractive basket-ball player. Anyone\nwould be dying to go out with you. But I&rsquo;m just some dorky kid.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ brings their joined hands up to his\nchest. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you get it, Underdog? I feel the same way! You&rsquo;re the smartest\nperson I know, and you&rsquo;re incredibly kind not to mention beautiful. I never\nthought I&rsquo;d be good enough for you.&rdquo;</p><p>They lock eyes, and Cyrus realizes just\nhow close they are. Their noses are almost brushing, and their breaths are\nintermingling. </p><p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you talk to\nme?&rdquo; Cyrus breathes, resting his forehead against TJ&rsquo;s forehead. </p><p>&ldquo;I was scared,&rdquo; TJ\nwhispers. &ldquo;I thought maybe you forgot about me while you were gone. You seemed\nto be making new, better friends. I couldn&rsquo;t deprive you of wanting something\nbetter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Teej,&rdquo; Cyrus whispers\nback, &ldquo;I want you. I always want you.&rdquo;</p><p>They surge in at the same\ntime, lips clashing. Cyrus feels a sort of raw passion and fury mashed together\nas they kiss. It&rsquo;s desperate and angry and loving. </p><p>Their lips disconnect as\nthey catch their breaths. </p><p>Cyrus says, &ldquo;That was still\na jerk move, you know, ignoring me. I don&rsquo;t think I can forgive you just yet.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ&rsquo;s face falls. &ldquo;Oh,\nyeah. I understand.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to make it\nup to me in texts and kisses.&rdquo;</p><p>He giggles as TJ swoops\nin again, kissing the side of his head. </p><p>&ldquo;Anything for you.&rdquo;</p>",
