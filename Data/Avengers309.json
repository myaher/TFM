He couldn&rsquo;t help though but admire your cheerful expression as you went around and greeted the rest of the team. How you could be so happy all of the time astounded him, especially being on a team where threats and danger were eminent. He admired that the most about you.</p><p>He had met you a few years back when he had first tried to dominate Midgard; even though you were a normal human assassin, you had dared to defy him, and you had actually put up a decent fight that quite impressed him.</p><p>&ldquo;Loki&hellip;?&rdquo; He shook himself from his thoughts and looked up at you, your eyes sparkling. &ldquo;Are you coming or are you staying here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I would rather not embarrass myself.&rdquo; He stated stiffly, looking away.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh please,&rdquo; You laughed, and made your way to the stage. </p><p>Loki watched curiously as you jumped up on to the stage and actually started singing. He didn&rsquo;t realize how wonderful your voice actually was, even though it was to some Midgardian song. </p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;<i>Recommended at the price. Insatiable an appetite. Wanna try?</i>&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>You winked as you confidently belted out the lyrics, and Loki could&rsquo;ve sworn it was at him. He flushed a little, trying to determine if you were singing at him in particular or just in general. And then the thought crossed his mind - Did you like him?</p><p>You&rsquo;d always been pretty touchy-feely with him and you&rsquo;d constantly seek him out to talk to and hang out with, sometimes making inappropriate innuendos that he wouldn&rsquo;t quite get until the next day.</p><p>And then, with a soft fluttery feeling in his chest, he realized that he in fact does like you.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>&hellip;Temporarily out of gas. To absolutely drive you wild, wild. She&rsquo;s all out to get you&hellip;</i>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s looking straight at you, brother,&rdquo; Thor nudged him, nearly knocking him over. He straightened himself out and huffed embarrassedly. &ldquo;<i>Finally</i>, a woman that can actually stand you!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shut up, you blabbering idiot, before she notices.&rdquo; </p><p>But it was true. Your eyes had been boring into his for the majority of the song, staring as if you were looking for something incredibly important. </p><p>You finished your song, your face flushed from the bright stage lights and sat down next to him, offering a tired sheepish laugh. &ldquo;If you guys want me to go back up there, you&rsquo;re going to have to buy me a few drinks.&rdquo;</p><p>Loki smirked and twirled his fingers and all of the sudden a glass appeared on the table in front of you, startling you.</p><p>You playfully narrowed your eyes at him, taking ahold of the glass and taking a sip. &ldquo;Did you like my singing?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, of course. A beautiful woman like yourself gifted with such a talented voice is pleasurable to listen to.&rdquo; He waved nonchalantly, watching as your face blushed a deeper hue. You then smiled at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, thank you, I did it just for you.&rdquo; You then stood and made your way through the crowd towards the bathroom. </p><p>&ldquo;She liKES YOU.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;SHUT IT THOR.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>Permanent Tag List: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAdVaUGhf_MUtbxQPaCKzdQ\">@laurfangirl424</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/meJr7CN88eAWhbpBuLUSlzA\">@sighspidey</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlurPIE51XH2pNmAhOV0mWw\">@mylovefortomholland</a> </p></p>",
