With him. It felt&hellip; Peter felt like a proper grownup. Well,\nmost of the time. Some. Often enough. Unless he allowed himself to remember the\nmore idiotic things he did in the recent weeks, of course.</p><!-- more --><p>As most of the visits went, they were waiting for\nanother round of meds to arrive and Peter was exercising his fingers \u2014 bending them one\nby one, straightening again, making a fist \u2014 while Mr Stark kept a running\ncommentary about current events. Not from around the world, however, these\nPeter got from Friday \u2014 this, what Mr Stark was telling him right now, trying\nto distract him from the unpleasantness of yet another skin graft, was pure\nAvengers gossip. Delivered by the master of snark and quippy nicknames himself.</p><p>&ldquo;And lately,\nit&rsquo;s been Wanda and Strange, all the time. They can barely stand each other&rsquo;s\npresence,&rdquo; his mentor grumbled. &ldquo;How are they going to ever learn to\ncooperate, when every meeting ends up in a screaming match or worse, I don&rsquo;t\nknow. Someone has to make this kindergarten work and it&rsquo;s not going to be <i>me</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then\nwho?&rdquo; Peter asked, fuzzily bemused. &ldquo;I mean&hellip; someone has to, right?\nThey can&rsquo;t go on&hellip; like this? And I mean, why does doctor Stephen argue with\nher?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because he\ndoes not, quote, proscribe to the belief that there is anything of value to be\ngained by listening to an amateur trying to school him in his job, end\nquote.&rdquo;</p><p>He frowned.</p><p>&ldquo;And that\nmeans?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That our\nSorcerer Supreme is not going to listen to some small-town witch with delusions\nof grandeur - again, a quote - and that our local occult practitioner is not\ngoing to talk to the stuck-up stick-in-the-mud again, because why bother.\nAnother quote. Then she started muttering in Russian and that always makes me\nuneasy.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter smothered a\nsmile.</p><p>&ldquo;And what did\nshe want to teach him about?&rdquo;</p><p>Mr Stark looked up\nfrom over his Stark Pad and just rolled his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Magic. I\nmean, I&rsquo;m not even trying to get into details. She <i>is</i> powered by the Mind Stone and he uses Time Stone, so I thought\nthey would be at least more or less in the same book, if the same page is not\non the table, but it seems their, well, brands of magic are utterly\nincompatible and each approaches the ideas of power manipulation from a\ncompletely different angle. Whatever. Not going to meddle with them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Which of them\nis subtle and which would be prone to anger&hellip;?&rdquo; Peter managed a weak\njoke, getting a small laugh out of Mr Stark.</p><p>Everything, in\ngeneral, had been weak in the weeks he had spent in Shuri&rsquo;s &ldquo;hospital\nwing&rdquo;. First, waking up to total darkness, hearing the nearly damning\ndiagnosis of large-scale nerve damage, about the spinal injury, about the optic\nnerve&hellip; and then slow, slow recuperation&hellip; Until the moment like this very\none, like now, when, if he didn&rsquo;t know better, if he didn&rsquo;t know what will come\nlater, he could have said he was, actually, quite fine. Acceptably well.</p><p>But he wasn&rsquo;t. Not\nat all.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t helping\nthat his surroundings and the obvious amount of money going into the machinery\ndedicated to his wellbeing were, to say it delicately, daunting. For a kid like\nhim, a scholarship student in an acceptably reasonable high school, a\u2014 well,\nnot-really-a-superhero (unlike other superheroes, he didn&rsquo;t have a seemingly\nunlimited budget, just a really, really kind benefactor looking after him),\nwell, for such a kid, being housed in a foreign embassy was by itself something\nquite out of the everyday. To add to it the array of monitors, support and all\nthese weird little instruments that both Shuri and doctor Stephen had used, and\nthe procedures he was undergoing&hellip;</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t want to\nimagine the bill for this all.</p><p>It made him <i>antsy</i> and left him with a strong\nyearning for at least a modicum of normality. A public hospital would be a good\nstart. Maybe.</p><p>He knew quite well\nthat there were people out there looking for him and that it wasn&rsquo;t <i>safe</i> in a normal hospital \u2014 and that was\nnot only <i>not safe</i> for him, but for\ndoctor Stephen, for Mr Stark and for Shuri. Well, and it would have been hard\nto be in any normal hospital and receive this kind of treatment, starting from\nShuri&rsquo;s neural repair lasers, to doctor Stephen&rsquo;s magical healing, to the\nsupercharged IV that delivered a triple normal dose of sugars and microelements\nhis body needed.</p><p>And it would have\nbeen very much unsafe for Mr Stark to visit him, judging from the kinds of news\nFriday had been reading to him.</p><p>He looked longingly\nat the Stark Pad his mentor was holding, but then his eyes dropped to his own,\nstill heavily wrapped hands and he sighed, easing down on the pillows.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Peter&hellip;\nyou OK? This last site, it doesn&rsquo;t hurt anymore, right?&rdquo;</p><p>He shrugged\nnon-committally. </p><p>&ldquo;Not\nreally,&rdquo; he mumbled a small lie. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just, I don&rsquo;t have a lot to\ndo. And it&rsquo;s hard to do the research with Friday when I can&rsquo;t see, you know,\nthe schematics. And anyway I didn&rsquo;t want to disturb you, and it usually\ninvolves a lot of talking and Fri repeating big pieces to me, because I don&rsquo;t\nreally work all that well without any visual help\u2014&rdquo;</p><p>A mumbled &lsquo;shit&rsquo;\nfrom his side and a flurry of motion surprised him.</p><p>And so did the\ndouble-sized Stark Pad dropped into his lap.</p><p>&ldquo;New model,\nnot yet on the market,&rdquo; Mr Stark explained hastily. &ldquo;I was supposed\nto give it to you, but what with the arguments and living space arrangements\nand with Stephen clashing with Wanda and then with Shuri, I kind of forgot I\nhad it&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>They both grimaced.</p><p>Doctor Stephen had\nindeed argued with Shuri about the speed at which Peter&rsquo;s treatments were applied.\nHe was very much for slowing down and making the changes more gradually, while\nShuri was pressing for as many grafts, nerve growths and whatever-elses as was\nphysically possible.</p><p>Sometimes Peter\nsided with her, as he wanted this whole thing to be Just Simply Done. It was\nemotionally exhausting to stay in bed, away from home and May and his friends.\nHe wanted to be out, to be doing things. To see with his own eyes that they\nwere all, in fact, alive and well - which he couldn&rsquo;t do right now, because,\nwell, security.</p><p>On the other hand,\ndoctor Stephen&rsquo;s arguments for taking it slow had some merit. His approach\nmeant less pain at the same time, fewer places on Peter&rsquo;s body that needed dressings,\nless stress on his body.</p><p>And, he shamefully\nhad to admit, it meant more time spent with Mr Stark, who seemed to be there\nafter each subsequent treatment, only occasionally replaced by his wife.</p><p>When he thought of\nthis, it was strange, that weird combined guardianship. Between doctor Stephen\nand the adults who felt responsible for his wellbeing, he found himself\u2014 taken\ncare of to the degree he hadn&rsquo;t experienced even when Uncle Ben was still\nalive. It felt, well, luxurious.</p><p>May came by in the\nmornings, before her afternoon shifts, and sat with him, talking quietly about\nthings that were happening in the neighbourhood and in the city, very carefully\nomitting any kind of sensational news that might &ldquo;disturb&rdquo; him. </p><p>Mr Stark visited,\non average, two out of every three days \u2014 calling every time he had to be\nsomewhere else \u2014 and gave him a background of a variety of the Avengers&rsquo;\nactivities \u2014 a complete and quite extensive lowdown on everything that was\nhappening both in the Tower and at the Compound. The missions. The training.\nThe arguments, the gossip and the practical jokes. It made Peter feel at the\nsame time included - by Mr Stark, who obviously shared all this in the spirit\nof 'you should know what these dumbasses are doing&rsquo; - and isolated, being\nunable to join said dumbasses any time soon.</p><p>Mrs Stark \u2014 who\noccasionally reminded him to call her 'Pepper&rsquo; (he was still resisting) \u2014\ntalked to him about books. Of all things, Pepper Potts-Stark turned out to be a\ncloseted fan of the good, old, traditional hard fantasy of all kinds, from\nTolkien up. She was the one who added her collection of audiobooks to Friday&rsquo;s\n&ldquo;family&rdquo; library section, allowing Peter to listen to both the\nclassics and the new things, written in the time Between.</p><p>And now, oh, now he\nwould have access to <i>everything</i>.

He wasn&rsquo;t going to suddenly share with his mentor\nall these nights when he woke up from dreams of being completely immobilised,\nweeks when, upon awakening, he checked his arms and legs - shaky, but there,\nuncertain, but still feeling - and touched each finger in an attempt at\ncontrolling the way his brain was screaming to him that he had lost them, <i>lost them</i>, lost the feeling, lost, lost,\nlost&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;Pete? Pete,\nkid, where did you go?&rdquo;</p><p>He shook himself\noff and tried to smile at Mr Stark, but it must have come across more as\n'sickly&rsquo; than as 'reassuring&rsquo; because he found himself under the close scrutiny\nof his mentor.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong,\nkiddo?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter took a shuddering\nbreath and relaxed into the pillows slightly.</p><p>&ldquo;Just, bad\ndreams. I remembered something.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mhm. You know\nyou can tell me if this becomes too much, right? I can tell both Stephen and\nShuri to back off and give you longer breaks between treatments, so you can\nrelax and&hellip; you know. Convince your body you can be off your guard more often\nthan not.&rdquo;</p><p>Oh, yeah. That.</p><p>Embarrassing.</p><p>Because\nMr Stark had been correct.</p><p>Precisely\nright on the bloody dot.</p><p>He\nhad guessed - intuited, deduced - that Peter had been sustaining his most\nwatchful and stressed mode of operation every second since he awoke from his\ncoma. Sheer stress and uncertainty of the situation had not allowed the\nspidey-senses to calm down, even in his sleep. Every stimulus made them go into\noverdrive, his ears catching even the drip of the leaky faucet in the bathroom\na floor above the hospital enclosure. Not to mention the general activity of\nway too many people in a limited space. Rationally, he knew that there were\nmuch fewer people in the Embassy than in his building in Queens, but his\nfeelings had been veritably screaming, warning him of continued danger, danger\nfrom everywhere around him&hellip;!</p><p>Every\ntime one of his sensors calmed down, another picked up the baton - smell of\nhospital disinfectant attacked him when everything quieted at nighttime, then,\nonce the air exchange system kicked in and removed the chemical odour, his\nbrain served him with an attack of restless legs, which was rather annoying,\nconsidering he could barely <i>move</i>\nthese legs.</p><p>But\nthe worst part? He hadn&rsquo;t known what was wrong. Why everyone seemed to stink or\nshout or pinch him. Why every breeze from the window made him shiver down to\nhis bones. Why even the little hairs on his hands <i>hurt</i> every time they raised.</p><p>Only\nwhen Mr Stark called and plainly asked him about the chances of him running\nhimself ragged by sustaining the fighting mode for so long, he started noticing\nthings. Things that should not have happened, had he &ldquo;powered down&rdquo;\nthe spider. At least, thankfully, he hadn&rsquo;t started to stick to anything - but\non the other hand, this would have been a plain hint at what was going on with\nhim&hellip;!</p><p>But,\nwhen he tried to let go and relax, he found out he couldn&rsquo;t.</p><p>And\nthen Mr Stark came and talked him down.</p><p>That\nhad been humiliating.</p><p>Like\na toddler who screams his throat raw because he doesn&rsquo;t want to go to daycare,\nPeter had to be calmed down, from - what he saw now - a shivering, permanently\nalert wreck, into something resembling normal state.</p><p>Normal\nstate included seeing in normal light without feeling as if someone was\nstabbing his brain with knitting needles. As doctor Stephen explained it, the\nenhanced state was inducing additional activity on the side of his rod cells,\nand since his change, the density of said rods on his retina was apparently\nseven times the standard human norm. This made for very good night vision and\npotentially killing headaches if he didn&rsquo;t learn to cover his eyes in time. Or\nto power the whole thing down.</p><p>Mr\nStark had held him, breathed with him, talked him through several attempts at\ngetting himself under control and in general <i>been there</i>, with him, for long hours, until that primitive,\nprotective part of Peter&rsquo;s brain caught on to the fact that he was actually <i>safe</i>, dammit, and laid off flooding his\nsystem with adrenaline. It was such a relief when it stopped that it was nearly\npainful in itself. </p><p>And\nthen, the next day, he was given was the best gift anyone had ever gotten him.\nHe could have hugged Mr Stark - if not for the fact that he was stuck in bed\nwith an IV in each arm and the man was helping him to put on the glasses\ncorrectly. And they were a blessing. A simple application of his own solution\nfor filtering the light, copied from his suit, combined with the shielding\nprovided by Captain Danvers and what seemed to be a durable polymer of latest\ngeneration gave him a perfectly working pair of shades - with side blocks and\nadjustable strap, much more comfortable than the headband and much more useful.</p><p>And\nnow he had a pad - a <i>Stark Pad!</i> - and\nhis half-dim room and his mentor by his side and a project to work on.</p><p>&ldquo;Friday,\ncan you please bring up the file on photovoltaics?&rdquo; he asked quietly.\n&ldquo;And attach all the notes I added, even the ones made when I was kind of\nsleepy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\ncoming up, Peter. The notes are attached at the chronological points and by\nkeywords.&rdquo;</p><p>He\nlooked up at Mr Stark, who was watching him with a small frown.</p><p>&ldquo;Um.\nI had Friday read my notes back to me and she recorded all the remarks I made\non rereading. It&rsquo;s mostly small edits, but sometimes I had a new idea sparking\nkind of during the re-read&hellip;&rdquo; he trailed off, watching his mentor&rsquo;s\ncrestfallen face. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\njust that&hellip;&rdquo; the man sighed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Peter. I should have\nthought about the pad earlier. But it&rsquo;s just been&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Too\nmany things at once, I know. I usually forgot about this too, since I&rsquo;ve gotten\nso used to this way of working when I was still, you know. And anyway, with my\nhands being still out of commission, I&rsquo;ll have to dictate any corrections I have.\nIt will be faster than the on-screen keyboard and blinking. This will be OK for\ncoding.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You\nare planning to code by\u2026 blinking?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter\ntried to call a semi-optimistic smile to his lips.</p><p>&ldquo;It\u2019s still better than NOT coding at all.\nAt least now I will have a written language reference to check against. Python\nis interesting and I have to catch up with five years of the language\ndevelopment, so\u2026&rdquo;</p><p>Mr\nStark was looking at him with something&hellip; something. Biting his lip.</p><p>&ldquo;OK.\nTell me about these photovoltaics.&rdquo;</p><p>There\nwas a bit of a wobble in that voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Well,\nsince doctor Stephen told me about the number of rods on my retina, I started\nthinking, what about using this for solar power&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Mr\nStark&rsquo;s pad had gone dark as he leaned in closer to have a look.</p><p>&ldquo;Go\non, kiddo.

With him. It felt\u2026 Peter felt like a proper grownup. Well,\nmost of the time. Some. Often enough. Unless he allowed himself to remember the\nmore idiotic things he did in the recent weeks, of course.</p>[[MORE]]<p>As most of the visits went, they were waiting for\nanother round of meds to arrive and Peter was exercising his fingers \u2014 bending them one\nby one, straightening again, making a fist \u2014 while Mr Stark kept a running\ncommentary about current events. Not from around the world, however, these\nPeter got from Friday \u2014 this, what Mr Stark was telling him right now, trying\nto distract him from the unpleasantness of yet another skin graft, was pure\nAvengers gossip. Delivered by the master of snark and quippy nicknames himself.</p><p>\u201cAnd lately,\nit\u2019s been Wanda and Strange, all the time. They can barely stand each other\u2019s\npresence,\u201d his mentor grumbled. \u201cHow are they going to ever learn to\ncooperate, when every meeting ends up in a screaming match or worse, I don\u2019t\nknow. Someone has to make this kindergarten work and it\u2019s not going to be <i>me</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen\nwho?\u201d Peter asked, fuzzily bemused. \u201cI mean\u2026 someone has to, right?\nThey can\u2019t go on\u2026 like this? And I mean, why does doctor Stephen argue with\nher?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\ndoes not, quote, proscribe to the belief that there is anything of value to be\ngained by listening to an amateur trying to school him in his job, end\nquote.\u201d</p><p>He frowned.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\nmeans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat our\nSorcerer Supreme is not going to listen to some small-town witch with delusions\nof grandeur - again, a quote - and that our local occult practitioner is not\ngoing to talk to the stuck-up stick-in-the-mud again, because why bother.\nAnother quote. Then she started muttering in Russian and that always makes me\nuneasy.\u201d</p><p>Peter smothered a\nsmile.</p><p>\u201cAnd what did\nshe want to teach him about?\u201d</p><p>Mr Stark looked up\nfrom over his Stark Pad and just rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cMagic. I\nmean, I\u2019m not even trying to get into details. She <i>is</i> powered by the Mind Stone and he uses Time Stone, so I thought\nthey would be at least more or less in the same book, if the same page is not\non the table, but it seems their, well, brands of magic are utterly\nincompatible and each approaches the ideas of power manipulation from a\ncompletely different angle. Whatever. Not going to meddle with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich of them\nis subtle and which would be prone to anger\u2026?\u201d Peter managed a weak\njoke, getting a small laugh out of Mr Stark.</p><p>Everything, in\ngeneral, had been weak in the weeks he had spent in Shuri\u2019s \u201chospital\nwing\u201d. First, waking up to total darkness, hearing the nearly damning\ndiagnosis of large-scale nerve damage, about the spinal injury, about the optic\nnerve\u2026 and then slow, slow recuperation\u2026 Until the moment like this very\none, like now, when, if he didn\u2019t know better, if he didn\u2019t know what will come\nlater, he could have said he was, actually, quite fine. Acceptably well.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t. Not\nat all.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t helping\nthat his surroundings and the obvious amount of money going into the machinery\ndedicated to his wellbeing were, to say it delicately, daunting. For a kid like\nhim, a scholarship student in an acceptably reasonable high school, a\u2014 well,\nnot-really-a-superhero (unlike other superheroes, he didn\u2019t have a seemingly\nunlimited budget, just a really, really kind benefactor looking after him),\nwell, for such a kid, being housed in a foreign embassy was by itself something\nquite out of the everyday. To add to it the array of monitors, support and all\nthese weird little instruments that both Shuri and doctor Stephen had used, and\nthe procedures he was undergoing\u2026</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to\nimagine the bill for this all.</p><p>It made him <i>antsy</i> and left him with a strong\nyearning for at least a modicum of normality. A public hospital would be a good\nstart. Maybe.</p><p>He knew quite well\nthat there were people out there looking for him and that it wasn\u2019t <i>safe</i> in a normal hospital \u2014 and that was\nnot only <i>not safe</i> for him, but for\ndoctor Stephen, for Mr Stark and for Shuri. Well, and it would have been hard\nto be in any normal hospital and receive this kind of treatment, starting from\nShuri\u2019s neural repair lasers, to doctor Stephen\u2019s magical healing, to the\nsupercharged IV that delivered a triple normal dose of sugars and microelements\nhis body needed.</p><p>And it would have\nbeen very much unsafe for Mr Stark to visit him, judging from the kinds of news\nFriday had been reading to him.</p><p>He looked longingly\nat the Stark Pad his mentor was holding, but then his eyes dropped to his own,\nstill heavily wrapped hands and he sighed, easing down on the pillows.</p><p>\u201cHey, Peter\u2026\nyou OK? This last site, it doesn\u2019t hurt anymore, right?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged\nnon-committally. </p><p>\u201cNot\nreally,\u201d he mumbled a small lie. \u201cIt\u2019s just, I don\u2019t have a lot to\ndo. And it\u2019s hard to do the research with Friday when I can\u2019t see, you know,\nthe schematics. And anyway I didn\u2019t want to disturb you, and it usually\ninvolves a lot of talking and Fri repeating big pieces to me, because I don\u2019t\nreally work all that well without any visual help\u2014\u201d</p><p>A mumbled \u2018shit\u2019\nfrom his side and a flurry of motion surprised him.</p><p>And so did the\ndouble-sized Stark Pad dropped into his lap.</p><p>\u201cNew model,\nnot yet on the market,\u201d Mr Stark explained hastily. \u201cI was supposed\nto give it to you, but what with the arguments and living space arrangements\nand with Stephen clashing with Wanda and then with Shuri, I kind of forgot I\nhad it\u2026\u201d</p><p>They both grimaced.</p><p>Doctor Stephen had\nindeed argued with Shuri about the speed at which Peter\u2019s treatments were applied.\nHe was very much for slowing down and making the changes more gradually, while\nShuri was pressing for as many grafts, nerve growths and whatever-elses as was\nphysically possible.</p><p>Sometimes Peter\nsided with her, as he wanted this whole thing to be Just Simply Done. It was\nemotionally exhausting to stay in bed, away from home and May and his friends.\nHe wanted to be out, to be doing things. To see with his own eyes that they\nwere all, in fact, alive and well - which he couldn\u2019t do right now, because,\nwell, security.</p><p>On the other hand,\ndoctor Stephen\u2019s arguments for taking it slow had some merit. His approach\nmeant less pain at the same time, fewer places on Peter\u2019s body that needed dressings,\nless stress on his body.</p><p>And, he shamefully\nhad to admit, it meant more time spent with Mr Stark, who seemed to be there\nafter each subsequent treatment, only occasionally replaced by his wife.</p><p>When he thought of\nthis, it was strange, that weird combined guardianship. Between doctor Stephen\nand the adults who felt responsible for his wellbeing, he found himself\u2014 taken\ncare of to the degree he hadn\u2019t experienced even when Uncle Ben was still\nalive. It felt, well, luxurious.</p><p>May came by in the\nmornings, before her afternoon shifts, and sat with him, talking quietly about\nthings that were happening in the neighbourhood and in the city, very carefully\nomitting any kind of sensational news that might \u201cdisturb\u201d him. </p><p>Mr Stark visited,\non average, two out of every three days \u2014 calling every time he had to be\nsomewhere else \u2014 and gave him a background of a variety of the Avengers\u2019\nactivities \u2014 a complete and quite extensive lowdown on everything that was\nhappening both in the Tower and at the Compound. The missions. The training.\nThe arguments, the gossip and the practical jokes. It made Peter feel at the\nsame time included - by Mr Stark, who obviously shared all this in the spirit\nof 'you should know what these dumbasses are doing\u2019 - and isolated, being\nunable to join said dumbasses any time soon.</p><p>Mrs Stark \u2014 who\noccasionally reminded him to call her 'Pepper\u2019 (he was still resisting) \u2014\ntalked to him about books. Of all things, Pepper Potts-Stark turned out to be a\ncloseted fan of the good, old, traditional hard fantasy of all kinds, from\nTolkien up. She was the one who added her collection of audiobooks to Friday\u2019s\n\u201cfamily\u201d library section, allowing Peter to listen to both the\nclassics and the new things, written in the time Between.</p><p>And now, oh, now he\nwould have access to <i>everything</i>. He\nwouldn\u2019t need Friday to repeat things to him over and over - he would see them\nand <i>remember</i> properly. That would be\nglorious\u2026!</p><p>He moved to adjust\nthe angle of the screen, but the pad started slipping and his bandaged hands\nwere quite useless in keeping it where it was supposed to be. He tried not to\ndraw any more attention to it, but apparently had made some kind of noise of\ndistress, as immediately his back was being supported and brought up to a\ncomfortable angle, the pad was secured in his lap with the help of a small\nlunch tray and there was an additional pillow supporting his head.</p><p>Mr Stark patted his\nshoulder as he finished by pulling the cover higher up and tucking it around\nPeter\u2019s torso. Seriously. It had the potential to become very, very annoying\u2026\nBut\u2026 Was it so bad that he wanted more of this? Wished for someone to take\ncare of him like that? Like May used to do when he was a little kid and got\nsick every fall \u2014 sitting with him, reading to him, holding him when his\ntemperature went high and stayed there. He didn\u2019t want to be <i>sick</i> as such, but somehow being taken\ncare of held an enormous appeal in his eyes.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t\nsomething he could admit, was it?</p><p>Nope. Not to his\nmentor, not to his aunt and not to the CEO of the company that was apparently\ncounting him as one of their employees.</p><p>And most definitely\nnot to a wizard.</p><p>Because. Let\u2019s be\nserious.</p><p>Nope.</p><p>\u201cFriday, turn\nthe pad on,\u201d Mr Stark said softly. \u201cAnd tie the access to Peter\u2019s\nvoice pattern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, boss.\nDone,\u201d the AI answered - probably in both links they were wearing,\n\u201cPeter, do you want to set up some basic commands that you could use as\nlong as your hands are wrapped?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm\u2026 A nod\nto scroll down, up for up and clicking links on voice command?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is also\na bit of interface that interprets eye movements. You can set it up so that you\nonly have to look at the needed link and blink,\u201d his mentor suggested.\n\u201cThis system is being prepared for various kinds of\u2026 communication\nproblems. For you and some percentage of people, it\u2019s just a case of temporary\ndiscomfort, but there is a huge group of accident victims and folks after\nserious illnesses who need this kind of interface on daily basis, probably for\nthe rest of their lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\nright,\u201d Peter grimaced.</p><p>Oh, right, indeed.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to\ngo into any details though.

Pete,\nkid, where did you go?\u201d</p><p>He shook himself\noff and tried to smile at Mr Stark, but it must have come across more as\n'sickly\u2019 than as 'reassuring\u2019 because he found himself under the close scrutiny\nof his mentor.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong,\nkiddo?\u201d</p><p>Peter took a shuddering\nbreath and relaxed into the pillows slightly.</p><p>\u201cJust, bad\ndreams. I remembered something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhm. You know\nyou can tell me if this becomes too much, right? I can tell both Stephen and\nShuri to back off and give you longer breaks between treatments, so you can\nrelax and\u2026 you know. Convince your body you can be off your guard more often\nthan not.\u201d</p><p>Oh, yeah. That.</p><p>Embarrassing.</p><p>Because\nMr Stark had been correct.</p><p>Precisely\nright on the bloody dot.</p><p>He\nhad guessed - intuited, deduced - that Peter had been sustaining his most\nwatchful and stressed mode of operation every second since he awoke from his\ncoma.

Every stimulus made them go into\noverdrive, his ears catching even the drip of the leaky faucet in the bathroom\na floor above the hospital enclosure.

Rationally, he knew that there were\nmuch fewer people in the Embassy than in his building in Queens, but his\nfeelings had been veritably screaming, warning him of continued danger, danger\nfrom everywhere around him\u2026!</p><p>Every\ntime one of his sensors calmed down, another picked up the baton - smell of\nhospital disinfectant attacked him when everything quieted at nighttime, then,\nonce the air exchange system kicked in and removed the chemical odour, his\nbrain served him with an attack of restless legs, which was rather annoying,\nconsidering he could barely <i>move</i>\nthese legs.</p><p>But\nthe worst part? He hadn\u2019t known what was wrong. Why everyone seemed to stink or\nshout or pinch him. Why every breeze from the window made him shiver down to\nhis bones. Why even the little hairs on his hands <i>hurt</i> every time they raised.</p><p>Only\nwhen Mr Stark called and plainly asked him about the chances of him running\nhimself ragged by sustaining the fighting mode for so long, he started noticing\nthings. Things that should not have happened, had he \u201cpowered down\u201d\nthe spider. At least, thankfully, he hadn\u2019t started to stick to anything - but\non the other hand, this would have been a plain hint at what was going on with\nhim\u2026!</p><p>But,\nwhen he tried to let go and relax, he found out he couldn\u2019t.</p><p>And\nthen Mr Stark came and talked him down.</p><p>That\nhad been humiliating.</p><p>Like\na toddler who screams his throat raw because he doesn\u2019t want to go to daycare,\nPeter had to be calmed down, from - what he saw now - a shivering, permanently\nalert wreck, into something resembling normal state.</p><p>Normal\nstate included seeing in normal light without feeling as if someone was\nstabbing his brain with knitting needles. As doctor Stephen explained it, the\nenhanced state was inducing additional activity on the side of his rod cells,\nand since his change, the density of said rods on his retina was apparently\nseven times the standard human norm. This made for very good night vision and\npotentially killing headaches if he didn\u2019t learn to cover his eyes in time. Or\nto power the whole thing down.</p><p>Mr\nStark had held him, breathed with him, talked him through several attempts at\ngetting himself under control and in general <i>been there</i>, with him, for long hours, until that primitive,\nprotective part of Peter\u2019s brain caught on to the fact that he was actually <i>safe</i>, dammit, and laid off flooding his\nsystem with adrenaline. It was such a relief when it stopped that it was nearly\npainful in itself. </p><p>And\nthen, the next day, he was given was the best gift anyone had ever gotten him.\nHe could have hugged Mr Stark - if not for the fact that he was stuck in bed\nwith an IV in each arm and the man was helping him to put on the glasses\ncorrectly. And they were a blessing. A simple application of his own solution\nfor filtering the light, copied from his suit, combined with the shielding\nprovided by Captain Danvers and what seemed to be a durable polymer of latest\ngeneration gave him a perfectly working pair of shades - with side blocks and\nadjustable strap, much more comfortable than the headband and much more useful.</p><p>And\nnow he had a pad - a <i>Stark Pad!</i> - and\nhis half-dim room and his mentor by his side and a project to work on.</p><p>\u201cFriday,\ncan you please bring up the file on photovoltaics?\u201d he asked quietly.\n\u201cAnd attach all the notes I added, even the ones made when I was kind of\nsleepy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\ncoming up, Peter. The notes are attached at the chronological points and by\nkeywords.\u201d</p><p>He\nlooked up at Mr Stark, who was watching him with a small frown.</p><p>\u201cUm.\nI had Friday read my notes back to me and she recorded all the remarks I made\non rereading. It\u2019s mostly small edits, but sometimes I had a new idea sparking\nkind of during the re-read\u2026\u201d he trailed off, watching his mentor\u2019s\ncrestfallen face. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\njust that\u2026\u201d the man sighed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Peter. I should have\nthought about the pad earlier. But it\u2019s just been\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo\nmany things at once, I know. I usually forgot about this too, since I\u2019ve gotten\nso used to this way of working when I was still, you know. And anyway, with my\nhands being still out of commission, I\u2019ll have to dictate any corrections I have.\nIt will be faster than the on-screen keyboard and blinking. This will be OK for\ncoding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nare planning to code by\u2026 blinking?\u201d</p><p>Peter\ntried to call a semi-optimistic smile to his lips.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still better than NOT coding at all.\nAt least now I will have a written language reference to check against. Python\nis interesting and I have to catch up with five years of the language\ndevelopment, so\u2026\u201d</p><p>Mr\nStark was looking at him with something\u2026 something. Biting his lip.</p><p>\u201cOK.\nTell me about these photovoltaics.\u201d</p><p>There\nwas a bit of a wobble in that voice.</p><p>\u201cWell,\nsince doctor Stephen told me about the number of rods on my retina, I started\nthinking, what about using this for solar power\u2026\u201d</p><p>Mr\nStark\u2019s pad had gone dark as he leaned in closer to have a look.</p><p>\u201cGo\non, kiddo. Tell me how you\u2019d do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I was thinking\nabout this cell structure\u2026\u201d</p><p><i>Tagging based on the interest in previous chapters, so if you don\u2019t want to be included, just let me know :)</i></p><p><i>(if someone wants to be included, I\u2019ll be more than happy to add them!)</i></p><p><i><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJomgQAmy08JhLoKD0xotvQ\" target=\"_blank\">@juni-berries</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJUF9-OuH82Ubc6_Jnje_BA\" target=\"_blank\">@bad-poetry-rants-and-fandoms</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlNFARFgjS__4PgiS6zAhcw\" target=\"_blank\">@hpswl-cumbercookie</a> \u200b <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUO_V5vLoYStzfXuSRokSnQ\" target=\"_blank\">@jessieblackwood</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlGVOqcG1Vcf_e5W6drM7Cg\" target=\"_blank\">@aratinga4</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZLl5TNp7GEIUBkV9jlI2Bg\" target=\"_blank\">@tmnt-leneah</a></i></p>",

With him. It felt\u2026 Peter felt like a proper grownup. Well,\nmost of the time. Some. Often enough. Unless he allowed himself to remember the\nmore idiotic things he did in the recent weeks, of course.</p>[[MORE]]<p>As most of the visits went, they were waiting for\nanother round of meds to arrive and Peter was exercising his fingers \u2014 bending them one\nby one, straightening again, making a fist \u2014 while Mr Stark kept a running\ncommentary about current events. Not from around the world, however, these\nPeter got from Friday \u2014 this, what Mr Stark was telling him right now, trying\nto distract him from the unpleasantness of yet another skin graft, was pure\nAvengers gossip. Delivered by the master of snark and quippy nicknames himself.</p><p>\u201cAnd lately,\nit\u2019s been Wanda and Strange, all the time. They can barely stand each other\u2019s\npresence,\u201d his mentor grumbled. \u201cHow are they going to ever learn to\ncooperate, when every meeting ends up in a screaming match or worse, I don\u2019t\nknow. Someone has to make this kindergarten work and it\u2019s not going to be <i>me</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen\nwho?\u201d Peter asked, fuzzily bemused. \u201cI mean\u2026 someone has to, right?\nThey can\u2019t go on\u2026 like this? And I mean, why does doctor Stephen argue with\nher?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\ndoes not, quote, proscribe to the belief that there is anything of value to be\ngained by listening to an amateur trying to school him in his job, end\nquote.\u201d</p><p>He frowned.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\nmeans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat our\nSorcerer Supreme is not going to listen to some small-town witch with delusions\nof grandeur - again, a quote - and that our local occult practitioner is not\ngoing to talk to the stuck-up stick-in-the-mud again, because why bother.\nAnother quote. Then she started muttering in Russian and that always makes me\nuneasy.\u201d</p><p>Peter smothered a\nsmile.</p><p>\u201cAnd what did\nshe want to teach him about?\u201d</p><p>Mr Stark looked up\nfrom over his Stark Pad and just rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cMagic. I\nmean, I\u2019m not even trying to get into details. She <i>is</i> powered by the Mind Stone and he uses Time Stone, so I thought\nthey would be at least more or less in the same book, if the same page is not\non the table, but it seems their, well, brands of magic are utterly\nincompatible and each approaches the ideas of power manipulation from a\ncompletely different angle. Whatever. Not going to meddle with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich of them\nis subtle and which would be prone to anger\u2026?\u201d Peter managed a weak\njoke, getting a small laugh out of Mr Stark.</p><p>Everything, in\ngeneral, had been weak in the weeks he had spent in Shuri\u2019s \u201chospital\nwing\u201d. First, waking up to total darkness, hearing the nearly damning\ndiagnosis of large-scale nerve damage, about the spinal injury, about the optic\nnerve\u2026 and then slow, slow recuperation\u2026 Until the moment like this very\none, like now, when, if he didn\u2019t know better, if he didn\u2019t know what will come\nlater, he could have said he was, actually, quite fine. Acceptably well.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t. Not\nat all.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t helping\nthat his surroundings and the obvious amount of money going into the machinery\ndedicated to his wellbeing were, to say it delicately, daunting. For a kid like\nhim, a scholarship student in an acceptably reasonable high school, a\u2014 well,\nnot-really-a-superhero (unlike other superheroes, he didn\u2019t have a seemingly\nunlimited budget, just a really, really kind benefactor looking after him),\nwell, for such a kid, being housed in a foreign embassy was by itself something\nquite out of the everyday. To add to it the array of monitors, support and all\nthese weird little instruments that both Shuri and doctor Stephen had used, and\nthe procedures he was undergoing\u2026</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to\nimagine the bill for this all.</p><p>It made him <i>antsy</i> and left him with a strong\nyearning for at least a modicum of normality. A public hospital would be a good\nstart. Maybe.</p><p>He knew quite well\nthat there were people out there looking for him and that it wasn\u2019t <i>safe</i> in a normal hospital \u2014 and that was\nnot only <i>not safe</i> for him, but for\ndoctor Stephen, for Mr Stark and for Shuri. Well, and it would have been hard\nto be in any normal hospital and receive this kind of treatment, starting from\nShuri\u2019s neural repair lasers, to doctor Stephen\u2019s magical healing, to the\nsupercharged IV that delivered a triple normal dose of sugars and microelements\nhis body needed.</p><p>And it would have\nbeen very much unsafe for Mr Stark to visit him, judging from the kinds of news\nFriday had been reading to him.</p><p>He looked longingly\nat the Stark Pad his mentor was holding, but then his eyes dropped to his own,\nstill heavily wrapped hands and he sighed, easing down on the pillows.</p><p>\u201cHey, Peter\u2026\nyou OK? This last site, it doesn\u2019t hurt anymore, right?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged\nnon-committally. </p><p>\u201cNot\nreally,\u201d he mumbled a small lie. \u201cIt\u2019s just, I don\u2019t have a lot to\ndo. And it\u2019s hard to do the research with Friday when I can\u2019t see, you know,\nthe schematics. And anyway I didn\u2019t want to disturb you, and it usually\ninvolves a lot of talking and Fri repeating big pieces to me, because I don\u2019t\nreally work all that well without any visual help\u2014\u201d</p><p>A mumbled \u2018shit\u2019\nfrom his side and a flurry of motion surprised him.</p><p>And so did the\ndouble-sized Stark Pad dropped into his lap.</p><p>\u201cNew model,\nnot yet on the market,\u201d Mr Stark explained hastily. \u201cI was supposed\nto give it to you, but what with the arguments and living space arrangements\nand with Stephen clashing with Wanda and then with Shuri, I kind of forgot I\nhad it\u2026\u201d</p><p>They both grimaced.</p><p>Doctor Stephen had\nindeed argued with Shuri about the speed at which Peter\u2019s treatments were applied.\nHe was very much for slowing down and making the changes more gradually, while\nShuri was pressing for as many grafts, nerve growths and whatever-elses as was\nphysically possible.</p><p>Sometimes Peter\nsided with her, as he wanted this whole thing to be Just Simply Done. It was\nemotionally exhausting to stay in bed, away from home and May and his friends.\nHe wanted to be out, to be doing things. To see with his own eyes that they\nwere all, in fact, alive and well - which he couldn\u2019t do right now, because,\nwell, security.</p><p>On the other hand,\ndoctor Stephen\u2019s arguments for taking it slow had some merit. His approach\nmeant less pain at the same time, fewer places on Peter\u2019s body that needed dressings,\nless stress on his body.</p><p>And, he shamefully\nhad to admit, it meant more time spent with Mr Stark, who seemed to be there\nafter each subsequent treatment, only occasionally replaced by his wife.</p><p>When he thought of\nthis, it was strange, that weird combined guardianship. Between doctor Stephen\nand the adults who felt responsible for his wellbeing, he found himself\u2014 taken\ncare of to the degree he hadn\u2019t experienced even when Uncle Ben was still\nalive. It felt, well, luxurious.</p><p>May came by in the\nmornings, before her afternoon shifts, and sat with him, talking quietly about\nthings that were happening in the neighbourhood and in the city, very carefully\nomitting any kind of sensational news that might \u201cdisturb\u201d him. </p><p>Mr Stark visited,\non average, two out of every three days \u2014 calling every time he had to be\nsomewhere else \u2014 and gave him a background of a variety of the Avengers\u2019\nactivities \u2014 a complete and quite extensive lowdown on everything that was\nhappening both in the Tower and at the Compound. The missions. The training.\nThe arguments, the gossip and the practical jokes. It made Peter feel at the\nsame time included - by Mr Stark, who obviously shared all this in the spirit\nof 'you should know what these dumbasses are doing\u2019 - and isolated, being\nunable to join said dumbasses any time soon.</p><p>Mrs Stark \u2014 who\noccasionally reminded him to call her 'Pepper\u2019 (he was still resisting) \u2014\ntalked to him about books. Of all things, Pepper Potts-Stark turned out to be a\ncloseted fan of the good, old, traditional hard fantasy of all kinds, from\nTolkien up. She was the one who added her collection of audiobooks to Friday\u2019s\n\u201cfamily\u201d library section, allowing Peter to listen to both the\nclassics and the new things, written in the time Between.</p><p>And now, oh, now he\nwould have access to <i>everything</i>. He\nwouldn\u2019t need Friday to repeat things to him over and over - he would see them\nand <i>remember</i> properly. That would be\nglorious\u2026!</p><p>He moved to adjust\nthe angle of the screen, but the pad started slipping and his bandaged hands\nwere quite useless in keeping it where it was supposed to be. He tried not to\ndraw any more attention to it, but apparently had made some kind of noise of\ndistress, as immediately his back was being supported and brought up to a\ncomfortable angle, the pad was secured in his lap with the help of a small\nlunch tray and there was an additional pillow supporting his head.</p><p>Mr Stark patted his\nshoulder as he finished by pulling the cover higher up and tucking it around\nPeter\u2019s torso. Seriously. It had the potential to become very, very annoying\u2026\nBut\u2026 Was it so bad that he wanted more of this? Wished for someone to take\ncare of him like that? Like May used to do when he was a little kid and got\nsick every fall \u2014 sitting with him, reading to him, holding him when his\ntemperature went high and stayed there. He didn\u2019t want to be <i>sick</i> as such, but somehow being taken\ncare of held an enormous appeal in his eyes.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t\nsomething he could admit, was it?</p><p>Nope. Not to his\nmentor, not to his aunt and not to the CEO of the company that was apparently\ncounting him as one of their employees.</p><p>And most definitely\nnot to a wizard.</p><p>Because. Let\u2019s be\nserious.</p><p>Nope.</p><p>\u201cFriday, turn\nthe pad on,\u201d Mr Stark said softly. \u201cAnd tie the access to Peter\u2019s\nvoice pattern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, boss.\nDone,\u201d the AI answered - probably in both links they were wearing,\n\u201cPeter, do you want to set up some basic commands that you could use as\nlong as your hands are wrapped?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm\u2026 A nod\nto scroll down, up for up and clicking links on voice command?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is also\na bit of interface that interprets eye movements. You can set it up so that you\nonly have to look at the needed link and blink,\u201d his mentor suggested.\n\u201cThis system is being prepared for various kinds of\u2026 communication\nproblems. For you and some percentage of people, it\u2019s just a case of temporary\ndiscomfort, but there is a huge group of accident victims and folks after\nserious illnesses who need this kind of interface on daily basis, probably for\nthe rest of their lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\nright,\u201d Peter grimaced.</p><p>Oh, right, indeed.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to\ngo into any details though. He wasn\u2019t going to suddenly share with his mentor\nall these nights when he woke up from dreams of being completely immobilised,\nweeks when, upon awakening, he checked his arms and legs - shaky, but there,\nuncertain, but still feeling - and touched each finger in an attempt at\ncontrolling the way his brain was screaming to him that he had lost them, <i>lost them</i>, lost the feeling, lost, lost,\nlost\u2026</p><p>\u201cPete? Pete,\nkid, where did you go?\u201d</p><p>He shook himself\noff and tried to smile at Mr Stark, but it must have come across more as\n'sickly\u2019 than as 'reassuring\u2019 because he found himself under the close scrutiny\nof his mentor.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong,\nkiddo?\u201d</p><p>Peter took a shuddering\nbreath and relaxed into the pillows slightly.</p><p>\u201cJust, bad\ndreams. I remembered something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhm. You know\nyou can tell me if this becomes too much, right? I can tell both Stephen and\nShuri to back off and give you longer breaks between treatments, so you can\nrelax and\u2026 you know. Convince your body you can be off your guard more often\nthan not.\u201d</p><p>Oh, yeah. That.</p><p>Embarrassing.</p><p>Because\nMr Stark had been correct.</p><p>Precisely\nright on the bloody dot.</p><p>He\nhad guessed - intuited, deduced - that Peter had been sustaining his most\nwatchful and stressed mode of operation every second since he awoke from his\ncoma. Sheer stress and uncertainty of the situation had not allowed the\nspidey-senses to calm down, even in his sleep. Every stimulus made them go into\noverdrive, his ears catching even the drip of the leaky faucet in the bathroom\na floor above the hospital enclosure. Not to mention the general activity of\nway too many people in a limited space. Rationally, he knew that there were\nmuch fewer people in the Embassy than in his building in Queens, but his\nfeelings had been veritably screaming, warning him of continued danger, danger\nfrom everywhere around him\u2026!</p><p>Every\ntime one of his sensors calmed down, another picked up the baton - smell of\nhospital disinfectant attacked him when everything quieted at nighttime, then,\nonce the air exchange system kicked in and removed the chemical odour, his\nbrain served him with an attack of restless legs, which was rather annoying,\nconsidering he could barely <i>move</i>\nthese legs.</p><p>But\nthe worst part? He hadn\u2019t known what was wrong. Why everyone seemed to stink or\nshout or pinch him. Why every breeze from the window made him shiver down to\nhis bones.

With him. It felt&hellip; Peter felt like a proper grownup. Well,\nmost of the time. Some. Often enough. Unless he allowed himself to remember the\nmore idiotic things he did in the recent weeks, of course.</p><p>As most of the visits went, they were waiting for\nanother round of meds to arrive and Peter was exercising his fingers &mdash; bending them one\nby one, straightening again, making a fist &mdash; while Mr Stark kept a running\ncommentary about current events. Not from around the world, however, these\nPeter got from Friday &mdash; this, what Mr Stark was telling him right now, trying\nto distract him from the unpleasantness of yet another skin graft, was pure\nAvengers gossip. Delivered by the master of snark and quippy nicknames himself.</p><p>&ldquo;And lately,\nit&rsquo;s been Wanda and Strange, all the time. They can barely stand each other&rsquo;s\npresence,&rdquo; his mentor grumbled. &ldquo;How are they going to ever learn to\ncooperate, when every meeting ends up in a screaming match or worse, I don&rsquo;t\nknow. Someone has to make this kindergarten work and it&rsquo;s not going to be <i>me</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then\nwho?&rdquo; Peter asked, fuzzily bemused. &ldquo;I mean&hellip; someone has to, right?\nThey can&rsquo;t go on&hellip; like this? And I mean, why does doctor Stephen argue with\nher?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because he\ndoes not, quote, proscribe to the belief that there is anything of value to be\ngained by listening to an amateur trying to school him in his job, end\nquote.&rdquo;</p><p>He frowned.</p><p>&ldquo;And that\nmeans?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That our\nSorcerer Supreme is not going to listen to some small-town witch with delusions\nof grandeur - again, a quote - and that our local occult practitioner is not\ngoing to talk to the stuck-up stick-in-the-mud again, because why bother.\nAnother quote. Then she started muttering in Russian and that always makes me\nuneasy.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter smothered a\nsmile.</p><p>&ldquo;And what did\nshe want to teach him about?&rdquo;</p><p>Mr Stark looked up\nfrom over his Stark Pad and just rolled his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Magic. I\nmean, I&rsquo;m not even trying to get into details. She <i>is</i> powered by the Mind Stone and he uses Time Stone, so I thought\nthey would be at least more or less in the same book, if the same page is not\non the table, but it seems their, well, brands of magic are utterly\nincompatible and each approaches the ideas of power manipulation from a\ncompletely different angle. Whatever. Not going to meddle with them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Which of them\nis subtle and which would be prone to anger&hellip;?&rdquo; Peter managed a weak\njoke, getting a small laugh out of Mr Stark.</p><p>Everything, in\ngeneral, had been weak in the weeks he had spent in Shuri&rsquo;s &ldquo;hospital\nwing&rdquo;. First, waking up to total darkness, hearing the nearly damning\ndiagnosis of large-scale nerve damage, about the spinal injury, about the optic\nnerve&hellip; and then slow, slow recuperation&hellip; Until the moment like this very\none, like now, when, if he didn&rsquo;t know better, if he didn&rsquo;t know what will come\nlater, he could have said he was, actually, quite fine. Acceptably well.</p><p>But he wasn&rsquo;t. Not\nat all.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t helping\nthat his surroundings and the obvious amount of money going into the machinery\ndedicated to his wellbeing were, to say it delicately, daunting. For a kid like\nhim, a scholarship student in an acceptably reasonable high school, a&mdash; well,\nnot-really-a-superhero (unlike other superheroes, he didn&rsquo;t have a seemingly\nunlimited budget, just a really, really kind benefactor looking after him),\nwell, for such a kid, being housed in a foreign embassy was by itself something\nquite out of the everyday. To add to it the array of monitors, support and all\nthese weird little instruments that both Shuri and doctor Stephen had used, and\nthe procedures he was undergoing&hellip;</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t want to\nimagine the bill for this all.</p><p>It made him <i>antsy</i> and left him with a strong\nyearning for at least a modicum of normality. A public hospital would be a good\nstart. Maybe.</p><p>He knew quite well\nthat there were people out there looking for him and that it wasn&rsquo;t <i>safe</i> in a normal hospital &mdash; and that was\nnot only <i>not safe</i> for him, but for\ndoctor Stephen, for Mr Stark and for Shuri. Well, and it would have been hard\nto be in any normal hospital and receive this kind of treatment, starting from\nShuri&rsquo;s neural repair lasers, to doctor Stephen&rsquo;s magical healing, to the\nsupercharged IV that delivered a triple normal dose of sugars and microelements\nhis body needed.</p><p>And it would have\nbeen very much unsafe for Mr Stark to visit him, judging from the kinds of news\nFriday had been reading to him.</p><p>He looked longingly\nat the Stark Pad his mentor was holding, but then his eyes dropped to his own,\nstill heavily wrapped hands and he sighed, easing down on the pillows.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Peter&hellip;\nyou OK? This last site, it doesn&rsquo;t hurt anymore, right?&rdquo;</p><p>He shrugged\nnon-committally. </p><p>&ldquo;Not\nreally,&rdquo; he mumbled a small lie. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just, I don&rsquo;t have a lot to\ndo. And it&rsquo;s hard to do the research with Friday when I can&rsquo;t see, you know,\nthe schematics. And anyway I didn&rsquo;t want to disturb you, and it usually\ninvolves a lot of talking and Fri repeating big pieces to me, because I don&rsquo;t\nreally work all that well without any visual help&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>A mumbled &lsquo;shit&rsquo;\nfrom his side and a flurry of motion surprised him.</p><p>And so did the\ndouble-sized Stark Pad dropped into his lap.</p><p>&ldquo;New model,\nnot yet on the market,&rdquo; Mr Stark explained hastily. &ldquo;I was supposed\nto give it to you, but what with the arguments and living space arrangements\nand with Stephen clashing with Wanda and then with Shuri, I kind of forgot I\nhad it&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>They both grimaced.</p><p>Doctor Stephen had\nindeed argued with Shuri about the speed at which Peter&rsquo;s treatments were applied.\nHe was very much for slowing down and making the changes more gradually, while\nShuri was pressing for as many grafts, nerve growths and whatever-elses as was\nphysically possible.</p><p>Sometimes Peter\nsided with her, as he wanted this whole thing to be Just Simply Done. It was\nemotionally exhausting to stay in bed, away from home and May and his friends.\nHe wanted to be out, to be doing things. To see with his own eyes that they\nwere all, in fact, alive and well - which he couldn&rsquo;t do right now, because,\nwell, security.</p><p>On the other hand,\ndoctor Stephen&rsquo;s arguments for taking it slow had some merit. His approach\nmeant less pain at the same time, fewer places on Peter&rsquo;s body that needed dressings,\nless stress on his body.</p><p>And, he shamefully\nhad to admit, it meant more time spent with Mr Stark, who seemed to be there\nafter each subsequent treatment, only occasionally replaced by his wife.</p><p>When he thought of\nthis, it was strange, that weird combined guardianship. Between doctor Stephen\nand the adults who felt responsible for his wellbeing, he found himself&mdash; taken\ncare of to the degree he hadn&rsquo;t experienced even when Uncle Ben was still\nalive. It felt, well, luxurious.</p><p>May came by in the\nmornings, before her afternoon shifts, and sat with him, talking quietly about\nthings that were happening in the neighbourhood and in the city, very carefully\nomitting any kind of sensational news that might &ldquo;disturb&rdquo; him. </p><p>Mr Stark visited,\non average, two out of every three days &mdash; calling every time he had to be\nsomewhere else &mdash; and gave him a background of a variety of the Avengers&rsquo;\nactivities &mdash; a complete and quite extensive lowdown on everything that was\nhappening both in the Tower and at the Compound. The missions. The training.\nThe arguments, the gossip and the practical jokes. It made Peter feel at the\nsame time included - by Mr Stark, who obviously shared all this in the spirit\nof 'you should know what these dumbasses are doing&rsquo; - and isolated, being\nunable to join said dumbasses any time soon.</p><p>Mrs Stark &mdash; who\noccasionally reminded him to call her 'Pepper&rsquo; (he was still resisting) &mdash;\ntalked to him about books. Of all things, Pepper Potts-Stark turned out to be a\ncloseted fan of the good, old, traditional hard fantasy of all kinds, from\nTolkien up. She was the one who added her collection of audiobooks to Friday&rsquo;s\n&ldquo;family&rdquo; library section, allowing Peter to listen to both the\nclassics and the new things, written in the time Between.</p><p>And now, oh, now he\nwould have access to <i>everything</i>. He\nwouldn&rsquo;t need Friday to repeat things to him over and over - he would see them\nand <i>remember</i> properly. That would be\nglorious&hellip;!</p><p>He moved to adjust\nthe angle of the screen, but the pad started slipping and his bandaged hands\nwere quite useless in keeping it where it was supposed to be. He tried not to\ndraw any more attention to it, but apparently had made some kind of noise of\ndistress, as immediately his back was being supported and brought up to a\ncomfortable angle, the pad was secured in his lap with the help of a small\nlunch tray and there was an additional pillow supporting his head.</p><p>Mr Stark patted his\nshoulder as he finished by pulling the cover higher up and tucking it around\nPeter&rsquo;s torso. Seriously. It had the potential to become very, very annoying&hellip;\nBut&hellip; Was it so bad that he wanted more of this? Wished for someone to take\ncare of him like that? Like May used to do when he was a little kid and got\nsick every fall &mdash; sitting with him, reading to him, holding him when his\ntemperature went high and stayed there. He didn&rsquo;t want to be <i>sick</i> as such, but somehow being taken\ncare of held an enormous appeal in his eyes.</p><p>But it wasn&rsquo;t\nsomething he could admit, was it?</p><p>Nope. Not to his\nmentor, not to his aunt and not to the CEO of the company that was apparently\ncounting him as one of their employees.</p><p>And most definitely\nnot to a wizard.</p><p>Because. Let&rsquo;s be\nserious.</p><p>Nope.</p><p>&ldquo;Friday, turn\nthe pad on,&rdquo; Mr Stark said softly. &ldquo;And tie the access to Peter&rsquo;s\nvoice pattern.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, boss.\nDone,&rdquo; the AI answered - probably in both links they were wearing,\n&ldquo;Peter, do you want to set up some basic commands that you could use as\nlong as your hands are wrapped?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hm&hellip; A nod\nto scroll down, up for up and clicking links on voice command?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is also\na bit of interface that interprets eye movements. You can set it up so that you\nonly have to look at the needed link and blink,&rdquo; his mentor suggested.\n&ldquo;This system is being prepared for various kinds of&hellip; communication\nproblems. For you and some percentage of people, it&rsquo;s just a case of temporary\ndiscomfort, but there is a huge group of accident victims and folks after\nserious illnesses who need this kind of interface on daily basis, probably for\nthe rest of their lives.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,\nright,&rdquo; Peter grimaced.</p><p>Oh, right, indeed.</p><p>He wasn&rsquo;t going to\ngo into any details though. He wasn&rsquo;t going to suddenly share with his mentor\nall these nights when he woke up from dreams of being completely immobilised,\nweeks when, upon awakening, he checked his arms and legs - shaky, but there,\nuncertain, but still feeling - and touched each finger in an attempt at\ncontrolling the way his brain was screaming to him that he had lost them, <i>lost them</i>, lost the feeling, lost, lost,\nlost&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;Pete? Pete,\nkid, where did you go?&rdquo;</p><p>He shook himself\noff and tried to smile at Mr Stark, but it must have come across more as\n'sickly&rsquo; than as 'reassuring&rsquo; because he found himself under the close scrutiny\nof his mentor.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong,\nkiddo?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter took a shuddering\nbreath and relaxed into the pillows slightly.</p><p>&ldquo;Just, bad\ndreams. I remembered something.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mhm. You know\nyou can tell me if this becomes too much, right? I can tell both Stephen and\nShuri to back off and give you longer breaks between treatments, so you can\nrelax and&hellip; you know. Convince your body you can be off your guard more often\nthan not.&rdquo;</p><p>Oh, yeah. That.</p><p>Embarrassing.</p><p>Because\nMr Stark had been correct.</p><p>Precisely\nright on the bloody dot.</p><p>He\nhad guessed - intuited, deduced - that Peter had been sustaining his most\nwatchful and stressed mode of operation every second since he awoke from his\ncoma. Sheer stress and uncertainty of the situation had not allowed the\nspidey-senses to calm down, even in his sleep. Every stimulus made them go into\noverdrive, his ears catching even the drip of the leaky faucet in the bathroom\na floor above the hospital enclosure. Not to mention the general activity of\nway too many people in a limited space. Rationally, he knew that there were\nmuch fewer people in the Embassy than in his building in Queens, but his\nfeelings had been veritably screaming, warning him of continued danger, danger\nfrom everywhere around him&hellip;!</p><p>Every\ntime one of his sensors calmed down, another picked up the baton - smell of\nhospital disinfectant attacked him when everything quieted at nighttime, then,\nonce the air exchange system kicked in and removed the chemical odour, his\nbrain served him with an attack of restless legs, which was rather annoying,\nconsidering he could barely <i>move</i>\nthese legs.</p><p>But\nthe worst part? He hadn&rsquo;t known what was wrong. Why everyone seemed to stink or\nshout or pinch him. Why every breeze from the window made him shiver down to\nhis bones. Why even the little hairs on his hands <i>hurt</i> every time they raised.</p><p>Only\nwhen Mr Stark called and plainly asked him about the chances of him running\nhimself ragged by sustaining the fighting mode for so long, he started noticing\nthings. Things that should not have happened, had he &ldquo;powered down&rdquo;\nthe spider. At least, thankfully, he hadn&rsquo;t started to stick to anything - but\non the other hand, this would have been a plain hint at what was going on with\nhim&hellip;!</p><p>But,\nwhen he tried to let go and relax, he found out he couldn&rsquo;t.</p><p>And\nthen Mr Stark came and talked him down.</p><p>That\nhad been humiliating.</p><p>Like\na toddler who screams his throat raw because he doesn&rsquo;t want to go to daycare,\nPeter had to be calmed down, from - what he saw now - a shivering, permanently\nalert wreck, into something resembling normal state.</p><p>Normal\nstate included seeing in normal light without feeling as if someone was\nstabbing his brain with knitting needles. As doctor Stephen explained it, the\nenhanced state was inducing additional activity on the side of his rod cells,\nand since his change, the density of said rods on his retina was apparently\nseven times the standard human norm. This made for very good night vision and\npotentially killing headaches if he didn&rsquo;t learn to cover his eyes in time.

        "body": "<p>So, I received such a warm welcome from so many people here that I decided to give something back. So, here you have my very first Starker fic! Shoutout to the whole fandom which is just the sweetest.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>You can also read this on Ao3: <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/19349578\">Right here</a></p><p>&ndash;</p><p>warning: underage (Peter is 17)<br/>High School AU - teacher!Tony &amp; student!Peter<br/>&ldquo;Tony hasn&rsquo;t had a moment alone with Peter in forever. He needs to change that - he just doesn&rsquo;t expect their encounter to turn out like that. Maybe it&rsquo;s for the best.\n\n\u201c</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Tony watches the students intensely as they work on their assignments - smirking at their attempts of speaking with their neighbours. He knows the task he has given them is hard and tedious and although it says to do it alone in the book he won\u2019t object to them working with a partner.</p><p>At least they all concentrate on the task. Well, almost -</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d Most of the other students turn their head simultaneously as soon as he utters the name. In the last row, the boy in question freezes like a deer in headlights. It\u2019s honestly adorable. \u201cIt didn\u2019t look like you and Mister Leeds were talking about the assignment. Am I correct?\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>Peter gives him a sheepish and awkward smile but is quick to drop it when he sees Tony\u2019s stoic expression. He watches with delight as the boy bows his head a little and responds in a quiet voice. \u201cNo, Mister Stark. I\u2019m sorry, sir.\u201d The words are directed more into his table than at him but he\u2019s okay with that.</p><p>Even though it means that he can\u2019t watch the boys big, chocolate brown eyes.</p><p>The students are still staring and Tony feels almost bad for putting him on the spotlight like that. Almost. \u201cPlease stay after class, Peter.\u201d The collective \u2018ooh\u2019 that accompanies this request makes him glare at the rest of the class and they are quick to shut up and concentrate back on their work.</p><p>He sits back in his chair for the rest of the lesson - hands behind his head. He almost rests his feet on the desk before he remembers that he\u2019s a teacher and should probably act responsible and as a role model. Isn\u2019t that hilarious?</p><p>His eyes keep on glancing over his students as they scribble down furiously on the paper. None of them notice how their teacher lingers on one head of short, brown curls in particular. The boy doesn\u2019t attempt to talk to Ned again. Instead, his eyes are glued to the paper on his desk.</p><p>Except for the few fleeting times Tony catches him glancing at him from under his thick eyelashes. His lips twitch up every time he does it, showing him that notices and resulting in the boy quickly looking away.</p><p>The bell rings promptly to signal the end of the lesson (and school for that day) and the students all flow out of the classroom in a hurry to get home. All of them except Peter and Ned. The latter walks up to his desk, backpack slung over his shoulder. <br/><br/>\u201cMister Stark, I\u2019m sorry but it was really my fault. I talked to Peter first.\u201d, the boy began explaining while Peter kept seated in his chair in the back row. \u201cHe just answered my question. I should get in trouble.\u201d</p><p>Tony smiles at him. He already holds Ned in the highest regards just from the way Peter often talks about his best friend. He always has the other boy\u2019s back - it reminds him a lot of his and Rhodey\u2019s friendship.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate your loyalty to your friend, Ned but Peter didn\u2019t have to answer you.\u201d Ned is about to open his mouth again, no doubt to protect his friend further but is stopped by a quiet voice from the back. <br/><br/>\u201cNed, stop. It\u2019s alright.\u201d Peter has stood up and is making his way towards Tony\u2019s desk. He\u2019s careful not to let his eyes linger on the boy\u2019s hips and how they sway when navigates himself around the various desks. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>He watches as the friends face each other. \u201cYou sure? I don\u2019t want to get you in trouble, man.\u201d Peter shakes his head and walks over to Ned, putting a reassuring hand on his shoulder and slowly pushing him towards the door.<br/><br/>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s fine.\u201d, he promises and glances at Tony in a silent question for support. Far be it from him to leave Peter hanging. <br/><br/>\u201cYes, don\u2019t worry.\u201d, he explains calmly, doing his best to give him the stern teacher look. He usually is pretty good at that. Well, when he isn\u2019t distracted like he is right now. \u201cI just want to talk to him real quick.\u201d <br/><br/>Ned finally gives up and instead asks Peter if he should wait up for him outside. Tony forces down a laugh when he sees how the boy\u2019s eyes grow big at that in panic before he stutters out a reply. \u201cNo, no. It\u2019s okay.\u201d He grins at him. \u201cYou\u2019ll come over for dinner this evening though, right? May is making something special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it, man.\u201d They exchange their over-long and tedious handshake and then Ned finally walks out the door, closing it behind him - leaving Tony and Peter alone in the room. They both remain where they are for a heartbeat, Peter standing in front of his desk and Tony sitting behind it. <br/><br/>The moment passes and he uses his feet to slowly push himself and the chair back, laughing at the way Peter flinches. He hates when he does that but teasing the boy is just too much fun. \u201cIs something the matter, Peter?\u201d</p><p>Their eyes meet but no words are spoken. Peter just stares at him and Tony raises an eyebrow at his silence. Then, very quietly \u201cNo, Mister Stark. It\u2019s nothing.\u201d He marvels at the boys acting skills, he truly does. They are very impressive. <br/><br/>\u201cWell, I am still expecting an apology for disrupting my class.\u201d, he tells him matter of factly and gets up. His feet carry him to the door - his hand going for the doorknob. It clicks shut and locky easily. \u201cYou&rsquo;re doing that a bit too often in the last time.\u201d</p><p>He turns back, eyes darting to the spot Peter had been frozen too a second ago. He\u2019s not there anymore. Instead, the boy is sitting on the edge of the teacher\u2019s desk with his legs hanging down and slightly swaying. <br/><br/>Tony slowly starts approaching him, mouth twitching up. \u201cWell, well. What is this?\u201d His voice sounds rough, even to himself and it has the wanted effect as Peter lets out a little sound. To his credit, however, it\u2019s the only slip up he lets happen. <br/><br/>The boy\u2019s eyes grow big as he watches him. Tony comes to a halt in front of him, a good distance between them both. \u201cI-\u201d Peter\u2019s voice shakes a bit and he stumbles over his words. He needs to ask him later if he ever thought about making a career as an actor. \u201cI am really sorry about disrupting class, Mister Stark.\u201d<br/><br/>God, he loves it when Peter calls him that. Mister Stark. Especially with that voice. \u201cAre you truly?\u201d, Tony asks while taking a step closer. <br/><br/>\u201cYes!\u201d, he squeaks out quickly. \u201cI am truly sorry. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s gotten into me lately.\u201d His apology sounds sincere but the way his eyes sparkle and his hands excitedly tap against his expensive desk tell him otherwise. \u201cI really don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d, he hums softly while taking another step forward - and another one. He continues until Peter has to physically lean back to avoid being pressed against his chest - not that Tony doubts that that\u2019s what the boy actually wants.</p><p>But the charade isn\u2019t over just now. <br/><br/>He cocks his head to the side and watches his student. \u201cI think I know, though.\u201d He leans forward - his hands resting flat on the desk on both sides of Peter\u2019s body. The boy is trapped - the only way to get more space between them would be if he lied down on his back. <br/><br/>He doesn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cMister\u2026 Mister Stark? Sir?\u201d Tony can feel the boy\u2019s breath on his cheek and his eyes flutter shut for a moment. It\u2019s been a while since he had been so close to him. It\u2019s getting harder and harder to keep this up. \u201cI don\u2019t think I know what you mean. Sir.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s fingers curl around the edge of his desk, his nails digging into the wood. \u201cYou\u2019re on thin ice, Parker.\u201d, he hisses out between his teeth in an attempt to regain the upper hand but Peter smiles softly and his composure melts away.</p><p>He freezes - his body going completely stiff when he feels the faintest touch on the back of his hand. His eyes dart to the side to see Peter\u2019s slender fingers caressing his skin and he can\u2019t stop the loud breath that\u2019s leaving him at the contact. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, sir.\u201d, he says as if there\u2019s nothing else currently happening. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make things hard for you.\u201d</p><p>Oh, he\u2019s good. He\u2019s really, really good. Tony can\u2019t argue with that. He doesn\u2019t say anything, just keeps on watching his student and concentrates on the feel of skin against skin. Peter keeps on mumbling about stuff Tony just can\u2019t bother to listen anymore - too captivated by his pretty face.</p><p>\u201cCan I somehow make it up to you, Mister Stark? I really want to.\u201d His fingers dig into Tony\u2019s hand - \u201cI really do, sir.\u201d and he can\u2019t take anymore. <br/><br/>\u201cEnough.\u201d, he roughly says and whips forward to crash his mouth against Peter\u2019s. The boy lets out a strangled noise at that, clearly surprised at the abrupt action. Usually, they keep this facade up and running for a much longer but this week has been hell so far and he needs to forget it - even if it\u2019s just for a fleeting moment.</p><p>Peter, finally recovering from his brash attack on his mouth, lets his hands wander down Tony\u2019s neck to dig his hands into his back. It\u2019ll probably crumble his expensive suit jacket but he can\u2019t care less about that - not when the boy\u2019s fingers feel so good. <br/><br/>His own hands cup Peter\u2019s face, gently coaxing his lips apart with his tongue. He groans when the boy eagerly gives in and lets him invade his mouth - a satisfied sigh leaving his mouth as well. <br/><br/>Tony is forced to take a step closer so that his thighs are almost painfully pressed into the edge of his desk - all because Peter\u2019s own legs sneak themselves around his waist to pull him closer. <br/><br/>They continue tasting each other until Tony has to pull back, in desperate need for air. He takes deep breaths as the boy wrapped around him lets out a disappointed whine, trying to capture his lips again. The only thing that\u2019s stopping him is Tony\u2019s hands currently cupping his face.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d, he lets out between short and laboured breaths and Tony grins at the way his voice cracks. \u201cPlease, Mister Stark.\u201d, he tries again.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Pete.\u201d, he gently scolds him, his face dropping to Peter\u2019s neck to nuzzle into the soft skin there and taking in his scent. \u201cDrop that. We\u2019re all alone now.\u201d There is no reply but a quiet sigh - he\u2019s clearly enjoying Tony\u2019s attention. <br/><br/>And then - \u201cTony.\u201d He groans into his neck, hands wandering to Pete\u2019s waist and pulling him forward until he almost drops from the desk - anything to get him as close as possible. It can never be close enough. Not now, not ever.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d, he asks while nibbling at the spot right under his ear where he knows it will make the boy squeak and sure enough he lets out a high-pitched sound. \u201cThat\u2019s not a real request, is it, Pete?\u201d He gently bites down before swiping his tongue over the spot to make sure that no bruise will form there. <br/><br/>The last thing he needs right now is someone seeing one of his students leave his classroom with a hickey on his neck - as much as he hates the fact that he can\u2019t do that. <br/><br/>\u201cPlease, Tony.\u201d, Peter tries again, voice a bit steadier this time. \u201cMore.\u201d <br/><br/>\u201cMore?\u201d, he asks.</p><p>\u201cKissing. More kissing. Come on.\u201d He pulls Tony\u2019s face back to crash their lips together once more. He doesn\u2019t object and lets him take the lead for once as their tongues slide against each other. He missed tasting him this past week. <br/><br/>\u201cMissed you.. so much.\u201d, Peter mumbles between kisses as if he read Tony\u2019s mind. \u201cSo, so much.\u201d His hand dig themselves into his dark curls and a shiver runs down his spine. It feels so good to finally feel him again like this. <br/><br/>The glances he manages to sneak in during lessons just aren\u2019t enough. <br/><br/>\u201cI missed you, too.\u201d, he softly tells him. This time, Peter is the one to pull back but his hands keep his hair in a firm grip which is a bit hotter than it probably should be. He watches him intensely with an expression Tony can\u2019t really decipher. <br/><br/>That\u2019s odd. He is proud of the fact that he can read the boy\u2019s face like an open book most of the time even when he tries to hide his true feelings. This is mildly concerning. The closest thing he can read into it is\u2026 surprise, perhaps?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d, he asks, doing his best to sound casual and to swallow the lump that is starting to form in his throat. \u201cDid I do something?\u201d Peter shakes his head and it eases his worries - a bit. <br/><br/>\u201cNo, no. It\u2019s just -\u201d He blinks at him a few times. \u201cYou missed me, too?\u201d This time the surprise in his voice is unmistakable. Tony frowns at him, utterly confused.<br/><br/>\u201cOf course I did. We haven\u2019t been -\u201d He pauses for a second, not sure how to continue. \u201clike this since last week. Why wouldn\u2019t I miss you?\u201d The hands in his hair start to gently massage his scalp and it takes every ounce of his willpower not to lose focus of the conversation.</p><p>Peter is good at making him lose focus, has been since day one.</p><p>\u201cWell, you see\u2026\u201d He cuts himself off again, his head dropping down but Tony catches it and brings his eyes back to his.

Is that really the picture he is painting with his actions? He is pretty sure he is going to be sick. He staggers back but Peter still has his legs wrapped around him and keeps him mostly in place. \u201cIs that what I am making you think?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cNo! No, you don\u2019t!\u201d, he tries to soothe him in a panicked voice but the damage is done.</p><p>\u201cWell, I obviously do if that\u2019s what you think of me!\u201d He attempts once again to free himself from Peter\u2019s grip but the boy clings to him like he\u2019s his lifeline and perhaps, deep down, he is. \u201cPete-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d His voice is loud and there is this underlying fear inside Tony that someone outside might hear them. \u201cI am sorry I said that. I should have kept it to myself. It\u2019s stupid, really.\u201d Now, it\u2019s Tony\u2019s turn to shake his head. <br/><br/>\u201cNo, I\u2019m glad you said it. That gives me the opportunity to tell you how utterly wrong you are, Pete.\u201d The boy\u2019s eyes almost pop out of his sockets at those words and his mouth opens - no doubt to say something against it. Tony is quicker.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t just some fling for me to enjoy and then toss aside when I don\u2019t longer want it.\u201d, he explains, eyes locking with Peter\u2019s. \u201cI don\u2019t know where you got that idea from - I really don\u2019t but the fact that that\u2019s the way you think about this shows me that I have to try harder.\u201d</p><p>The boy doesn\u2019t say anything, his mouth still opened and Tony uses his index finger to softly close it. \u201cYou mean a lot to me, Pete. A lot.

Am I correct?\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>Peter gives him a sheepish and awkward smile but is quick to drop it when he sees Tony\u2019s stoic expression. He watches with delight as the boy bows his head a little and responds in a quiet voice. \u201cNo, Mister Stark. I\u2019m sorry, sir.\u201d The words are directed more into his table than at him but he\u2019s okay with that.</p><p>Even though it means that he can\u2019t watch the boys big, chocolate brown eyes.</p><p>The students are still staring and Tony feels almost bad for putting him on the spotlight like that. Almost. \u201cPlease stay after class, Peter.\u201d The collective \u2018ooh\u2019 that accompanies this request makes him glare at the rest of the class and they are quick to shut up and concentrate back on their work.</p><p>He sits back in his chair for the rest of the lesson - hands behind his head. He almost rests his feet on the desk before he remembers that he\u2019s a teacher and should probably act responsible and as a role model. Isn\u2019t that hilarious?</p><p>His eyes keep on glancing over his students as they scribble down furiously on the paper. None of them notice how their teacher lingers on one head of short, brown curls in particular. The boy doesn\u2019t attempt to talk to Ned again. Instead, his eyes are glued to the paper on his desk.</p><p>Except for the few fleeting times Tony catches him glancing at him from under his thick eyelashes. His lips twitch up every time he does it, showing him that notices and resulting in the boy quickly looking away.</p><p>The bell rings promptly to signal the end of the lesson (and school for that day) and the students all flow out of the classroom in a hurry to get home. All of them except Peter and Ned. The latter walks up to his desk, backpack slung over his shoulder. <br><br>\u201cMister Stark, I\u2019m sorry but it was really my fault. I talked to Peter first.\u201d, the boy began explaining while Peter kept seated in his chair in the back row. \u201cHe just answered my question. I should get in trouble.\u201d</p><p>Tony smiles at him. He already holds Ned in the highest regards just from the way Peter often talks about his best friend. He always has the other boy\u2019s back - it reminds him a lot of his and Rhodey\u2019s friendship.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate your loyalty to your friend, Ned but Peter didn\u2019t have to answer you.\u201d Ned is about to open his mouth again, no doubt to protect his friend further but is stopped by a quiet voice from the back. <br><br>\u201cNed, stop. It\u2019s alright.\u201d Peter has stood up and is making his way towards Tony\u2019s desk. He\u2019s careful not to let his eyes linger on the boy\u2019s hips and how they sway when navigates himself around the various desks. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>He watches as the friends face each other. \u201cYou sure? I don\u2019t want to get you in trouble, man.\u201d Peter shakes his head and walks over to Ned, putting a reassuring hand on his shoulder and slowly pushing him towards the door.<br><br>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s fine.\u201d, he promises and glances at Tony in a silent question for support. Far be it from him to leave Peter hanging. <br><br>\u201cYes, don\u2019t worry.\u201d, he explains calmly, doing his best to give him the stern teacher look. He usually is pretty good at that. Well, when he isn\u2019t distracted like he is right now. \u201cI just want to talk to him real quick.\u201d <br><br>Ned finally gives up and instead asks Peter if he should wait up for him outside. Tony forces down a laugh when he sees how the boy\u2019s eyes grow big at that in panic before he stutters out a reply. \u201cNo, no. It\u2019s okay.\u201d He grins at him. \u201cYou\u2019ll come over for dinner this evening though, right? May is making something special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it, man.\u201d They exchange their over-long and tedious handshake and then Ned finally walks out the door, closing it behind him - leaving Tony and Peter alone in the room. They both remain where they are for a heartbeat, Peter standing in front of his desk and Tony sitting behind it. <br><br>The moment passes and he uses his feet to slowly push himself and the chair back, laughing at the way Peter flinches. He hates when he does that but teasing the boy is just too much fun. \u201cIs something the matter, Peter?\u201d</p><p>Their eyes meet but no words are spoken. Peter just stares at him and Tony raises an eyebrow at his silence. Then, very quietly \u201cNo, Mister Stark. It\u2019s nothing.\u201d He marvels at the boys acting skills, he truly does. They are very impressive. <br><br>\u201cWell, I am still expecting an apology for disrupting my class.\u201d, he tells him matter of factly and gets up. His feet carry him to the door - his hand going for the doorknob. It clicks shut and locky easily. \u201cYou\u2019re doing that a bit too often in the last time.\u201d</p><p>He turns back, eyes darting to the spot Peter had been frozen too a second ago. He\u2019s not there anymore. Instead, the boy is sitting on the edge of the teacher\u2019s desk with his legs hanging down and slightly swaying. <br><br>Tony slowly starts approaching him, mouth twitching up. \u201cWell, well. What is this?\u201d His voice sounds rough, even to himself and it has the wanted effect as Peter lets out a little sound. To his credit, however, it\u2019s the only slip up he lets happen. <br><br>The boy\u2019s eyes grow big as he watches him. Tony comes to a halt in front of him, a good distance between them both. \u201cI-\u201d Peter\u2019s voice shakes a bit and he stumbles over his words. He needs to ask him later if he ever thought about making a career as an actor. \u201cI am really sorry about disrupting class, Mister Stark.\u201d<br><br>God, he loves it when Peter calls him that. Mister Stark. Especially with that voice. \u201cAre you truly?\u201d, Tony asks while taking a step closer. <br><br>\u201cYes!\u201d, he squeaks out quickly. \u201cI am truly sorry. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s gotten into me lately.\u201d His apology sounds sincere but the way his eyes sparkle and his hands excitedly tap against his expensive desk tell him otherwise. \u201cI really don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d, he hums softly while taking another step forward - and another one. He continues until Peter has to physically lean back to avoid being pressed against his chest - not that Tony doubts that that\u2019s what the boy actually wants.</p><p>But the charade isn\u2019t over just now. <br><br>He cocks his head to the side and watches his student. \u201cI think I know, though.\u201d He leans forward - his hands resting flat on the desk on both sides of Peter\u2019s body. The boy is trapped - the only way to get more space between them would be if he lied down on his back. <br><br>He doesn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cMister\u2026 Mister Stark? Sir?\u201d Tony can feel the boy\u2019s breath on his cheek and his eyes flutter shut for a moment. It\u2019s been a while since he had been so close to him. It\u2019s getting harder and harder to keep this up. \u201cI don\u2019t think I know what you mean. Sir.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s fingers curl around the edge of his desk, his nails digging into the wood. \u201cYou\u2019re on thin ice, Parker.\u201d, he hisses out between his teeth in an attempt to regain the upper hand but Peter smiles softly and his composure melts away.</p><p>He freezes - his body going completely stiff when he feels the faintest touch on the back of his hand. His eyes dart to the side to see Peter\u2019s slender fingers caressing his skin and he can\u2019t stop the loud breath that\u2019s leaving him at the contact. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, sir.\u201d, he says as if there\u2019s nothing else currently happening. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make things hard for you.\u201d</p><p>Oh, he\u2019s good. He\u2019s really, really good. Tony can\u2019t argue with that. He doesn\u2019t say anything, just keeps on watching his student and concentrates on the feel of skin against skin. Peter keeps on mumbling about stuff Tony just can\u2019t bother to listen anymore - too captivated by his pretty face.</p><p>\u201cCan I somehow make it up to you, Mister Stark? I really want to.\u201d His fingers dig into Tony\u2019s hand - \u201cI really do, sir.\u201d and he can\u2019t take anymore. <br><br>\u201cEnough.\u201d, he roughly says and whips forward to crash his mouth against Peter\u2019s. The boy lets out a strangled noise at that, clearly surprised at the abrupt action. Usually, they keep this facade up and running for a much longer but this week has been hell so far and he needs to forget it - even if it\u2019s just for a fleeting moment.</p><p>Peter, finally recovering from his brash attack on his mouth, lets his hands wander down Tony\u2019s neck to dig his hands into his back. It\u2019ll probably crumble his expensive suit jacket but he can\u2019t care less about that - not when the boy\u2019s fingers feel so good. <br><br>His own hands cup Peter\u2019s face, gently coaxing his lips apart with his tongue. He groans when the boy eagerly gives in and lets him invade his mouth - a satisfied sigh leaving his mouth as well. <br><br>Tony is forced to take a step closer so that his thighs are almost painfully pressed into the edge of his desk - all because Peter\u2019s own legs sneak themselves around his waist to pull him closer. <br><br>They continue tasting each other until Tony has to pull back, in desperate need for air. He takes deep breaths as the boy wrapped around him lets out a disappointed whine, trying to capture his lips again. The only thing that\u2019s stopping him is Tony\u2019s hands currently cupping his face.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d, he lets out between short and laboured breaths and Tony grins at the way his voice cracks. \u201cPlease, Mister Stark.\u201d, he tries again.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Pete.\u201d, he gently scolds him, his face dropping to Peter\u2019s neck to nuzzle into the soft skin there and taking in his scent. \u201cDrop that. We\u2019re all alone now.\u201d There is no reply but a quiet sigh - he\u2019s clearly enjoying Tony\u2019s attention. <br><br>And then - \u201cTony.\u201d He groans into his neck, hands wandering to Pete\u2019s waist and pulling him forward until he almost drops from the desk - anything to get him as close as possible. It can never be close enough. Not now, not ever.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d, he asks while nibbling at the spot right under his ear where he knows it will make the boy squeak and sure enough he lets out a high-pitched sound. \u201cThat\u2019s not a real request, is it, Pete?\u201d He gently bites down before swiping his tongue over the spot to make sure that no bruise will form there. <br><br>The last thing he needs right now is someone seeing one of his students leave his classroom with a hickey on his neck - as much as he hates the fact that he can\u2019t do that. <br><br>\u201cPlease, Tony.\u201d, Peter tries again, voice a bit steadier this time. \u201cMore.\u201d <br><br>\u201cMore?\u201d, he asks.</p><p>\u201cKissing. More kissing. Come on.\u201d He pulls Tony\u2019s face back to crash their lips together once more. He doesn\u2019t object and lets him take the lead for once as their tongues slide against each other. He missed tasting him this past week. <br><br>\u201cMissed you.. so much.\u201d, Peter mumbles between kisses as if he read Tony\u2019s mind. \u201cSo, so much.\u201d His hand dig themselves into his dark curls and a shiver runs down his spine. It feels so good to finally feel him again like this. <br><br>The glances he manages to sneak in during lessons just aren\u2019t enough. <br><br>\u201cI missed you, too.\u201d, he softly tells him. This time, Peter is the one to pull back but his hands keep his hair in a firm grip which is a bit hotter than it probably should be. He watches him intensely with an expression Tony can\u2019t really decipher. <br><br>That\u2019s odd. He is proud of the fact that he can read the boy\u2019s face like an open book most of the time even when he tries to hide his true feelings. This is mildly concerning. The closest thing he can read into it is\u2026 surprise, perhaps?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d, he asks, doing his best to sound casual and to swallow the lump that is starting to form in his throat. \u201cDid I do something?\u201d Peter shakes his head and it eases his worries - a bit. <br><br>\u201cNo, no. It\u2019s just -\u201d He blinks at him a few times. \u201cYou missed me, too?\u201d This time the surprise in his voice is unmistakable. Tony frowns at him, utterly confused.<br><br>\u201cOf course I did. We haven\u2019t been -\u201d He pauses for a second, not sure how to continue. \u201clike this since last week. Why wouldn\u2019t I miss you?\u201d The hands in his hair start to gently massage his scalp and it takes every ounce of his willpower not to lose focus of the conversation.</p><p>Peter is good at making him lose focus, has been since day one.</p><p>\u201cWell, you see\u2026\u201d He cuts himself off again, his head dropping down but Tony catches it and brings his eyes back to his. Peter nervously hums and he swipes his thumbs over his cheeks to ease the worry behind his eyes. <br><br>\u201cTell me, Pete.\u201d, he pleads.</p><p>\u201cI just thought that - like it\u2019s obvious that I like you. You know, a lot.\u201d Tony\u2019s heart flutters. \u201cBut I always thought that you.. uhm. You\u2019re much older and obviously looking for something else in the long run so I -\u201d<br><br>He stares at him in horror, shock and slight disgust - mostly at himself. \u201cYou think\u2026 that I am just playing with you?\u201d He lets out a shuddering breath. \u201cThat I am with you as some sick sort of pastime?\u201d</p><p>He can\u2019t believe that Peter can even think something like that. Is that really the picture he is painting with his actions? He is pretty sure he is going to be sick. He staggers back but Peter still has his legs wrapped around him and keeps him mostly in place. \u201cIs that what I am making you think?\u201d<br><br>\u201cNo!

I should have kept it to myself. It\u2019s stupid, really.\u201d Now, it\u2019s Tony\u2019s turn to shake his head. <br><br>\u201cNo, I\u2019m glad you said it.

Am I correct?\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>Peter gives him a sheepish and awkward smile but is quick to drop it when he sees Tony\u2019s stoic expression. He watches with delight as the boy bows his head a little and responds in a quiet voice. \u201cNo, Mister Stark. I\u2019m sorry, sir.\u201d The words are directed more into his table than at him but he\u2019s okay with that.</p><p>Even though it means that he can\u2019t watch the boys big, chocolate brown eyes.</p><p>The students are still staring and Tony feels almost bad for putting him on the spotlight like that. Almost. \u201cPlease stay after class, Peter.\u201d The collective \u2018ooh\u2019 that accompanies this request makes him glare at the rest of the class and they are quick to shut up and concentrate back on their work.</p><p>He sits back in his chair for the rest of the lesson - hands behind his head. He almost rests his feet on the desk before he remembers that he\u2019s a teacher and should probably act responsible and as a role model. Isn\u2019t that hilarious?</p><p>His eyes keep on glancing over his students as they scribble down furiously on the paper. None of them notice how their teacher lingers on one head of short, brown curls in particular. The boy doesn\u2019t attempt to talk to Ned again. Instead, his eyes are glued to the paper on his desk.</p><p>Except for the few fleeting times Tony catches him glancing at him from under his thick eyelashes. His lips twitch up every time he does it, showing him that notices and resulting in the boy quickly looking away.</p><p>The bell rings promptly to signal the end of the lesson (and school for that day) and the students all flow out of the classroom in a hurry to get home. All of them except Peter and Ned. The latter walks up to his desk, backpack slung over his shoulder. <br><br>\u201cMister Stark, I\u2019m sorry but it was really my fault. I talked to Peter first.\u201d, the boy began explaining while Peter kept seated in his chair in the back row. \u201cHe just answered my question. I should get in trouble.\u201d</p><p>Tony smiles at him. He already holds Ned in the highest regards just from the way Peter often talks about his best friend. He always has the other boy\u2019s back - it reminds him a lot of his and Rhodey\u2019s friendship.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate your loyalty to your friend, Ned but Peter didn\u2019t have to answer you.\u201d Ned is about to open his mouth again, no doubt to protect his friend further but is stopped by a quiet voice from the back. <br><br>\u201cNed, stop. It\u2019s alright.\u201d Peter has stood up and is making his way towards Tony\u2019s desk. He\u2019s careful not to let his eyes linger on the boy\u2019s hips and how they sway when navigates himself around the various desks. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>He watches as the friends face each other. \u201cYou sure? I don\u2019t want to get you in trouble, man.\u201d Peter shakes his head and walks over to Ned, putting a reassuring hand on his shoulder and slowly pushing him towards the door.<br><br>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s fine.\u201d, he promises and glances at Tony in a silent question for support. Far be it from him to leave Peter hanging. <br><br>\u201cYes, don\u2019t worry.\u201d, he explains calmly, doing his best to give him the stern teacher look. He usually is pretty good at that. Well, when he isn\u2019t distracted like he is right now. \u201cI just want to talk to him real quick.\u201d <br><br>Ned finally gives up and instead asks Peter if he should wait up for him outside. Tony forces down a laugh when he sees how the boy\u2019s eyes grow big at that in panic before he stutters out a reply. \u201cNo, no. It\u2019s okay.\u201d He grins at him. \u201cYou\u2019ll come over for dinner this evening though, right? May is making something special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it, man.\u201d They exchange their over-long and tedious handshake and then Ned finally walks out the door, closing it behind him - leaving Tony and Peter alone in the room. They both remain where they are for a heartbeat, Peter standing in front of his desk and Tony sitting behind it. <br><br>The moment passes and he uses his feet to slowly push himself and the chair back, laughing at the way Peter flinches. He hates when he does that but teasing the boy is just too much fun. \u201cIs something the matter, Peter?\u201d</p><p>Their eyes meet but no words are spoken. Peter just stares at him and Tony raises an eyebrow at his silence. Then, very quietly \u201cNo, Mister Stark. It\u2019s nothing.\u201d He marvels at the boys acting skills, he truly does. They are very impressive. <br><br>\u201cWell, I am still expecting an apology for disrupting my class.\u201d, he tells him matter of factly and gets up. His feet carry him to the door - his hand going for the doorknob. It clicks shut and locky easily. \u201cYou\u2019re doing that a bit too often in the last time.\u201d</p><p>He turns back, eyes darting to the spot Peter had been frozen too a second ago. He\u2019s not there anymore. Instead, the boy is sitting on the edge of the teacher\u2019s desk with his legs hanging down and slightly swaying. <br><br>Tony slowly starts approaching him, mouth twitching up. \u201cWell, well. What is this?\u201d His voice sounds rough, even to himself and it has the wanted effect as Peter lets out a little sound. To his credit, however, it\u2019s the only slip up he lets happen. <br><br>The boy\u2019s eyes grow big as he watches him. Tony comes to a halt in front of him, a good distance between them both. \u201cI-\u201d Peter\u2019s voice shakes a bit and he stumbles over his words. He needs to ask him later if he ever thought about making a career as an actor. \u201cI am really sorry about disrupting class, Mister Stark.\u201d<br><br>God, he loves it when Peter calls him that. Mister Stark. Especially with that voice. \u201cAre you truly?\u201d, Tony asks while taking a step closer. <br><br>\u201cYes!\u201d, he squeaks out quickly. \u201cI am truly sorry. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s gotten into me lately.\u201d His apology sounds sincere but the way his eyes sparkle and his hands excitedly tap against his expensive desk tell him otherwise. \u201cI really don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d, he hums softly while taking another step forward - and another one. He continues until Peter has to physically lean back to avoid being pressed against his chest - not that Tony doubts that that\u2019s what the boy actually wants.</p><p>But the charade isn\u2019t over just now. <br><br>He cocks his head to the side and watches his student. \u201cI think I know, though.\u201d He leans forward - his hands resting flat on the desk on both sides of Peter\u2019s body. The boy is trapped - the only way to get more space between them would be if he lied down on his back. <br><br>He doesn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cMister\u2026 Mister Stark? Sir?\u201d Tony can feel the boy\u2019s breath on his cheek and his eyes flutter shut for a moment. It\u2019s been a while since he had been so close to him. It\u2019s getting harder and harder to keep this up. \u201cI don\u2019t think I know what you mean. Sir.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s fingers curl around the edge of his desk, his nails digging into the wood. \u201cYou\u2019re on thin ice, Parker.\u201d, he hisses out between his teeth in an attempt to regain the upper hand but Peter smiles softly and his composure melts away.</p><p>He freezes - his body going completely stiff when he feels the faintest touch on the back of his hand. His eyes dart to the side to see Peter\u2019s slender fingers caressing his skin and he can\u2019t stop the loud breath that\u2019s leaving him at the contact. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, sir.\u201d, he says as if there\u2019s nothing else currently happening. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make things hard for you.\u201d</p><p>Oh, he\u2019s good. He\u2019s really, really good. Tony can\u2019t argue with that. He doesn\u2019t say anything, just keeps on watching his student and concentrates on the feel of skin against skin. Peter keeps on mumbling about stuff Tony just can\u2019t bother to listen anymore - too captivated by his pretty face.</p><p>\u201cCan I somehow make it up to you, Mister Stark? I really want to.\u201d His fingers dig into Tony\u2019s hand - \u201cI really do, sir.\u201d and he can\u2019t take anymore. <br><br>\u201cEnough.\u201d, he roughly says and whips forward to crash his mouth against Peter\u2019s. The boy lets out a strangled noise at that, clearly surprised at the abrupt action. Usually, they keep this facade up and running for a much longer but this week has been hell so far and he needs to forget it - even if it\u2019s just for a fleeting moment.</p><p>Peter, finally recovering from his brash attack on his mouth, lets his hands wander down Tony\u2019s neck to dig his hands into his back. It\u2019ll probably crumble his expensive suit jacket but he can\u2019t care less about that - not when the boy\u2019s fingers feel so good. <br><br>His own hands cup Peter\u2019s face, gently coaxing his lips apart with his tongue. He groans when the boy eagerly gives in and lets him invade his mouth - a satisfied sigh leaving his mouth as well. <br><br>Tony is forced to take a step closer so that his thighs are almost painfully pressed into the edge of his desk - all because Peter\u2019s own legs sneak themselves around his waist to pull him closer. <br><br>They continue tasting each other until Tony has to pull back, in desperate need for air. He takes deep breaths as the boy wrapped around him lets out a disappointed whine, trying to capture his lips again. The only thing that\u2019s stopping him is Tony\u2019s hands currently cupping his face.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d, he lets out between short and laboured breaths and Tony grins at the way his voice cracks. \u201cPlease, Mister Stark.\u201d, he tries again.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Pete.\u201d, he gently scolds him, his face dropping to Peter\u2019s neck to nuzzle into the soft skin there and taking in his scent. \u201cDrop that. We\u2019re all alone now.\u201d There is no reply but a quiet sigh - he\u2019s clearly enjoying Tony\u2019s attention. <br><br>And then - \u201cTony.\u201d He groans into his neck, hands wandering to Pete\u2019s waist and pulling him forward until he almost drops from the desk - anything to get him as close as possible. It can never be close enough. Not now, not ever.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d, he asks while nibbling at the spot right under his ear where he knows it will make the boy squeak and sure enough he lets out a high-pitched sound. \u201cThat\u2019s not a real request, is it, Pete?\u201d He gently bites down before swiping his tongue over the spot to make sure that no bruise will form there. <br><br>The last thing he needs right now is someone seeing one of his students leave his classroom with a hickey on his neck - as much as he hates the fact that he can\u2019t do that. <br><br>\u201cPlease, Tony.\u201d, Peter tries again, voice a bit steadier this time. \u201cMore.\u201d <br><br>\u201cMore?\u201d, he asks.</p><p>\u201cKissing. More kissing. Come on.\u201d He pulls Tony\u2019s face back to crash their lips together once more. He doesn\u2019t object and lets him take the lead for once as their tongues slide against each other. He missed tasting him this past week. <br><br>\u201cMissed you.. so much.\u201d, Peter mumbles between kisses as if he read Tony\u2019s mind. \u201cSo, so much.\u201d His hand dig themselves into his dark curls and a shiver runs down his spine. It feels so good to finally feel him again like this. <br><br>The glances he manages to sneak in during lessons just aren\u2019t enough. <br><br>\u201cI missed you, too.\u201d, he softly tells him. This time, Peter is the one to pull back but his hands keep his hair in a firm grip which is a bit hotter than it probably should be. He watches him intensely with an expression Tony can\u2019t really decipher. <br><br>That\u2019s odd. He is proud of the fact that he can read the boy\u2019s face like an open book most of the time even when he tries to hide his true feelings. This is mildly concerning. The closest thing he can read into it is\u2026 surprise, perhaps?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d, he asks, doing his best to sound casual and to swallow the lump that is starting to form in his throat. \u201cDid I do something?\u201d Peter shakes his head and it eases his worries - a bit. <br><br>\u201cNo, no. It\u2019s just -\u201d He blinks at him a few times. \u201cYou missed me, too?\u201d This time the surprise in his voice is unmistakable. Tony frowns at him, utterly confused.<br><br>\u201cOf course I did. We haven\u2019t been -\u201d He pauses for a second, not sure how to continue. \u201clike this since last week. Why wouldn\u2019t I miss you?\u201d The hands in his hair start to gently massage his scalp and it takes every ounce of his willpower not to lose focus of the conversation.</p><p>Peter is good at making him lose focus, has been since day one.</p><p>\u201cWell, you see\u2026\u201d He cuts himself off again, his head dropping down but Tony catches it and brings his eyes back to his. Peter nervously hums and he swipes his thumbs over his cheeks to ease the worry behind his eyes. <br><br>\u201cTell me, Pete.\u201d, he pleads.</p><p>\u201cI just thought that - like it\u2019s obvious that I like you. You know, a lot.\u201d Tony\u2019s heart flutters. \u201cBut I always thought that you.. uhm. You\u2019re much older and obviously looking for something else in the long run so I -\u201d<br><br>He stares at him in horror, shock and slight disgust - mostly at himself. \u201cYou think\u2026 that I am just playing with you?\u201d He lets out a shuddering breath. \u201cThat I am with you as some sick sort of pastime?\u201d</p><p>He can\u2019t believe that Peter can even think something like that. Is that really the picture he is painting with his actions? He is pretty sure he is going to be sick. He staggers back but Peter still has his legs wrapped around him and keeps him mostly in place. \u201cIs that what I am making you think?\u201d<br><br>\u201cNo! No, you don\u2019t!\u201d, he tries to soothe him in a panicked voice but the damage is done.</p><p>\u201cWell, I obviously do if that\u2019s what you think of me!\u201d He attempts once again to free himself from Peter\u2019s grip but the boy clings to him like he\u2019s his lifeline and perhaps, deep down, he is. \u201cPete-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d His voice is loud and there is this underlying fear inside Tony that someone outside might hear them. \u201cI am sorry I said that. I should have kept it to myself. It\u2019s stupid, really.\u201d Now, it\u2019s Tony\u2019s turn to shake his head. <br><br>\u201cNo, I\u2019m glad you said it. That gives me the opportunity to tell you how utterly wrong you are, Pete.\u201d The boy\u2019s eyes almost pop out of his sockets at those words and his mouth opens - no doubt to say something against it. Tony is quicker.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t just some fling for me to enjoy and then toss aside when I don\u2019t longer want it.\u201d, he explains, eyes locking with Peter\u2019s. \u201cI don\u2019t know where you got that idea from - I really don\u2019t but the fact that that\u2019s the way you think about this shows me that I have to try harder.\u201d</p><p>The boy doesn\u2019t say anything, his mouth still opened and Tony uses his index finger to softly close it. \u201cYou mean a lot to me, Pete. A lot. I hope I can somehow make you understand that.\u201d</p><p>They both stand there in silence until Peter lets out a quiet laugh which makes Tony frown. \u201cI really thought you\u2019d tell me that I am in way over my head. Since I\u2019m 17 and all - still have my whole life to figure out and shouldn\u2019t act like this.\u201d <br><br>\u201cI would never do that, Pete. Just because you are young and somewhat inexperienced doesn\u2019t mean that your feelings aren\u2019t as valid as my own.\u201d He\u2019s not good at things like this - talking about these topics but he\u2019s willing to try his best for Peter. It\u2019s what he deserves.</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d His heart aches as soon as he hears how tiny and broken Peter\u2019s voice is. \u201cI.. I don\u2019t know what to say. I never imagine that you actually-\u201d Tony breaks him off before he can start his rambling again.</p><p>\u201cI do. Believe me, I do.\u201d He doesn\u2019t know what else to say - can\u2019t think of more words that can convince Peter that he already owns his heart. Maybe, this is wrong. He\u2019s still a minor - barely but still but he can\u2019t help himself. <br><br>So, he does the one thing he knows he\u2019s good at - the best way he knows how to express his feelings.<br><br>He kisses Peter again, silently praying that he gets the message. Judging by the way he responds, eagerly and with so much passion - Tony can almost believe that he does. Almost. Perhaps, that is enough for now.<br></p>",

It&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo; He grins at him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll come over for dinner this evening though, right? May is making something special.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You got it, man.&rdquo; They exchange their over-long and tedious handshake and then Ned finally walks out the door, closing it behind him - leaving Tony and Peter alone in the room. They both remain where they are for a heartbeat, Peter standing in front of his desk and Tony sitting behind it. <br /><br />The moment passes and he uses his feet to slowly push himself and the chair back, laughing at the way Peter flinches. He hates when he does that but teasing the boy is just too much fun. &ldquo;Is something the matter, Peter?&rdquo;</p><p>Their eyes meet but no words are spoken. Peter just stares at him and Tony raises an eyebrow at his silence. Then, very quietly &ldquo;No, Mister Stark. It&rsquo;s nothing.&rdquo; He marvels at the boys acting skills, he truly does. They are very impressive. <br /><br />&ldquo;Well, I am still expecting an apology for disrupting my class.&rdquo;, he tells him matter of factly and gets up. His feet carry him to the door - his hand going for the doorknob. It clicks shut and locky easily. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing that a bit too often in the last time.&rdquo;</p><p>He turns back, eyes darting to the spot Peter had been frozen too a second ago. He&rsquo;s not there anymore. Instead, the boy is sitting on the edge of the teacher&rsquo;s desk with his legs hanging down and slightly swaying. <br /><br />Tony slowly starts approaching him, mouth twitching up. &ldquo;Well, well. What is this?&rdquo; His voice sounds rough, even to himself and it has the wanted effect as Peter lets out a little sound. To his credit, however, it&rsquo;s the only slip up he lets happen. <br /><br />The boy&rsquo;s eyes grow big as he watches him. Tony comes to a halt in front of him, a good distance between them both. &ldquo;I-&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s voice shakes a bit and he stumbles over his words. He needs to ask him later if he ever thought about making a career as an actor. &ldquo;I am really sorry about disrupting class, Mister Stark.&rdquo;<br /><br />God, he loves it when Peter calls him that. Mister Stark. Especially with that voice. &ldquo;Are you truly?&rdquo;, Tony asks while taking a step closer. <br /><br />&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;, he squeaks out quickly. &ldquo;I am truly sorry. I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s gotten into me lately.&rdquo; His apology sounds sincere but the way his eyes sparkle and his hands excitedly tap against his expensive desk tell him otherwise. &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hm.&rdquo;, he hums softly while taking another step forward - and another one. He continues until Peter has to physically lean back to avoid being pressed against his chest - not that Tony doubts that that&rsquo;s what the boy actually wants.</p><p>But the charade isn&rsquo;t over just now. <br /><br />He cocks his head to the side and watches his student. &ldquo;I think I know, though.&rdquo; He leans forward - his hands resting flat on the desk on both sides of Peter&rsquo;s body. The boy is trapped - the only way to get more space between them would be if he lied down on his back. <br /><br />He doesn&rsquo;t.</p><p>&ldquo;Mister&hellip; Mister Stark? Sir?&rdquo; Tony can feel the boy&rsquo;s breath on his cheek and his eyes flutter shut for a moment. It&rsquo;s been a while since he had been so close to him. It&rsquo;s getting harder and harder to keep this up. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I know what you mean. Sir.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s fingers curl around the edge of his desk, his nails digging into the wood. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re on thin ice, Parker.&rdquo;, he hisses out between his teeth in an attempt to regain the upper hand but Peter smiles softly and his composure melts away.</p><p>He freezes - his body going completely stiff when he feels the faintest touch on the back of his hand. His eyes dart to the side to see Peter&rsquo;s slender fingers caressing his skin and he can&rsquo;t stop the loud breath that&rsquo;s leaving him at the contact. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really sorry, sir.&rdquo;, he says as if there&rsquo;s nothing else currently happening. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to make things hard for you.&rdquo;</p><p>Oh, he&rsquo;s good. He&rsquo;s really, really good. Tony can&rsquo;t argue with that. He doesn&rsquo;t say anything, just keeps on watching his student and concentrates on the feel of skin against skin. Peter keeps on mumbling about stuff Tony just can&rsquo;t bother to listen anymore - too captivated by his pretty face.</p><p>&ldquo;Can I somehow make it up to you, Mister Stark? I really want to.&rdquo; His fingers dig into Tony&rsquo;s hand - &ldquo;I really do, sir.&rdquo; and he can&rsquo;t take anymore. <br /><br />&ldquo;Enough.&rdquo;, he roughly says and whips forward to crash his mouth against Peter&rsquo;s. The boy lets out a strangled noise at that, clearly surprised at the abrupt action. Usually, they keep this facade up and running for a much longer but this week has been hell so far and he needs to forget it - even if it&rsquo;s just for a fleeting moment.</p><p>Peter, finally recovering from his brash attack on his mouth, lets his hands wander down Tony&rsquo;s neck to dig his hands into his back. It&rsquo;ll probably crumble his expensive suit jacket but he can&rsquo;t care less about that - not when the boy&rsquo;s fingers feel so good. <br /><br />His own hands cup Peter&rsquo;s face, gently coaxing his lips apart with his tongue. He groans when the boy eagerly gives in and lets him invade his mouth - a satisfied sigh leaving his mouth as well. <br /><br />Tony is forced to take a step closer so that his thighs are almost painfully pressed into the edge of his desk - all because Peter&rsquo;s own legs sneak themselves around his waist to pull him closer. <br /><br />They continue tasting each other until Tony has to pull back, in desperate need for air. He takes deep breaths as the boy wrapped around him lets out a disappointed whine, trying to capture his lips again. The only thing that&rsquo;s stopping him is Tony&rsquo;s hands currently cupping his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Please.&rdquo;, he lets out between short and laboured breaths and Tony grins at the way his voice cracks. &ldquo;Please, Mister Stark.&rdquo;, he tries again.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, Pete.&rdquo;, he gently scolds him, his face dropping to Peter&rsquo;s neck to nuzzle into the soft skin there and taking in his scent. &ldquo;Drop that. We&rsquo;re all alone now.&rdquo; There is no reply but a quiet sigh - he&rsquo;s clearly enjoying Tony&rsquo;s attention. <br /><br />And then - &ldquo;Tony.&rdquo; He groans into his neck, hands wandering to Pete&rsquo;s waist and pulling him forward until he almost drops from the desk - anything to get him as close as possible. It can never be close enough. Not now, not ever.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;, he asks while nibbling at the spot right under his ear where he knows it will make the boy squeak and sure enough he lets out a high-pitched sound. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a real request, is it, Pete?&rdquo; He gently bites down before swiping his tongue over the spot to make sure that no bruise will form there. <br /><br />The last thing he needs right now is someone seeing one of his students leave his classroom with a hickey on his neck - as much as he hates the fact that he can&rsquo;t do that. <br /><br />&ldquo;Please, Tony.&rdquo;, Peter tries again, voice a bit steadier this time. &ldquo;More.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;More?&rdquo;, he asks.</p><p>&ldquo;Kissing. More kissing. Come on.&rdquo; He pulls Tony&rsquo;s face back to crash their lips together once more. He doesn&rsquo;t object and lets him take the lead for once as their tongues slide against each other. He missed tasting him this past week. <br /><br />&ldquo;Missed you.. so much.&rdquo;, Peter mumbles between kisses as if he read Tony&rsquo;s mind. &ldquo;So, so much.&rdquo; His hand dig themselves into his dark curls and a shiver runs down his spine. It feels so good to finally feel him again like this. <br /><br />The glances he manages to sneak in during lessons just aren&rsquo;t enough. <br /><br />&ldquo;I missed you, too.&rdquo;, he softly tells him. This time, Peter is the one to pull back but his hands keep his hair in a firm grip which is a bit hotter than it probably should be. He watches him intensely with an expression Tony can&rsquo;t really decipher. <br /><br />That&rsquo;s odd. He is proud of the fact that he can read the boy&rsquo;s face like an open book most of the time even when he tries to hide his true feelings. This is mildly concerning. The closest thing he can read into it is&hellip; surprise, perhaps?</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;, he asks, doing his best to sound casual and to swallow the lump that is starting to form in his throat. &ldquo;Did I do something?&rdquo; Peter shakes his head and it eases his worries - a bit. <br /><br />&ldquo;No, no. It&rsquo;s just -&rdquo; He blinks at him a few times. &ldquo;You missed me, too?&rdquo; This time the surprise in his voice is unmistakable. Tony frowns at him, utterly confused.<br /><br />&ldquo;Of course I did. We haven&rsquo;t been -&rdquo; He pauses for a second, not sure how to continue. &ldquo;like this since last week. Why wouldn&rsquo;t I miss you?&rdquo; The hands in his hair start to gently massage his scalp and it takes every ounce of his willpower not to lose focus of the conversation.</p><p>Peter is good at making him lose focus, has been since day one.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you see&hellip;&rdquo; He cuts himself off again, his head dropping down but Tony catches it and brings his eyes back to his. Peter nervously hums and he swipes his thumbs over his cheeks to ease the worry behind his eyes. <br /><br />&ldquo;Tell me, Pete.&rdquo;, he pleads.</p><p>&ldquo;I just thought that - like it&rsquo;s obvious that I like you. You know, a lot.&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s heart flutters. &ldquo;But I always thought that you.. uhm. You&rsquo;re much older and obviously looking for something else in the long run so I -&rdquo;<br /><br />He stares at him in horror, shock and slight disgust - mostly at himself. &ldquo;You think&hellip; that I am just playing with you?&rdquo; He lets out a shuddering breath. &ldquo;That I am with you as some sick sort of pastime?&rdquo;</p><p>He can&rsquo;t believe that Peter can even think something like that. Is that really the picture he is painting with his actions? He is pretty sure he is going to be sick. He staggers back but Peter still has his legs wrapped around him and keeps him mostly in place. &ldquo;Is that what I am making you think?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;No! No, you don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;, he tries to soothe him in a panicked voice but the damage is done.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I obviously do if that&rsquo;s what you think of me!&rdquo; He attempts once again to free himself from Peter&rsquo;s grip but the boy clings to him like he&rsquo;s his lifeline and perhaps, deep down, he is. &ldquo;Pete-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; His voice is loud and there is this underlying fear inside Tony that someone outside might hear them. &ldquo;I am sorry I said that. I should have kept it to myself. It&rsquo;s stupid, really.&rdquo; Now, it&rsquo;s Tony&rsquo;s turn to shake his head. <br /><br />&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m glad you said it. That gives me the opportunity to tell you how utterly wrong you are, Pete.&rdquo; The boy&rsquo;s eyes almost pop out of his sockets at those words and his mouth opens - no doubt to say something against it. Tony is quicker.</p><p>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t just some fling for me to enjoy and then toss aside when I don&rsquo;t longer want it.&rdquo;, he explains, eyes locking with Peter&rsquo;s. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where you got that idea from - I really don&rsquo;t but the fact that that&rsquo;s the way you think about this shows me that I have to try harder.&rdquo;</p><p>The boy doesn&rsquo;t say anything, his mouth still opened and Tony uses his index finger to softly close it. &ldquo;You mean a lot to me, Pete. A lot. I hope I can somehow make you understand that.&rdquo;</p><p>They both stand there in silence until Peter lets out a quiet laugh which makes Tony frown. &ldquo;I really thought you&rsquo;d tell me that I am in way over my head. Since I&rsquo;m 17 and all - still have my whole life to figure out and shouldn&rsquo;t act like this.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;I would never do that, Pete. Just because you are young and somewhat inexperienced doesn&rsquo;t mean that your feelings aren&rsquo;t as valid as my own.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s not good at things like this - talking about these topics but he&rsquo;s willing to try his best for Peter. It&rsquo;s what he deserves.</p><p>&ldquo;Wow.&rdquo; His heart aches as soon as he hears how tiny and broken Peter&rsquo;s voice is. &ldquo;I.. I don&rsquo;t know what to say. I never imagine that you actually-&rdquo; Tony breaks him off before he can start his rambling again.</p><p>&ldquo;I do. Believe me, I do.&rdquo; He doesn&rsquo;t know what else to say - can&rsquo;t think of more words that can convince Peter that he already owns his heart. Maybe, this is wrong. He&rsquo;s still a minor - barely but still but he can&rsquo;t help himself. <br /><br />So, he does the one thing he knows he&rsquo;s good at - the best way he knows how to express his feelings.<br /><br />He kisses Peter again, silently praying that he gets the message. Judging by the way he responds, eagerly and with so much passion - Tony can almost believe that he does. Almost. Perhaps, that is enough for now.<br /></p>",
