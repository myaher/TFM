Then... a lot of confusion and explanation. (Sorry it's short and kinda cliche)",
        "answer": "<p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'>Oh yeah I love this ideaa again I changed some parts a bit but I hope it&rsquo;s okay! </p><p>~~~~~</p><p>&ldquo;Hey there Underdog,&rdquo; TJ said with a smirk, as he saw Cyrus walk up to where he was standing under the streelight. Cyrus smiled, tugging on the hoodie he was wearing as he jogged up to him, cupping TJ&rsquo;s cheeks and pulling him in for a kiss. </p><p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this too late for a movie?&rdquo; Cyrus said with a smile. TJ laughed, bumping his nose with Cyrus&rsquo;. </p><p>&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus laughed, interlocking his fingers with TJ&rsquo;s. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s the only time we can go on a date.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ sighed, nodding his head. Cyrus noticed his drop in expression and placed a hand on his cheek. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, I know. Even I don&rsquo;t wanna sneak around anymore but, you and I both know Buffy and Andi are still not completely cool with you. I mean they&rsquo;re cool but they always talk about how I shouldn&rsquo;t have forgiven you so easily for the Costume Day thing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know, Cy,&rdquo; TJ said, leaning his forehead against Cyrus&rsquo;. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t expect them to be cool with me. And on that note,&rdquo; He said, pulling away from Cyrus a bit. &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have forgiven me either.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; Cyrus said, pulling him back. &ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t starting this again. You and I both know what happened, and I don&rsquo;t believe you when you say I shouldn&rsquo;t have forgiven you.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ gave a small smile as Cyrus kissed his cheek. He laughed a bit. </p><p>&ldquo;At least one good thing came of this,&rdquo; He said, looking down at their interwoven fingers. &ldquo;Now what say we go catch that movie?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus smiled and nodded, leaning in for one more kiss before linking his arm with TJ&rsquo;s and walking ahead. They got their tickets and walked into the theatre, the movie not having begun yet. TJ turned to Cyrus, who had already made himself at home in his seat. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna get us popcorn and soda, okay?&rdquo; TJ whispered, squeezing Cyrus&rsquo; hand and getting up. He headed over to get popcorn but stopped short when he saw the person at the counter. </p><p>&ldquo;Amber?!&rdquo; TJ yelled, and the blonde haired girl who was texting on her phone looked up and her eyes went wide. </p><p>&ldquo;TJ?!&rdquo; She exclaimed, dropping her phone in the commotion. </p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; TJ asked incredulously, walking over to her. </p><p>&ldquo;I took a job at the theatre just for a while to cover the layover at the Spoon,&rdquo; Amber said, shock still evident in her voice. &ldquo;What are YOU doing here? At this time?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I, uh,&rdquo; TJ fumbled, trying to figure out how to not expose him and Cyrus&rsquo; relationship. &ldquo;I got bored, so I snuck out to see a movie.&rdquo;</p><p>Amber narrowed her eyes, disbelief clouding her face. TJ just sighed, rolling his eyes. &ldquo;Can you just give me a buttered popcorn and a soda? Thanks,&rdquo; He said, throwing his money on the counter as Amber huffed and gave him his things. As he walked away, her mind was racing. </p><p><i>Why was TJ here? Was he actually alone? If not&hellip; </i></p><p><i>Who was he with? </i></p><p>Before she could think any further, her phone chimed and she opened the message, beaming. </p><p><b>Andi: im omw to the theatre now wait for me xx </b></p><p>TJ headed back to his seat, smiling softly as he handed Cyrus the popcorn.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, you took so long. I got worried&rdquo; Cyrus whispered, as the lights dimmed, indicating the movie beginning. </p><p>TJ took a minute to think about whether he should tell Cyrus about who he saw working, but then decided against it, deeming it not important, as he leaned down to kiss his forehead. </p><p>&ldquo;Just a line, babe. Let&rsquo;s enjoy the movie now.&rdquo;</p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;And one cherry soda for the Slayer herself,&rdquo; Marty said, as he sat down beside Buffy handing her the bottle. She smiled gleefully, taking a sip and instantly leaning back with a sigh. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god, whoever invented chilled drinks, i&rsquo;m free Thursday,&rdquo; She said, smiling at Marty raising his eyebrows. </p><p>&ldquo;Buffy it is Thursday.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t have to be this Thursday,&rdquo; She said with a wink. Marty just laughed, clinking his cola bottle with hers. </p><p>&ldquo;Cheers to us, just a couple of not-just-friends on a not-date,&rdquo; Marty said, causing Buffy to almost sit out her drink. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is it, Buffy?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You used the word!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What, date?&rdquo; Marty asked, Buffy just shoving him by the shoulder. &ldquo;Fine, on a not-platonic-outing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; She said, sinking into her seat. </p><p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you worried about meeting your friends here?&rdquo; He asked, furrowing his eyebrows. Buffy just shrugged. </p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus wouldn&rsquo;t sneak out of the house and Andi has her parents there. We&rsquo;ll be fine. We won&rsquo;t see anyone we know.&rdquo;</p><p>Marty just nodded, turning to see the movie, the two of them keenly aware of the lack of distance between their hands. </p><p>*</p><p>As the credits of the movie began to roll, TJ looked down at his shoulder where Cyrus&rsquo; head was, him clutching onto his arm and snuggling up to TJ. TJ&rsquo;s arm was around Cyrus&rsquo; shoukders, and honestly, neither wanted to move. But Cyrus finally pried himself away from TJ. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just gonna go to the bathroom, okay? We can leave after 5 minutes, he whispered, leaning over to kiss TJ before he got up. </p><p>As he headed over to the bathroom, he saw out of the corner of his eye an attendant and another girl laughing and standing really close together, but he paid no attention, drowsiness taking over his whole system. He went into the bathroom and splashed water on his face, trying to keep himself at peak alertness to sneak back home. He smiled to himself, thinking about how the night had gone, the perfect date he had just had with TJ. It did suck that they had to sneak around for the past month, but he wouldn&rsquo;t trade the quiet moments he got with TJ for anything. Wiping his face, he walked out of the bathroom, going back to the theatre to meet TJ. However, as he was leaving, he barreled right into a girl walking out of the other washroom. </p><p>&rdquo; Oh my god I&rsquo;m so sorry,&ldquo; The two said simultaneously, but when Cyrus looked up he stopped short. </p><p>Buffy. </p><p>&quot;Cyrus?! What are you doing here?&rdquo; Buffy yelled, her eyes wide. </p><p>&ldquo;I could ask you the same thing!&rdquo; Cyrus replied, stepping back in shock. </p><p>&ldquo;Um, I, uh,&rdquo; Buffy started, mumbling. &ldquo;I came to get popcorn!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But the movie is over?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe I just want more popcorn,&rdquo; Buffy said, walking up to the counter, her eyes fixed on Cyrus, who was now following her. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey can i get a- OH MY GOD,&rdquo; Buffy exclaimed, and Cyrus saw the two girls from before jump away from each other, flustered, as if they were about to kiss but had been interrupted. Cyrus shook his head, wondering why on earth Buffy would be so scandalised until he saw who it was. And he and Buffy looked at each other before yelling. </p><p>&ldquo;Andi?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus! Buffy!&rdquo; Andi yelled, moving away from Amber and nearly tripping over the counter in the process. She lesned on it as casually as she could, hand in her hip. &ldquo;What are you guys doing here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing almost kissing Amber Kippen?!&rdquo; Buffy said, pointing at Amber who was standing very awkwardly to the corner. She then turned back to Cyrus. &ldquo;And you still haven&rsquo;t answered my question!&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus was about to try and come up with an excuse when he noticed a figure walking up from behind Buffy. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey Cy, you were taking a bit of time. Need me to drop you home, in typical date night fashion?&rdquo; TJ asked as he walked up, not noticing Cyrus motioning to stop talking until it was too late. The girl who stood in front of Cyrus turned around and TJ stopped short when he saw Buffy&rsquo;s confused and annoyed face staring back at him. </p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean, &lsquo;date&rsquo;?&rdquo; She asked quietly, narrowing her eyes. </p><p>TJ turned to Amber who was currently finding the floor very fascinating, and he looked down. He cleared his throat. </p><p>&ldquo;Amber, why are you holding Andi&rsquo;s hand?&rdquo; He asked, making them drop their hands away, Amber pushing a strand of hair behind her ear and Andi scratching her hand. Andi looked curiously between TJ and Cyrus and the puzzle pieces clicked. </p><p>&ldquo;You guys are dating?&rdquo; She asked, looking between TJ and Cyrus. Before Buffy could make any remark, Marty walked into the lobby. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey Driscoll, what happened? You were late and,&rdquo; He trailed off, seeing all the people around the room. </p><p>Cyrus narrowed his eyes. &ldquo;Wait, you guys are here together?&rdquo;</p><p>An awkward silence fell among the group, everyone eyeing each other up in confusion and shock. Eventually, Amber reached down and put a cherry cola on the counter with a straw. </p><p>&ldquo;Cola anyone?&rdquo;</p><p>*</p><p>Cyrus walked down to the Spoon, his feet dragging behind him. It had been more than a day since the theatre incident, as his brain was calling it. He hadnt spoken or texted Andi or Buffy in all that time, and he didn&rsquo;t even know why. This should have just been a funny one-off where they all laughed about what had happened, but for some reason they were all confused and hurt. He had talked to TJ for hours on FaceTime, where TJ tried reassuring him that everything was okay, but Cyrus wasn&rsquo;t so sure. For some reason, this felt big. </p><p>He pushed open the doors of the Spoon, scanning the place to look for TJ, but he hadnt come yet. Cyrus sighed and sat down in a booth, taking out his phone. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; TJ said as he approached, and Cyrus smiled as TJ slid into the seat beside him. </p><p>&ldquo;Why did you want to meet?&rdquo; Cyrus asked curiously, unsure of what TJ wanted. Before TJ could say anything, the door chimed open and Marty and Buffy walked in and Marty draged Buffy to the booth where TJ and Cyrus were, sitting in front of them. Cyrus looked up at Buffy and immediately looked down, Buffy doing the same. Marty and TJ sighed. </p><p>As if on cue, Amber walked in, dragging Andi by the hand and pulled up two chairs, sitting at their table. A silence fell over them, everyone unsure of who was going to start talking. Eventually, Amber spoke. </p><p>&ldquo;You guys need to talk,&rdquo; she said, looking at the group. &ldquo;Marty, TJ and I spoke and all three of you are driving your respective people insane by your worrying, so you need to talk.&rdquo;</p><p>Andi sighed, leanign forward. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. We do. Because, one thing none of us ever like doing is keep secrets from each other.&rdquo; Cyrus gave a small smile at that, and Buffy sighed. </p><p>Cyrus took a deep breath, looking at TJ questioningly before starting. &ldquo;TJ and I were in a date. We&rsquo;ve been together for a month now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you just tell us?&rdquo; Buffy asked, furrowing her eyebrows. </p><p>Cyrus just shrugged. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how you guys would react. You guys keep talking about how I shouldn&rsquo;t have forgiven him, but I couldn&rsquo;t tell you why I did. Because that would involve me telling you TJ&rsquo;s reason. And that wasn&rsquo;t my place.&rdquo;</p><p>Andi looked at TJ. &ldquo;Your reason for doing the costume with Kira?&rdquo; </p><p>TJ nodded hesitantly. &ldquo;She found out about me liking Cyrus. Apparently, I wasn&rsquo;t as subtle as I thought. And she kinda, used it against me,&rdquo; He said in a quiet voice. &ldquo;I agree with you, Cyrus really shouldn&rsquo;t have&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No you&rsquo;re wrong,&rdquo; Buffy said, reaching across to squeeze TJ&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;TJ we had no idea. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; he said with a smile. Cyrus reached over and interlocked their fingers. </p><p>&ldquo;I just didn&rsquo;t know how to tell yoy. So we kept it a secret. I&rsquo;m sorry, I should&rsquo;ve told you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay Cy,&rdquo; Buffy said, shaking her head. </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re sorry for making you think you couldn&rsquo;t tell us,&rdquo; Andi said, reaching to hold Cyrus&rsquo; hand. </p><p>Cyrus smiled, turning to Andi. &ldquo;What about you?&rdquo;</p><p>Andi held her breath, moving her hand to hold Amber&rsquo;s, who was nodding encouragingly. &ldquo;I may have just realised that I&rsquo;m not straight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Andi,&rdquo; Cyrus said softly, smiling at her. Buffy, who was sitting next to her, pulled her in for a hug. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, and I figured out that I liked Amber,&rdquo; She continued, smiling at Amber. &ldquo;And somehow, she liked me too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bambi, how could I not like you,&rdquo; Amber said, lenaing in to kiss Andi&rsquo;s cheek. &ldquo;But we are still fuguring it out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really happy for you guys,&rdquo; TJ said, smiling as he gave his sister a fist bump. </p><p>Andi laughed, turning to cup Amber&rsquo;s cheek and kiss her. To the background score of the group going &ldquo;Ooooooh&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo; Wait wait wait,&rdquo; Cyrus said after everyone had calmed down. &ldquo;We still don&rsquo;t know about Buffy. Marty was with you at the theater.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Andi said, leaning in. &ldquo;Were you two on a-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nah guys it&rsquo;s just two not-friends on a not-platonic-outing,&rdquo; Marty said, cutting Andi off. The others looked incredibly confused and unconvinced. </p><p>&ldquo;A not-platonic-outing? Seriously?&rdquo; TJ asked, deadpanned. </p><p>&ldquo;Hets are incredibly confusing,&rdquo; Amber mumbled, earning a high-five from Cyrus. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s what it was,&rdquo; Marty said, turning to flash a quick smile at Buffy. Buffy looked at Marty, and made up her mind. She grabbed Marty&rsquo;s hand, much to his surprise. </p><p>&ldquo;Actually, we were on a date. Like our second one,&rdquo; she said with a smile. </p><p>Marty looked over at her in surprise, a smile on his face. &ldquo;You said the word,&rdquo; He said softly. </p><p>&ldquo;Call it like it is, right?&rdquo; She said, leaning against him with a smile. </p><p>&ldquo;So, everything is out in the open now?&rdquo; Andi asked, and everyone nodded, smiling and laughing. </p><p>&ldquo;This seemed like the best moment to clink glasses, but we have none,&rdquo; Marty said, causing Buffy to shove him in the shoulder as the others laughed. </p><p>A couple moments later, Jonah walked in with his characteristic smile and pulled up a chair. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey guys,&rdquo; He said with a smile, everyone at the table suddenly aware that Jonah did not know what had just happened. </p><p>&ldquo;So, what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p><p>~~~~</p><p><i>Hope you like it! </i></p><p><b><a href=\"https://green-lemonboys.tumblr.com/post/184971730799/so-i-am-extremely-uninspired-lol\">Send me prompts and I&rsquo;ll do them in a few days! </a></b></p>",

Cyrus smiled, tugging on the hoodie he was wearing as he jogged up to him, cupping TJ\u2019s cheeks and pulling him in for a kiss. </p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this too late for a movie?\u201d Cyrus said with a smile. TJ laughed, bumping his nose with Cyrus\u2019. </p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus laughed, interlocking his fingers with TJ\u2019s. \u201cBut it\u2019s the only time we can go on a date.\u201d</p><p>TJ sighed, nodding his head. Cyrus noticed his drop in expression and placed a hand on his cheek. </p><p>\u201cHey, I know. Even I don\u2019t wanna sneak around anymore but, you and I both know Buffy and Andi are still not completely cool with you. I mean they\u2019re cool but they always talk about how I shouldn\u2019t have forgiven you so easily for the Costume Day thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Cy,\u201d TJ said, leaning his forehead against Cyrus\u2019. \u201cI don\u2019t expect them to be cool with me. And on that note,\u201d He said, pulling away from Cyrus a bit. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have forgiven me either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Cyrus said, pulling him back. \u201cWe aren\u2019t starting this again. You and I both know what happened, and I don\u2019t believe you when you say I shouldn\u2019t have forgiven you.\u201d</p><p>TJ gave a small smile as Cyrus kissed his cheek. He laughed a bit. </p><p>\u201cAt least one good thing came of this,\u201d He said, looking down at their interwoven fingers. \u201cNow what say we go catch that movie?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus smiled and nodded, leaning in for one more kiss before linking his arm with TJ\u2019s and walking ahead. They got their tickets and walked into the theatre, the movie not having begun yet. TJ turned to Cyrus, who had already made himself at home in his seat. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna get us popcorn and soda, okay?\u201d TJ whispered, squeezing Cyrus\u2019 hand and getting up. He headed over to get popcorn but stopped short when he saw the person at the counter. </p><p>\u201cAmber?!\u201d TJ yelled, and the blonde haired girl who was texting on her phone looked up and her eyes went wide. </p><p>\u201cTJ?!\u201d She exclaimed, dropping her phone in the commotion. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d TJ asked incredulously, walking over to her. </p><p>\u201cI took a job at the theatre just for a while to cover the layover at the Spoon,\u201d Amber said, shock still evident in her voice. \u201cWhat are YOU doing here? At this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, uh,\u201d TJ fumbled, trying to figure out how to not expose him and Cyrus\u2019 relationship. \u201cI got bored, so I snuck out to see a movie.\u201d</p><p>Amber narrowed her eyes, disbelief clouding her face. TJ just sighed, rolling his eyes. \u201cCan you just give me a buttered popcorn and a soda? Thanks,\u201d He said, throwing his money on the counter as Amber huffed and gave him his things. As he walked away, her mind was racing. </p><p><i>Why was TJ here? Was he actually alone? If not\u2026 </i></p><p><i>Who was he with? </i></p><p>Before she could think any further, her phone chimed and she opened the message, beaming. </p><p><b>Andi: im omw to the theatre now wait for me xx </b></p><p>TJ headed back to his seat, smiling softly as he handed Cyrus the popcorn.</p><p>\u201cHey, you took so long. I got worried\u201d Cyrus whispered, as the lights dimmed, indicating the movie beginning. </p><p>TJ took a minute to think about whether he should tell Cyrus about who he saw working, but then decided against it, deeming it not important, as he leaned down to kiss his forehead. </p><p>\u201cJust a line, babe. Let\u2019s enjoy the movie now.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cAnd one cherry soda for the Slayer herself,\u201d Marty said, as he sat down beside Buffy handing her the bottle. She smiled gleefully, taking a sip and instantly leaning back with a sigh. </p><p>\u201cOh my god, whoever invented chilled drinks, i\u2019m free Thursday,\u201d She said, smiling at Marty raising his eyebrows. </p><p>\u201cBuffy it is Thursday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t have to be this Thursday,\u201d She said with a wink. Marty just laughed, clinking his cola bottle with hers. </p><p>\u201cCheers to us, just a couple of not-just-friends on a not-date,\u201d Marty said, causing Buffy to almost sit out her drink. </p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Buffy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou used the word!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, date?\u201d Marty asked, Buffy just shoving him by the shoulder. \u201cFine, on a not-platonic-outing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d She said, sinking into her seat. </p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you worried about meeting your friends here?\u201d He asked, furrowing his eyebrows. Buffy just shrugged. </p><p>\u201cCyrus wouldn\u2019t sneak out of the house and Andi has her parents there. We\u2019ll be fine. We won\u2019t see anyone we know.\u201d</p><p>Marty just nodded, turning to see the movie, the two of them keenly aware of the lack of distance between their hands. </p><p>*</p><p>As the credits of the movie began to roll, TJ looked down at his shoulder where Cyrus\u2019 head was, him clutching onto his arm and snuggling up to TJ. TJ\u2019s arm was around Cyrus\u2019 shoukders, and honestly, neither wanted to move. But Cyrus finally pried himself away from TJ. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just gonna go to the bathroom, okay? We can leave after 5 minutes, he whispered, leaning over to kiss TJ before he got up. </p><p>As he headed over to the bathroom, he saw out of the corner of his eye an attendant and another girl laughing and standing really close together, but he paid no attention, drowsiness taking over his whole system. He went into the bathroom and splashed water on his face, trying to keep himself at peak alertness to sneak back home. He smiled to himself, thinking about how the night had gone, the perfect date he had just had with TJ. It did suck that they had to sneak around for the past month, but he wouldn\u2019t trade the quiet moments he got with TJ for anything. Wiping his face, he walked out of the bathroom, going back to the theatre to meet TJ. However, as he was leaving, he barreled right into a girl walking out of the other washroom. </p><p>\u201d Oh my god I\u2019m so sorry,\u201c The two said simultaneously, but when Cyrus looked up he stopped short. </p><p>Buffy. </p><p>\"Cyrus?!

Cyrus smiled, tugging on the hoodie he was wearing as he jogged up to him, cupping TJ\u2019s cheeks and pulling him in for a kiss. </p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this too late for a movie?\u201d Cyrus said with a smile. TJ laughed, bumping his nose with Cyrus\u2019. </p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus laughed, interlocking his fingers with TJ\u2019s. \u201cBut it\u2019s the only time we can go on a date.\u201d</p><p>TJ sighed, nodding his head. Cyrus noticed his drop in expression and placed a hand on his cheek. </p><p>\u201cHey, I know. Even I don\u2019t wanna sneak around anymore but, you and I both know Buffy and Andi are still not completely cool with you. I mean they\u2019re cool but they always talk about how I shouldn\u2019t have forgiven you so easily for the Costume Day thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Cy,\u201d TJ said, leaning his forehead against Cyrus\u2019. \u201cI don\u2019t expect them to be cool with me. And on that note,\u201d He said, pulling away from Cyrus a bit. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have forgiven me either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Cyrus said, pulling him back. \u201cWe aren\u2019t starting this again. You and I both know what happened, and I don\u2019t believe you when you say I shouldn\u2019t have forgiven you.\u201d</p><p>TJ gave a small smile as Cyrus kissed his cheek. He laughed a bit. </p><p>\u201cAt least one good thing came of this,\u201d He said, looking down at their interwoven fingers. \u201cNow what say we go catch that movie?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus smiled and nodded, leaning in for one more kiss before linking his arm with TJ\u2019s and walking ahead. They got their tickets and walked into the theatre, the movie not having begun yet. TJ turned to Cyrus, who had already made himself at home in his seat. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna get us popcorn and soda, okay?\u201d TJ whispered, squeezing Cyrus\u2019 hand and getting up. He headed over to get popcorn but stopped short when he saw the person at the counter. </p><p>\u201cAmber?!\u201d TJ yelled, and the blonde haired girl who was texting on her phone looked up and her eyes went wide. </p><p>\u201cTJ?!\u201d She exclaimed, dropping her phone in the commotion. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d TJ asked incredulously, walking over to her. </p><p>\u201cI took a job at the theatre just for a while to cover the layover at the Spoon,\u201d Amber said, shock still evident in her voice. \u201cWhat are YOU doing here? At this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, uh,\u201d TJ fumbled, trying to figure out how to not expose him and Cyrus\u2019 relationship. \u201cI got bored, so I snuck out to see a movie.\u201d</p><p>Amber narrowed her eyes, disbelief clouding her face. TJ just sighed, rolling his eyes. \u201cCan you just give me a buttered popcorn and a soda? Thanks,\u201d He said, throwing his money on the counter as Amber huffed and gave him his things. As he walked away, her mind was racing. </p><p><i>Why was TJ here? Was he actually alone? If not\u2026 </i></p><p><i>Who was he with? </i></p><p>Before she could think any further, her phone chimed and she opened the message, beaming. </p><p><b>Andi: im omw to the theatre now wait for me xx </b></p><p>TJ headed back to his seat, smiling softly as he handed Cyrus the popcorn.</p><p>\u201cHey, you took so long. I got worried\u201d Cyrus whispered, as the lights dimmed, indicating the movie beginning. </p><p>TJ took a minute to think about whether he should tell Cyrus about who he saw working, but then decided against it, deeming it not important, as he leaned down to kiss his forehead. </p><p>\u201cJust a line, babe. Let\u2019s enjoy the movie now.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cAnd one cherry soda for the Slayer herself,\u201d Marty said, as he sat down beside Buffy handing her the bottle. She smiled gleefully, taking a sip and instantly leaning back with a sigh. </p><p>\u201cOh my god, whoever invented chilled drinks, i\u2019m free Thursday,\u201d She said, smiling at Marty raising his eyebrows. </p><p>\u201cBuffy it is Thursday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t have to be this Thursday,\u201d She said with a wink. Marty just laughed, clinking his cola bottle with hers. </p><p>\u201cCheers to us, just a couple of not-just-friends on a not-date,\u201d Marty said, causing Buffy to almost sit out her drink. </p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Buffy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou used the word!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, date?\u201d Marty asked, Buffy just shoving him by the shoulder. \u201cFine, on a not-platonic-outing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d She said, sinking into her seat. </p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you worried about meeting your friends here?\u201d He asked, furrowing his eyebrows. Buffy just shrugged. </p><p>\u201cCyrus wouldn\u2019t sneak out of the house and Andi has her parents there. We\u2019ll be fine. We won\u2019t see anyone we know.\u201d</p><p>Marty just nodded, turning to see the movie, the two of them keenly aware of the lack of distance between their hands. </p><p>*</p><p>As the credits of the movie began to roll, TJ looked down at his shoulder where Cyrus\u2019 head was, him clutching onto his arm and snuggling up to TJ. TJ\u2019s arm was around Cyrus\u2019 shoukders, and honestly, neither wanted to move. But Cyrus finally pried himself away from TJ. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just gonna go to the bathroom, okay? We can leave after 5 minutes, he whispered, leaning over to kiss TJ before he got up. </p><p>As he headed over to the bathroom, he saw out of the corner of his eye an attendant and another girl laughing and standing really close together, but he paid no attention, drowsiness taking over his whole system. He went into the bathroom and splashed water on his face, trying to keep himself at peak alertness to sneak back home. He smiled to himself, thinking about how the night had gone, the perfect date he had just had with TJ. It did suck that they had to sneak around for the past month, but he wouldn\u2019t trade the quiet moments he got with TJ for anything. Wiping his face, he walked out of the bathroom, going back to the theatre to meet TJ. However, as he was leaving, he barreled right into a girl walking out of the other washroom. </p><p>\u201d Oh my god I\u2019m so sorry,\u201c The two said simultaneously, but when Cyrus looked up he stopped short. </p><p>Buffy. </p><p>\"Cyrus?! What are you doing here?\u201d Buffy yelled, her eyes wide. </p><p>\u201cI could ask you the same thing!\u201d Cyrus replied, stepping back in shock. </p><p>\u201cUm, I, uh,\u201d Buffy started, mumbling. \u201cI came to get popcorn!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the movie is over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I just want more popcorn,\u201d Buffy said, walking up to the counter, her eyes fixed on Cyrus, who was now following her. </p><p>\u201cHey can i get a- OH MY GOD,\u201d Buffy exclaimed, and Cyrus saw the two girls from before jump away from each other, flustered, as if they were about to kiss but had been interrupted. Cyrus shook his head, wondering why on earth Buffy would be so scandalised until he saw who it was. And he and Buffy looked at each other before yelling. </p><p>\u201cAndi?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCyrus! Buffy!\u201d Andi yelled, moving away from Amber and nearly tripping over the counter in the process. She lesned on it as casually as she could, hand in her hip. \u201cWhat are you guys doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing almost kissing Amber Kippen?!\u201d Buffy said, pointing at Amber who was standing very awkwardly to the corner. She then turned back to Cyrus. \u201cAnd you still haven\u2019t answered my question!\u201d</p><p>Cyrus was about to try and come up with an excuse when he noticed a figure walking up from behind Buffy. </p><p>\u201cHey Cy, you were taking a bit of time. Need me to drop you home, in typical date night fashion?\u201d TJ asked as he walked up, not noticing Cyrus motioning to stop talking until it was too late. The girl who stood in front of Cyrus turned around and TJ stopped short when he saw Buffy\u2019s confused and annoyed face staring back at him. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018date\u2019?\u201d She asked quietly, narrowing her eyes. </p><p>TJ turned to Amber who was currently finding the floor very fascinating, and he looked down. He cleared his throat. </p><p>\u201cAmber, why are you holding Andi\u2019s hand?\u201d He asked, making them drop their hands away, Amber pushing a strand of hair behind her ear and Andi scratching her hand. Andi looked curiously between TJ and Cyrus and the puzzle pieces clicked. </p><p>\u201cYou guys are dating?\u201d She asked, looking between TJ and Cyrus. Before Buffy could make any remark, Marty walked into the lobby. </p><p>\u201cHey Driscoll, what happened? You were late and,\u201d He trailed off, seeing all the people around the room. </p><p>Cyrus narrowed his eyes. \u201cWait, you guys are here together?\u201d</p><p>An awkward silence fell among the group, everyone eyeing each other up in confusion and shock. Eventually, Amber reached down and put a cherry cola on the counter with a straw. </p><p>\u201cCola anyone?\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>Cyrus walked down to the Spoon, his feet dragging behind him. It had been more than a day since the theatre incident, as his brain was calling it. He hadnt spoken or texted Andi or Buffy in all that time, and he didn\u2019t even know why. This should have just been a funny one-off where they all laughed about what had happened, but for some reason they were all confused and hurt. He had talked to TJ for hours on FaceTime, where TJ tried reassuring him that everything was okay, but Cyrus wasn\u2019t so sure. For some reason, this felt big. </p><p>He pushed open the doors of the Spoon, scanning the place to look for TJ, but he hadnt come yet. Cyrus sighed and sat down in a booth, taking out his phone. </p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d TJ said as he approached, and Cyrus smiled as TJ slid into the seat beside him. </p><p>\u201cWhy did you want to meet?\u201d Cyrus asked curiously, unsure of what TJ wanted. Before TJ could say anything, the door chimed open and Marty and Buffy walked in and Marty draged Buffy to the booth where TJ and Cyrus were, sitting in front of them. Cyrus looked up at Buffy and immediately looked down, Buffy doing the same. Marty and TJ sighed. </p><p>As if on cue, Amber walked in, dragging Andi by the hand and pulled up two chairs, sitting at their table. A silence fell over them, everyone unsure of who was going to start talking. Eventually, Amber spoke. </p><p>\u201cYou guys need to talk,\u201d she said, looking at the group. \u201cMarty, TJ and I spoke and all three of you are driving your respective people insane by your worrying, so you need to talk.\u201d</p><p>Andi sighed, leanign forward. \u201cYou\u2019re right. We do. Because, one thing none of us ever like doing is keep secrets from each other.\u201d Cyrus gave a small smile at that, and Buffy sighed. </p><p>Cyrus took a deep breath, looking at TJ questioningly before starting. \u201cTJ and I were in a date. We\u2019ve been together for a month now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just tell us?\u201d Buffy asked, furrowing her eyebrows. </p><p>Cyrus just shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you guys would react. You guys keep talking about how I shouldn\u2019t have forgiven him, but I couldn\u2019t tell you why I did. Because that would involve me telling you TJ\u2019s reason. And that wasn\u2019t my place.\u201d</p><p>Andi looked at TJ. \u201cYour reason for doing the costume with Kira?\u201d </p><p>TJ nodded hesitantly. \u201cShe found out about me liking Cyrus. Apparently, I wasn\u2019t as subtle as I thought. And she kinda, used it against me,\u201d He said in a quiet voice. \u201cI agree with you, Cyrus really shouldn\u2019t have\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo you\u2019re wrong,\u201d Buffy said, reaching across to squeeze TJ\u2019s hand. \u201cTJ we had no idea. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be,\u201d he said with a smile. Cyrus reached over and interlocked their fingers. </p><p>\u201cI just didn\u2019t know how to tell yoy. So we kept it a secret. I\u2019m sorry, I should\u2019ve told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay Cy,\u201d Buffy said, shaking her head. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re sorry for making you think you couldn\u2019t tell us,\u201d Andi said, reaching to hold Cyrus\u2019 hand. </p><p>Cyrus smiled, turning to Andi. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>Andi held her breath, moving her hand to hold Amber\u2019s, who was nodding encouragingly. \u201cI may have just realised that I\u2019m not straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndi,\u201d Cyrus said softly, smiling at her. Buffy, who was sitting next to her, pulled her in for a hug. </p><p>\u201cYeah, and I figured out that I liked Amber,\u201d She continued, smiling at Amber. \u201cAnd somehow, she liked me too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBambi, how could I not like you,\u201d Amber said, lenaing in to kiss Andi\u2019s cheek. \u201cBut we are still fuguring it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really happy for you guys,\u201d TJ said, smiling as he gave his sister a fist bump. </p><p>Andi laughed, turning to cup Amber\u2019s cheek and kiss her. To the background score of the group going \u201cOoooooh\u201d.</p><p>\u201c Wait wait wait,\u201d Cyrus said after everyone had calmed down. \u201cWe still don\u2019t know about Buffy. Marty was with you at the theater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Andi said, leaning in. \u201cWere you two on a-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah guys it\u2019s just two not-friends on a not-platonic-outing,\u201d Marty said, cutting Andi off. The others looked incredibly confused and unconvinced. </p><p>\u201cA not-platonic-outing? Seriously?\u201d TJ asked, deadpanned. </p><p>\u201cHets are incredibly confusing,\u201d Amber mumbled, earning a high-five from Cyrus. </p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s what it was,\u201d Marty said, turning to flash a quick smile at Buffy. Buffy looked at Marty, and made up her mind. She grabbed Marty\u2019s hand, much to his surprise. </p><p>\u201cActually, we were on a date. Like our second one,\u201d she said with a smile. </p><p>Marty looked over at her in surprise, a smile on his face. \u201cYou said the word,\u201d He said softly. </p><p>\u201cCall it like it is, right?\u201d She said, leaning against him with a smile. </p><p>\u201cSo, everything is out in the open now?\u201d Andi asked, and everyone nodded, smiling and laughing. </p><p>\u201cThis seemed like the best moment to clink glasses, but we have none,\u201d Marty said, causing Buffy to shove him in the shoulder as the others laughed. </p><p>A couple moments later, Jonah walked in with his characteristic smile and pulled up a chair. </p><p>\u201cHey guys,\u201d He said with a smile, everyone at the table suddenly aware that Jonah did not know what had just happened. </p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>~~~~</p><p><i>Hope you like it! </i></p><p><b><a href=\"https://green-lemonboys.tumblr.com/post/184971730799/so-i-am-extremely-uninspired-lol\">Send me prompts and I\u2019ll do them in a few days! </a></b></p>",

What are you doing here?&rdquo; Buffy yelled, her eyes wide. </p><p>&ldquo;I could ask you the same thing!&rdquo; Cyrus replied, stepping back in shock. </p><p>&ldquo;Um, I, uh,&rdquo; Buffy started, mumbling. &ldquo;I came to get popcorn!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But the movie is over?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe I just want more popcorn,&rdquo; Buffy said, walking up to the counter, her eyes fixed on Cyrus, who was now following her. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey can i get a- OH MY GOD,&rdquo; Buffy exclaimed, and Cyrus saw the two girls from before jump away from each other, flustered, as if they were about to kiss but had been interrupted. Cyrus shook his head, wondering why on earth Buffy would be so scandalised until he saw who it was. And he and Buffy looked at each other before yelling. </p><p>&ldquo;Andi?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus! Buffy!&rdquo; Andi yelled, moving away from Amber and nearly tripping over the counter in the process. She lesned on it as casually as she could, hand in her hip. &ldquo;What are you guys doing here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing almost kissing Amber Kippen?!&rdquo; Buffy said, pointing at Amber who was standing very awkwardly to the corner. She then turned back to Cyrus. &ldquo;And you still haven&rsquo;t answered my question!&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus was about to try and come up with an excuse when he noticed a figure walking up from behind Buffy. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey Cy, you were taking a bit of time. Need me to drop you home, in typical date night fashion?&rdquo; TJ asked as he walked up, not noticing Cyrus motioning to stop talking until it was too late. The girl who stood in front of Cyrus turned around and TJ stopped short when he saw Buffy&rsquo;s confused and annoyed face staring back at him. </p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean, &lsquo;date&rsquo;?&rdquo; She asked quietly, narrowing her eyes. </p><p>TJ turned to Amber who was currently finding the floor very fascinating, and he looked down. He cleared his throat. </p><p>&ldquo;Amber, why are you holding Andi&rsquo;s hand?&rdquo; He asked, making them drop their hands away, Amber pushing a strand of hair behind her ear and Andi scratching her hand. Andi looked curiously between TJ and Cyrus and the puzzle pieces clicked. </p><p>&ldquo;You guys are dating?&rdquo; She asked, looking between TJ and Cyrus. Before Buffy could make any remark, Marty walked into the lobby. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey Driscoll, what happened? You were late and,&rdquo; He trailed off, seeing all the people around the room. </p><p>Cyrus narrowed his eyes. &ldquo;Wait, you guys are here together?&rdquo;</p><p>An awkward silence fell among the group, everyone eyeing each other up in confusion and shock. Eventually, Amber reached down and put a cherry cola on the counter with a straw. </p><p>&ldquo;Cola anyone?&rdquo;</p><p>*</p><p>Cyrus walked down to the Spoon, his feet dragging behind him. It had been more than a day since the theatre incident, as his brain was calling it. He hadnt spoken or texted Andi or Buffy in all that time, and he didn&rsquo;t even know why. This should have just been a funny one-off where they all laughed about what had happened, but for some reason they were all confused and hurt. He had talked to TJ for hours on FaceTime, where TJ tried reassuring him that everything was okay, but Cyrus wasn&rsquo;t so sure. For some reason, this felt big. </p><p>He pushed open the doors of the Spoon, scanning the place to look for TJ, but he hadnt come yet. Cyrus sighed and sat down in a booth, taking out his phone. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; TJ said as he approached, and Cyrus smiled as TJ slid into the seat beside him. </p><p>&ldquo;Why did you want to meet?&rdquo; Cyrus asked curiously, unsure of what TJ wanted. Before TJ could say anything, the door chimed open and Marty and Buffy walked in and Marty draged Buffy to the booth where TJ and Cyrus were, sitting in front of them. Cyrus looked up at Buffy and immediately looked down, Buffy doing the same. Marty and TJ sighed. </p><p>As if on cue, Amber walked in, dragging Andi by the hand and pulled up two chairs, sitting at their table. A silence fell over them, everyone unsure of who was going to start talking. Eventually, Amber spoke. </p><p>&ldquo;You guys need to talk,&rdquo; she said, looking at the group. &ldquo;Marty, TJ and I spoke and all three of you are driving your respective people insane by your worrying, so you need to talk.&rdquo;</p><p>Andi sighed, leanign forward. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. We do. Because, one thing none of us ever like doing is keep secrets from each other.&rdquo; Cyrus gave a small smile at that, and Buffy sighed. </p><p>Cyrus took a deep breath, looking at TJ questioningly before starting. &ldquo;TJ and I were in a date. We&rsquo;ve been together for a month now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you just tell us?&rdquo; Buffy asked, furrowing her eyebrows. </p><p>Cyrus just shrugged. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how you guys would react. You guys keep talking about how I shouldn&rsquo;t have forgiven him, but I couldn&rsquo;t tell you why I did. Because that would involve me telling you TJ&rsquo;s reason. And that wasn&rsquo;t my place.&rdquo;</p><p>Andi looked at TJ. &ldquo;Your reason for doing the costume with Kira?&rdquo; </p><p>TJ nodded hesitantly. &ldquo;She found out about me liking Cyrus. Apparently, I wasn&rsquo;t as subtle as I thought. And she kinda, used it against me,&rdquo; He said in a quiet voice. &ldquo;I agree with you, Cyrus really shouldn&rsquo;t have&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No you&rsquo;re wrong,&rdquo; Buffy said, reaching across to squeeze TJ&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;TJ we had no idea. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; he said with a smile. Cyrus reached over and interlocked their fingers. </p><p>&ldquo;I just didn&rsquo;t know how to tell yoy. So we kept it a secret. I&rsquo;m sorry, I should&rsquo;ve told you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay Cy,&rdquo; Buffy said, shaking her head. </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re sorry for making you think you couldn&rsquo;t tell us,&rdquo; Andi said, reaching to hold Cyrus&rsquo; hand. </p><p>Cyrus smiled, turning to Andi. &ldquo;What about you?&rdquo;</p><p>Andi held her breath, moving her hand to hold Amber&rsquo;s, who was nodding encouragingly. &ldquo;I may have just realised that I&rsquo;m not straight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Andi,&rdquo; Cyrus said softly, smiling at her. Buffy, who was sitting next to her, pulled her in for a hug. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, and I figured out that I liked Amber,&rdquo; She continued, smiling at Amber. &ldquo;And somehow, she liked me too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bambi, how could I not like you,&rdquo; Amber said, lenaing in to kiss Andi&rsquo;s cheek. &ldquo;But we are still fuguring it out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really happy for you guys,&rdquo; TJ said, smiling as he gave his sister a fist bump. </p><p>Andi laughed, turning to cup Amber&rsquo;s cheek and kiss her. To the background score of the group going &ldquo;Ooooooh&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo; Wait wait wait,&rdquo; Cyrus said after everyone had calmed down. &ldquo;We still don&rsquo;t know about Buffy. Marty was with you at the theater.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Andi said, leaning in. &ldquo;Were you two on a-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nah guys it&rsquo;s just two not-friends on a not-platonic-outing,&rdquo; Marty said, cutting Andi off. The others looked incredibly confused and unconvinced. </p><p>&ldquo;A not-platonic-outing? Seriously?&rdquo; TJ asked, deadpanned. </p><p>&ldquo;Hets are incredibly confusing,&rdquo; Amber mumbled, earning a high-five from Cyrus. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s what it was,&rdquo; Marty said, turning to flash a quick smile at Buffy. Buffy looked at Marty, and made up her mind. She grabbed Marty&rsquo;s hand, much to his surprise. </p><p>&ldquo;Actually, we were on a date. Like our second one,&rdquo; she said with a smile. </p><p>Marty looked over at her in surprise, a smile on his face. &ldquo;You said the word,&rdquo; He said softly. </p><p>&ldquo;Call it like it is, right?&rdquo; She said, leaning against him with a smile. </p><p>&ldquo;So, everything is out in the open now?&rdquo; Andi asked, and everyone nodded, smiling and laughing. </p><p>&ldquo;This seemed like the best moment to clink glasses, but we have none,&rdquo; Marty said, causing Buffy to shove him in the shoulder as the others laughed. </p><p>A couple moments later, Jonah walked in with his characteristic smile and pulled up a chair. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey guys,&rdquo; He said with a smile, everyone at the table suddenly aware that Jonah did not know what had just happened. </p><p>&ldquo;So, what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p><p>~~~~</p><p><i>Hope you like it! </i></p><p><b><a href=\"https://green-lemonboys.tumblr.com/post/184971730799/so-i-am-extremely-uninspired-lol\">Send me prompts and I&rsquo;ll do them in a few days! </a></b></p>",
