The rest of the class follow shortly behind with Todoroki just hovering his feet a few inches over the floor, and Bakugo crossing his feet up in the couch. Midoriya stood unbalanced on the chair he was sitting on with a panicked look on his face.</p><p>Iida, like the class representative as he was, took responsibility and stood on the floor and karate chopped the air.</p><p>&ldquo;Everyone, calm down! The floor is not lava! I repeat: the floor is NOT lava. Stop with this childish attitude!&rdquo;</p><p>Of course, their childish attitude didn&rsquo;t disappear. One time, Iida was going to ask Midoriya something about the day&rsquo;s training. He was walking in the hallway as he saw Kaminari walk out of his room. But not normally. He was using an All Might duvet to jump his way down the hall. Iida didn&rsquo;t ask what he was doing, probably for the best. He pushed Midoriya&rsquo;s door aside and saw his classmate standing on his desk, like he just had seen a spider. There were pencils and papers on the floor, and the duvet on his bed was gone. Iida walked straight in the middle of Midoriya&rsquo;s room and looked at the boy on the desk.</p><p>&ldquo;Midoriya, we need to talk about your professionalism.&rdquo;</p><p>The green head boy looked at the class representative with wide eyes and gave him a I&rsquo;m-a-child-and-I-don&rsquo;t-approve-look.</p><p>&ldquo;Those are some mighty brave words for a guy standing in lava.&rdquo; </p></p>",

He knew every single thing that happened before him and after him, and every in-between. The part of their story where they fell in love was the part that Kirishima knew best.</p><p>With wide eyes and an expectant smile, Kirishima hopped onto his bed after tumbling into his bedroom as his mother followed a few steps behind him. He bounced up and down in his seated position in the middle of all his pillows and blankets, almost giddy with excitement and the little motions that accompanied it.</p><p>\u201cMa, tell me again how you and Dad fell in love!\u201d</p><p>His mother let out a fond laugh, the sound of it echoing in his room and causing him to mirror her. She smoothed his hair with a smile and asked \u201cagain, cupcake?\u201d even if the answer he would give was always the same \u201cyes!\u201d night after night.</p><p>Kirishima found himself inching closer and closer to his mother who was seated in the old armchair across from his bed \u2013 he had been told it was red because that was Granny\u2019s favourite colour, so he couldn\u2019t wait to see red the most of all the colours \u2013 as he shifted closer to the edge of the bed just as his mother would recount the instance of her first kiss with his father. His mother scooped him up just as he was about to fall off, and she set him down beside her for the rest of her story. Kirishima always fell asleep after his mother said \u201cthen I held you in my arms, and you were barely the size of my forearm!\u201d The first time he had heard what happened after that was when he was eight and could stay up past the part of the story where he was born.</p><p>Even if it\u2019s been a while since he last asked his mother to tell him that story, he could recite it to the letter. With the same gestures and the same intonation as his mother, even.</p><p>Now that he was older, now that he had experienced a crush here and there, he was wondering when his own love story would begin.</p><p>His parents were soulmates. They knew it from the moment their eyes met in a sea of people at a popular tourist spot in Tokyo during the blistering heat of summer. Kirishima hadn\u2019t experienced it himself, but simply picturing how the world would come to life in every colour had him letting out an awestruck sigh at the beauty of it all, even if he couldn\u2019t see it yet.</p><p>So he waited.</p><p>Waited for that magical sliver of a second when his world would cease to be monochrome and become full to bursting with colour of every kind. Waited for the moment when he would find himself locking eyes with a stranger who would be stopped in their tracks by the sudden realisation of his existence \u2013 that he was their soulmate \u2013 as he would be by them.</p><p>But waiting was a lonely, arduous thing.</p><p>Kirishima was already in the middle school and still waiting. He was still waiting, when plenty of his friends had found their soulmates. He was still waiting, when most of the students in his middle school already had the privilege of knowing who their soulmates were. He was still waiting, even when the results of his application to UA had been mailed out to his house and he found out that he got in, as he\u2019d wanted for the longest time.</p><p>\u201cMa.\u201d</p><p>His mother turned her attention away from the vegetables she was washing, and turned to him. One look at him and she put the knife down where it wouldn\u2019t be disturbed, washed her hands and sat him down beside her at the dining table.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, cupcake?\u201d</p><p>Kirishima fiddled with his fingers and the friendship bracelet that had been gifted to him by a friend who had all but disappeared from his life once he had found his soulmate.</p><p>\u201cHow old were you when you met Dad again?\u201d</p><p>His voice sounded smaller than he felt in that moment. His mother set her hand on his head and stroked his hair. \u201cSixteen. You\u2019re not quite sixteen yet, are you? You still have a ways to go anyway. The average age to meet your soulmate is getting younger by the year, but it\u2019s not like you\u2019re an outlier or anything, Ei-chan!\u201d</p><p>Kirishima took his mother\u2019s reassurances and held them closer to his chest than his own heart. Sixteen. He had more than two years to go before he turned sixteen.</p><p>He found himself counting down the days until his sixteenth birthday, crossing out the boxes on the calendar on his nightstand just before he fell asleep every night. Each big, black cross meant a day closer to becoming sixteen, a day closer to becoming an outlier, an abnormal person. Kirishima found a restless anxiety starting to form in his gut the day he turned fifteen, and he was still without a soulmate.</p><p>Kirishima had three hundred and sixty five days to go before he was sixteen.</p><p>At three hundred and fifty seven days, one of his closest friends celebrated his first anniversary with his soulmate. Kirishima went to a small okonomiyaki place to celebrate with them, all smiles and good cheer, even with the shadow of possibly being a freak without a soulmate looming dark and tall over him.</p><p>At three hundred and twenty one days, his homeroom teacher announced that she was getting married to her soulmate sometime during the winter holidays. The class had come together to organise a surprise party to congratulate her on the last day of school. Kirishima was the only one who didn\u2019t have a soulmate, and naturally, the lot of picking up party supplies fell on him because \u201cit\u2019s not like he has someone waiting to have a date with him anyway\u201d. Kirishima made a mental note not to lend that classmate his pens anymore with a huff, the cold winter nipping at all exposed skin as he made his way home lugging all the party supplies he had been tasked to buy.</p><p>At two hundred and eighty days, his parents celebrated their wedding anniversary. He had asked them to tell him their love story once more, as he has done since he was a little boy. In the moments when his parents were animated in their storytelling and definitely very much in love, Kirishima managed to forget the fact that he had yet to begin his own venture into that part of life. The day ended with him sitting with his legs crossed in bed and with his calendar in his hands, counting the days left until he would turn sixteen once and then counting it a second and third time to make sure he still had time.</p><p>When two hundred and eighty ebbed into two hundred and twenty-or-something-else, Kirishima was at the point where he would wilfully not cross out the days as they passed, just for the illusion that he still had time and plenty of it. When two hundred and twenty-or-something-else dwindled into hundred-something, he had stopped counting. He crossed the days out as and when he felt the need to, so he seldom did. The one time he sat down to update his calendar properly, he found that he barely had fifty days before he would turn sixteen.</p><p>Not even fifty days, and he would become an abnormal person.</p><p>Kirishima leaned forward until his head was in his hands, sigh after sigh falling from lips like he knew nothing else. Not even fifty days.</p><p>\u201cSon, you need to get some fresh air! Quit being cooped up in there.\u201d</p><p>His mother sent him off with a grocery list and a comforting pat on the back. His father handed him more money than he knew he needed for the usual grocery run for his family, and said \u201cbuy something extra for yourself\u201d when he pushed him out of the house.</p><p>Kirishima squinted. He brought the paper closer to his face and tried to decipher what it was that he was supposed to buy. There were fifteen items on the list and he could barely read one. His father\u2019s handwriting was something he had yet to learn how to read without difficulty. It was trying to read Greek!</p><p>He barely registered a flash of brown somewhere on his left before he felt someone run into him with enough force to send him staggering backwards a tad.</p><p>Wait.</p><p>Brown? Since when\u2013</p><p>Kirishima squeezed his eyes shut, counted to three and then blinked, watching intently for when his vision would clear and he could be sure if he had imagined that flash of colour.</p><p>\u201cHey, man. I\u2019m so sorry! I wasn\u2019t watching where I was going and\u2013\u201c</p><p>He bent down to pick up your wallet \u2013 it was red! \u2013 and handed it back to you with a sheepish smile, his other hand resting on the back of his neck. \u201cNo worries! I wasn\u2019t paying attention either.\u201d</p><p>You took your wallet from him and shoved it through the half-open zipper of your bag, keeping your eyes fixed on him the entire time.</p><p>\u201cCan I\u2026 help you?\u201d</p><p>The second those words left his mouth, Kirishima wanted nothing more than to shove himself into some deep, dark abyss until you would pass him by and get on with your life as if this just hadn\u2019t happened to you. But he stood his ground and steeled his smile as he waited with bated breath for your response.</p><p>\u201cYou. You\u2019re my soulmate, yeah?\u201d</p><p>He blinked.</p><p>\u201cIf you can see colour now, then yeah,\u201d Kirishima said, surprising even himself with how level he managed to keep his voice.</p><p>You took a resolute step towards him, nearly stomping on his right foot. You blinked. Kirishima blinked back, and then instinct kicked in when you abruptly swung your fist his way. He raised his arm to intercept your fist as it landed on the side of his forearm that was toughened from near relentless physical training.</p><p>\u201cHey! What was that for? Not cool, man!\u201d</p><p>You put both your hands on your hips and leaned forward, the frown evident on your face. \u201cD\u2019you know how long I\u2019ve been waiting for you? Where are you even from, anyway? You from around here?\u201d</p><p>Kirishima lowered the arm he had raised in his defence, and he laughed, the relief from finally meeting you welling up in him until it was running over in the form of tears rolling down his face and into his open mouth.</p><p>\u201cUh, hey. Sorry for trying to punch you? I didn\u2019t even put much force behind it, so, like, why are you even crying? You\u2019re a tough guy, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He scrubbed the back of his hands over his face and said, \u201cYou\u2019re not the only one who\u2019s been waiting long! I\u2019ve been waiting for you almost my entire life. And now you\u2019re here. I need\u2013 to process it. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>You reached into your pocket and pulled out a handkerchief to offer him. Kirishima immediately brightened when he recognised the print of the handkerchief in his hand.</p><p>\u201cSo you like All Might too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell yeah. And also, that\u2019s a terrible first conversation topic when meeting your soulmate.\u201d</p><p>He wiped at the parts of his face that were damp and sticky from his tears with a laugh and a smile that\u2019s wider than he remembered smiling in a long time, a smile that was on his face out of his own volition and not to keep up appearances.</p><p>\u201cYou can start then,\u201d he said, folding your handkerchief neatly and taking your hand, spreading it open so he could return it.</p><p>You took the handkerchief from him and stuffed it back into your pocket, your expression matching his, as if the two of you were perfectly in sync even if it was the first time his path had collided with yours.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d you asked, taking another step towards him. There was a shyness behind your movements that wasn\u2019t present before. Kirishima mimicked your action and took a step closer to you, close enough that his feet were more or less hedging yours. There was an unspeakable joy tickling him from the inside when he took a glance at the concrete and found that your shoes were red like your wallet, that his shoes were too dirty to be considered white anymore.</p><p>\u201cEijirou,\u201d he said, easily, like he was meant to say it to you in that very second.</p><p>\u201cEijirou,\u201d you repeated, and his name was a song coming from your lips. \u201cMoving fast, aren\u2019t you? Taking to first name basis so easily.\u201d</p><p>Kirishima leaned forward ever so slightly, and when he spoke, he could feel his breath mingling with yours. \u201cYou still owe me your name, angel,\u201d he said, because you were nothing less than the most perfect godsend for him.</p><p>You took him by the front of his Crimson Riot t-shirt and breathed your name into his lips.</p>",

Kirishima always fell asleep after his mother said \u201cthen I held you in my arms, and you were barely the size of my forearm!\u201d The first time he had heard what happened after that was when he was eight and could stay up past the part of the story where he was born.</p><p>Even if it\u2019s been a while since he last asked his mother to tell him that story, he could recite it to the letter. With the same gestures and the same intonation as his mother, even.</p><p>Now that he was older, now that he had experienced a crush here and there, he was wondering when his own love story would begin.</p><p>His parents were soulmates. They knew it from the moment their eyes met in a sea of people at a popular tourist spot in Tokyo during the blistering heat of summer. Kirishima hadn\u2019t experienced it himself, but simply picturing how the world would come to life in every colour had him letting out an awestruck sigh at the beauty of it all, even if he couldn\u2019t see it yet.</p><p>So he waited.</p><p>Waited for that magical sliver of a second when his world would cease to be monochrome and become full to bursting with colour of every kind. Waited for the moment when he would find himself locking eyes with a stranger who would be stopped in their tracks by the sudden realisation of his existence \u2013 that he was their soulmate \u2013 as he would be by them.</p><p>But waiting was a lonely, arduous thing.</p><p>Kirishima was already in the middle school and still waiting. He was still waiting, when plenty of his friends had found their soulmates. He was still waiting, when most of the students in his middle school already had the privilege of knowing who their soulmates were. He was still waiting, even when the results of his application to UA had been mailed out to his house and he found out that he got in, as he\u2019d wanted for the longest time.</p><p>\u201cMa.\u201d</p><p>His mother turned her attention away from the vegetables she was washing, and turned to him. One look at him and she put the knife down where it wouldn\u2019t be disturbed, washed her hands and sat him down beside her at the dining table.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, cupcake?\u201d</p><p>Kirishima fiddled with his fingers and the friendship bracelet that had been gifted to him by a friend who had all but disappeared from his life once he had found his soulmate.</p><p>\u201cHow old were you when you met Dad again?\u201d</p><p>His voice sounded smaller than he felt in that moment. His mother set her hand on his head and stroked his hair. \u201cSixteen. You\u2019re not quite sixteen yet, are you? You still have a ways to go anyway. The average age to meet your soulmate is getting younger by the year, but it\u2019s not like you\u2019re an outlier or anything, Ei-chan!\u201d</p><p>Kirishima took his mother\u2019s reassurances and held them closer to his chest than his own heart. Sixteen. He had more than two years to go before he turned sixteen.</p><p>He found himself counting down the days until his sixteenth birthday, crossing out the boxes on the calendar on his nightstand just before he fell asleep every night. Each big, black cross meant a day closer to becoming sixteen, a day closer to becoming an outlier, an abnormal person. Kirishima found a restless anxiety starting to form in his gut the day he turned fifteen, and he was still without a soulmate.</p><p>Kirishima had three hundred and sixty five days to go before he was sixteen.</p><p>At three hundred and fifty seven days, one of his closest friends celebrated his first anniversary with his soulmate. Kirishima went to a small okonomiyaki place to celebrate with them, all smiles and good cheer, even with the shadow of possibly being a freak without a soulmate looming dark and tall over him.</p><p>At three hundred and twenty one days, his homeroom teacher announced that she was getting married to her soulmate sometime during the winter holidays. The class had come together to organise a surprise party to congratulate her on the last day of school. Kirishima was the only one who didn\u2019t have a soulmate, and naturally, the lot of picking up party supplies fell on him because \u201cit\u2019s not like he has someone waiting to have a date with him anyway\u201d. Kirishima made a mental note not to lend that classmate his pens anymore with a huff, the cold winter nipping at all exposed skin as he made his way home lugging all the party supplies he had been tasked to buy.</p><p>At two hundred and eighty days, his parents celebrated their wedding anniversary. He had asked them to tell him their love story once more, as he has done since he was a little boy. In the moments when his parents were animated in their storytelling and definitely very much in love, Kirishima managed to forget the fact that he had yet to begin his own venture into that part of life. The day ended with him sitting with his legs crossed in bed and with his calendar in his hands, counting the days left until he would turn sixteen once and then counting it a second and third time to make sure he still had time.</p><p>When two hundred and eighty ebbed into two hundred and twenty-or-something-else, Kirishima was at the point where he would wilfully not cross out the days as they passed, just for the illusion that he still had time and plenty of it. When two hundred and twenty-or-something-else dwindled into hundred-something, he had stopped counting. He crossed the days out as and when he felt the need to, so he seldom did. The one time he sat down to update his calendar properly, he found that he barely had fifty days before he would turn sixteen.</p><p>Not even fifty days, and he would become an abnormal person.</p><p>Kirishima leaned forward until his head was in his hands, sigh after sigh falling from lips like he knew nothing else. Not even fifty days.</p><p>\u201cSon, you need to get some fresh air! Quit being cooped up in there.\u201d</p><p>His mother sent him off with a grocery list and a comforting pat on the back. His father handed him more money than he knew he needed for the usual grocery run for his family, and said \u201cbuy something extra for yourself\u201d when he pushed him out of the house.</p><p>Kirishima squinted. He brought the paper closer to his face and tried to decipher what it was that he was supposed to buy. There were fifteen items on the list and he could barely read one. His father\u2019s handwriting was something he had yet to learn how to read without difficulty. It was trying to read Greek!</p><p>He barely registered a flash of brown somewhere on his left before he felt someone run into him with enough force to send him staggering backwards a tad.</p><p>Wait.</p><p>Brown? Since when\u2013</p><p>Kirishima squeezed his eyes shut, counted to three and then blinked, watching intently for when his vision would clear and he could be sure if he had imagined that flash of colour.</p><p>\u201cHey, man. I\u2019m so sorry! I wasn\u2019t watching where I was going and\u2013\u201c</p><p>He bent down to pick up your wallet \u2013 it was red! \u2013 and handed it back to you with a sheepish smile, his other hand resting on the back of his neck. \u201cNo worries! I wasn\u2019t paying attention either.\u201d</p><p>You took your wallet from him and shoved it through the half-open zipper of your bag, keeping your eyes fixed on him the entire time.</p><p>\u201cCan I\u2026 help you?\u201d</p><p>The second those words left his mouth, Kirishima wanted nothing more than to shove himself into some deep, dark abyss until you would pass him by and get on with your life as if this just hadn\u2019t happened to you. But he stood his ground and steeled his smile as he waited with bated breath for your response.</p><p>\u201cYou. You\u2019re my soulmate, yeah?\u201d</p><p>He blinked.</p><p>\u201cIf you can see colour now, then yeah,\u201d Kirishima said, surprising even himself with how level he managed to keep his voice.</p><p>You took a resolute step towards him, nearly stomping on his right foot. You blinked. Kirishima blinked back, and then instinct kicked in when you abruptly swung your fist his way. He raised his arm to intercept your fist as it landed on the side of his forearm that was toughened from near relentless physical training.</p><p>\u201cHey! What was that for? Not cool, man!\u201d</p><p>You put both your hands on your hips and leaned forward, the frown evident on your face. \u201cD\u2019you know how long I\u2019ve been waiting for you? Where are you even from, anyway? You from around here?\u201d</p><p>Kirishima lowered the arm he had raised in his defence, and he laughed, the relief from finally meeting you welling up in him until it was running over in the form of tears rolling down his face and into his open mouth.</p><p>\u201cUh, hey. Sorry for trying to punch you? I didn\u2019t even put much force behind it, so, like, why are you even crying? You\u2019re a tough guy, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He scrubbed the back of his hands over his face and said, \u201cYou\u2019re not the only one who\u2019s been waiting long! I\u2019ve been waiting for you almost my entire life. And now you\u2019re here. I need\u2013 to process it. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>You reached into your pocket and pulled out a handkerchief to offer him. Kirishima immediately brightened when he recognised the print of the handkerchief in his hand.</p><p>\u201cSo you like All Might too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell yeah. And also, that\u2019s a terrible first conversation topic when meeting your soulmate.\u201d</p><p>He wiped at the parts of his face that were damp and sticky from his tears with a laugh and a smile that\u2019s wider than he remembered smiling in a long time, a smile that was on his face out of his own volition and not to keep up appearances.</p><p>\u201cYou can start then,\u201d he said, folding your handkerchief neatly and taking your hand, spreading it open so he could return it.</p><p>You took the handkerchief from him and stuffed it back into your pocket, your expression matching his, as if the two of you were perfectly in sync even if it was the first time his path had collided with yours.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d you asked, taking another step towards him. There was a shyness behind your movements that wasn\u2019t present before. Kirishima mimicked your action and took a step closer to you, close enough that his feet were more or less hedging yours. There was an unspeakable joy tickling him from the inside when he took a glance at the concrete and found that your shoes were red like your wallet, that his shoes were too dirty to be considered white anymore.</p><p>\u201cEijirou,\u201d he said, easily, like he was meant to say it to you in that very second.</p><p>\u201cEijirou,\u201d you repeated, and his name was a song coming from your lips. \u201cMoving fast, aren\u2019t you? Taking to first name basis so easily.\u201d</p><p>Kirishima leaned forward ever so slightly, and when he spoke, he could feel his breath mingling with yours. \u201cYou still owe me your name, angel,\u201d he said, because you were nothing less than the most perfect godsend for him.</p><p>You took him by the front of his Crimson Riot t-shirt and breathed your name into his lips.</p>",

He knew every single thing that happened before him and after him, and every in-between. The part of their story where they fell in love was the part that Kirishima knew best.</p><p>With wide eyes and an expectant smile, Kirishima hopped onto his bed after tumbling into his bedroom as his mother followed a few steps behind him. He bounced up and down in his seated position in the middle of all his pillows and blankets, almost giddy with excitement and the little motions that accompanied it.</p><p>\u201cMa, tell me again how you and Dad fell in love!\u201d</p><p>His mother let out a fond laugh, the sound of it echoing in his room and causing him to mirror her.

He knew every single thing that happened before him and after him, and every in-between. The part of their story where they fell in love was the part that Kirishima knew best.</p><p>With wide eyes and an expectant smile, Kirishima hopped onto his bed after tumbling into his bedroom as his mother followed a few steps behind him. He bounced up and down in his seated position in the middle of all his pillows and blankets, almost giddy with excitement and the little motions that accompanied it.</p><p>&ldquo;Ma, tell me again how you and Dad fell in love!&rdquo;</p><p>His mother let out a fond laugh, the sound of it echoing in his room and causing him to mirror her. She smoothed his hair with a smile and asked &ldquo;again, cupcake?&rdquo; even if the answer he would give was always the same &ldquo;yes!&rdquo; night after night.</p><p>Kirishima found himself inching closer and closer to his mother who was seated in the old armchair across from his bed &ndash; he had been told it was red because that was Granny&rsquo;s favourite colour, so he couldn&rsquo;t wait to see red the most of all the colours &ndash; as he shifted closer to the edge of the bed just as his mother would recount the instance of her first kiss with his father. His mother scooped him up just as he was about to fall off, and she set him down beside her for the rest of her story. Kirishima always fell asleep after his mother said &ldquo;then I held you in my arms, and you were barely the size of my forearm!&rdquo; The first time he had heard what happened after that was when he was eight and could stay up past the part of the story where he was born.</p><p>Even if it&rsquo;s been a while since he last asked his mother to tell him that story, he could recite it to the letter. With the same gestures and the same intonation as his mother, even.</p><p>Now that he was older, now that he had experienced a crush here and there, he was wondering when his own love story would begin.</p><p>His parents were soulmates. They knew it from the moment their eyes met in a sea of people at a popular tourist spot in Tokyo during the blistering heat of summer. Kirishima hadn&rsquo;t experienced it himself, but simply picturing how the world would come to life in every colour had him letting out an awestruck sigh at the beauty of it all, even if he couldn&rsquo;t see it yet.</p><p>So he waited.</p><p>Waited for that magical sliver of a second when his world would cease to be monochrome and become full to bursting with colour of every kind. Waited for the moment when he would find himself locking eyes with a stranger who would be stopped in their tracks by the sudden realisation of his existence &ndash; that he was their soulmate &ndash; as he would be by them.</p><p>But waiting was a lonely, arduous thing.</p><p>Kirishima was already in the middle school and still waiting. He was still waiting, when plenty of his friends had found their soulmates. He was still waiting, when most of the students in his middle school already had the privilege of knowing who their soulmates were. He was still waiting, even when the results of his application to UA had been mailed out to his house and he found out that he got in, as he&rsquo;d wanted for the longest time.</p><p>&ldquo;Ma.&rdquo;</p><p>His mother turned her attention away from the vegetables she was washing, and turned to him. One look at him and she put the knife down where it wouldn&rsquo;t be disturbed, washed her hands and sat him down beside her at the dining table.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, cupcake?&rdquo;</p><p>Kirishima fiddled with his fingers and the friendship bracelet that had been gifted to him by a friend who had all but disappeared from his life once he had found his soulmate.</p><p>&ldquo;How old were you when you met Dad again?&rdquo;</p><p>His voice sounded smaller than he felt in that moment. His mother set her hand on his head and stroked his hair. &ldquo;Sixteen. You&rsquo;re not quite sixteen yet, are you? You still have a ways to go anyway. The average age to meet your soulmate is getting younger by the year, but it&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re an outlier or anything, Ei-chan!&rdquo;</p><p>Kirishima took his mother&rsquo;s reassurances and held them closer to his chest than his own heart. Sixteen. He had more than two years to go before he turned sixteen.</p><p>He found himself counting down the days until his sixteenth birthday, crossing out the boxes on the calendar on his nightstand just before he fell asleep every night. Each big, black cross meant a day closer to becoming sixteen, a day closer to becoming an outlier, an abnormal person. Kirishima found a restless anxiety starting to form in his gut the day he turned fifteen, and he was still without a soulmate.</p><p>Kirishima had three hundred and sixty five days to go before he was sixteen.</p><p>At three hundred and fifty seven days, one of his closest friends celebrated his first anniversary with his soulmate. Kirishima went to a small okonomiyaki place to celebrate with them, all smiles and good cheer, even with the shadow of possibly being a freak without a soulmate looming dark and tall over him.</p><p>At three hundred and twenty one days, his homeroom teacher announced that she was getting married to her soulmate sometime during the winter holidays. The class had come together to organise a surprise party to congratulate her on the last day of school. Kirishima was the only one who didn&rsquo;t have a soulmate, and naturally, the lot of picking up party supplies fell on him because &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not like he has someone waiting to have a date with him anyway&rdquo;. Kirishima made a mental note not to lend that classmate his pens anymore with a huff, the cold winter nipping at all exposed skin as he made his way home lugging all the party supplies he had been tasked to buy.</p><p>At two hundred and eighty days, his parents celebrated their wedding anniversary. He had asked them to tell him their love story once more, as he has done since he was a little boy. In the moments when his parents were animated in their storytelling and definitely very much in love, Kirishima managed to forget the fact that he had yet to begin his own venture into that part of life. The day ended with him sitting with his legs crossed in bed and with his calendar in his hands, counting the days left until he would turn sixteen once and then counting it a second and third time to make sure he still had time.</p><p>When two hundred and eighty ebbed into two hundred and twenty-or-something-else, Kirishima was at the point where he would wilfully not cross out the days as they passed, just for the illusion that he still had time and plenty of it. When two hundred and twenty-or-something-else dwindled into hundred-something, he had stopped counting. He crossed the days out as and when he felt the need to, so he seldom did. The one time he sat down to update his calendar properly, he found that he barely had fifty days before he would turn sixteen.</p><p>Not even fifty days, and he would become an abnormal person.</p><p>Kirishima leaned forward until his head was in his hands, sigh after sigh falling from lips like he knew nothing else. Not even fifty days.</p><p>&ldquo;Son, you need to get some fresh air! Quit being cooped up in there.&rdquo;</p><p>His mother sent him off with a grocery list and a comforting pat on the back. His father handed him more money than he knew he needed for the usual grocery run for his family, and said &ldquo;buy something extra for yourself&rdquo; when he pushed him out of the house.</p><p>Kirishima squinted. He brought the paper closer to his face and tried to decipher what it was that he was supposed to buy. There were fifteen items on the list and he could barely read one. His father&rsquo;s handwriting was something he had yet to learn how to read without difficulty. It was trying to read Greek!</p><p>He barely registered a flash of brown somewhere on his left before he felt someone run into him with enough force to send him staggering backwards a tad.</p><p>Wait.</p><p>Brown? Since when&ndash;</p><p>Kirishima squeezed his eyes shut, counted to three and then blinked, watching intently for when his vision would clear and he could be sure if he had imagined that flash of colour.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, man. I&rsquo;m so sorry! I wasn&rsquo;t watching where I was going and&ndash;&ldquo;</p><p>He bent down to pick up your wallet &ndash; it was red! &ndash; and handed it back to you with a sheepish smile, his other hand resting on the back of his neck. &ldquo;No worries! I wasn&rsquo;t paying attention either.&rdquo;</p><p>You took your wallet from him and shoved it through the half-open zipper of your bag, keeping your eyes fixed on him the entire time.</p><p>&ldquo;Can I&hellip; help you?&rdquo;</p><p>The second those words left his mouth, Kirishima wanted nothing more than to shove himself into some deep, dark abyss until you would pass him by and get on with your life as if this just hadn&rsquo;t happened to you. But he stood his ground and steeled his smile as he waited with bated breath for your response.</p><p>&ldquo;You. You&rsquo;re my soulmate, yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>He blinked.</p><p>&ldquo;If you can see colour now, then yeah,&rdquo; Kirishima said, surprising even himself with how level he managed to keep his voice.</p><p>You took a resolute step towards him, nearly stomping on his right foot. You blinked. Kirishima blinked back, and then instinct kicked in when you abruptly swung your fist his way. He raised his arm to intercept your fist as it landed on the side of his forearm that was toughened from near relentless physical training.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey! What was that for? Not cool, man!&rdquo;</p><p>You put both your hands on your hips and leaned forward, the frown evident on your face. &ldquo;D&rsquo;you know how long I&rsquo;ve been waiting for you? Where are you even from, anyway? You from around here?&rdquo;</p><p>Kirishima lowered the arm he had raised in his defence, and he laughed, the relief from finally meeting you welling up in him until it was running over in the form of tears rolling down his face and into his open mouth.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, hey. Sorry for trying to punch you? I didn&rsquo;t even put much force behind it, so, like, why are you even crying? You&rsquo;re a tough guy, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>He scrubbed the back of his hands over his face and said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not the only one who&rsquo;s been waiting long! I&rsquo;ve been waiting for you almost my entire life. And now you&rsquo;re here. I need&ndash; to process it. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p><p>You reached into your pocket and pulled out a handkerchief to offer him. Kirishima immediately brightened when he recognised the print of the handkerchief in his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;So you like All Might too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hell yeah. And also, that&rsquo;s a terrible first conversation topic when meeting your soulmate.&rdquo;</p><p>He wiped at the parts of his face that were damp and sticky from his tears with a laugh and a smile that&rsquo;s wider than he remembered smiling in a long time, a smile that was on his face out of his own volition and not to keep up appearances.</p><p>&ldquo;You can start then,&rdquo; he said, folding your handkerchief neatly and taking your hand, spreading it open so he could return it.</p><p>You took the handkerchief from him and stuffed it back into your pocket, your expression matching his, as if the two of you were perfectly in sync even if it was the first time his path had collided with yours.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; you asked, taking another step towards him. There was a shyness behind your movements that wasn&rsquo;t present before. Kirishima mimicked your action and took a step closer to you, close enough that his feet were more or less hedging yours. There was an unspeakable joy tickling him from the inside when he took a glance at the concrete and found that your shoes were red like your wallet, that his shoes were too dirty to be considered white anymore.</p><p>&ldquo;Eijirou,&rdquo; he said, easily, like he was meant to say it to you in that very second.</p><p>&ldquo;Eijirou,&rdquo; you repeated, and his name was a song coming from your lips. &ldquo;Moving fast, aren&rsquo;t you? Taking to first name basis so easily.&rdquo;</p><p>Kirishima leaned forward ever so slightly, and when he spoke, he could feel his breath mingling with yours. &ldquo;You still owe me your name, angel,&rdquo; he said, because you were nothing less than the most perfect godsend for him.</p><p>You took him by the front of his Crimson Riot t-shirt and breathed your name into his lips.</p>",
