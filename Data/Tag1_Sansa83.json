Is sexually assaulted by Jorah Mormont, a much older man, who she trusts and views as a friend, and much, much more)</p><p>Jon: 14-16 (his relationship w/Ygritte in the books really irks me considering she\u2019s 17/18 and if the Jon were a woman and Ygritte were man it would be considered super sketch but whatever, takes on the job of Lord Commander when he\u2019s like 16) </p><p>Robb: 14-16 (goes to war, kills men at 14 because of Joffrey betrayal of his father, has the burden of kingship places upon him, is around 16 when he dies) </p><p>Sansa: 11-13 (12(?) when she is forced to marry Tyrion, though he doesn\u2019t force her to do anything (he still thinks about her sexually), is essentially groomed by LF, beaten and abused in front of the whole court, emotionally abused by Cersei, lives w/the guilt of having been forced by the Lannisters to essentially betray her father, has her beloved pet murdered for something she didn\u2019t do, etc.)</p><p>Arya: 9-11 (witnessed her father being beheaded, is later turned into an assassin by a super shady group of people, has her friend murdered by the Lannisters, finds a family in Gendry only to have that taken away, is seperated from her family, etc.) </p><p>Bran: 7-9 (is pushed from a window and permenantly disabled, is forced from his home + separated from his family)</p><p>Rickon: 2-4 (forced to flee Winterfell because it\u2019s taken over and is separated from his whole family) </p><p>Theon Greyjoy: 18/19(?)-20/21 (is castrated/tortured by Ramsay Bolton until he loses all sense of who he is) </p><p>Brienne of Tarth: 17-19 (witnesses the death of her king (who she is in love with), and is forced to take on various missions in a bid to fulfill her promise to Catelyn Stark) </p><p>Now I may be wrong by like a year or two for some of them but <i>still</i>. They\u2019re all so young. Also I couldn\u2019t list everything each other\u2019s characters went though bc I\u2019ve just began rereading the first book and I don\u2019t remember that much from the series. If you have anything to add feel free because I no doubt missed quite a few things/if I got anything wrong.</p>",

What he does owe her and Arya and Bran and the NL is an explanation of why he bent the knee (or maybe not bent the knee). The North is not an absolutistic state and therefore an explanation is needed - and this explanation is difficult.

Telling them D is a great queen might not work, they might see immediately that this is not the truth. But he also can&rsquo;t tell that D kept him prisoner and that he played along because that would piss of Da\u20acnerys. The woman has dragons and he has to let her believe that he came over because she is a amazeballs. So a public explanation in front of everybody is out of the question and Jon might decide to just stay silent on the matter - in the hope that the NL are not too angry or immediately suspect him of acting out of love.</p><p>Jon might even fear to give an explanation in private, because 'the best way to keep a secret is to tell nobody&rsquo;.

I\u2019m not saying there is not something like 'love of your life\u2019 but a) the love of your life might just not work out. And b) there is also an element of choice in love, because of course we fall in love, but we still have choices. Imagine being married and maybe even happily married and then you meet someone who is a perfect fit and who is one of the few people in the world who could be the 'love of your life\u2019. Then the important thing is what you choose to do. [Edit: And I think it is important that Jon and Sansa choose not to act on their feelings pre-parentage reveal]</p><p>A friend of mine is married to a man whose fiancee died in a car crash before he met her. If that car crash hadn\u2019t happened he would have married the other woman and might not even have met my friend. Yet now they are happy. Does this devalidate his first love? </p><p>I mean I do not believe in Ned/Ashara because I think it was Brandon/ Ashara, but just imagine for a moment that Ned having a tryst with Ashara at the tourney of Harrenhal, when he did not know Cat and had no duty to her, would devalidate 15 years of a marriage - when they both put a lot of effort into the marriage?</p><p>Just imagine for a moment that Jon were indeed Ned\u2019s son, and he decided to marry D for the good of the North, because he can\u2019t have Sansa anyway. Imagine just for a moment that maybe D was not such a hypocrite and actually a nice woman. Would you begrudge Jon an attempt to become happy despite his ill fated love for his half sister? Or would you expect him to stay miserable for the rest of his life? I mean I think Jon and D are ultimately and completely unfitting for each other, and they are doomed whatever happens between Jon and Sansa, but just play with the scenario for a moment.</p><p>Now I have this of my chest: Jon does not owe the woman he thinks is his half sister any explanation of his sex life, even being madly in love with Sansa (as I think he is). What he does owe her and Arya and Bran and the NL is an explanation of why he bent the knee (or maybe not bent the knee). The North is not an absolutistic state and therefore an explanation is needed - and this explanation is difficult. Because Jon might be loathe to tell everyone that D is a great queen and this is why he bent the knee. Telling them D is a great queen might not work, they might see immediately that this is not the truth. But he also can\u2019t tell that D kept him prisoner and that he played along because that would piss of Da\u20acnerys. The woman has dragons and he has to let her believe that he came over because she is a amazeballs. So a public explanation in front of everybody is out of the question and Jon might decide to just stay silent on the matter - in the hope that the NL are not too angry or immediately suspect him of acting out of love.</p><p>Jon might even fear to give an explanation in private, because 'the best way to keep a secret is to tell nobody\u2019. I don\u2019t envy him.</p><p>Now after RLJ, the situation is different and if Jon and Sansa do indeed become a couple Jon should talk about his tryst with D. If Political Jon is true he has to explain and he might tell Sansa that he only ever loved her, but imho there is no need to <b>apologize</b> or proving his worth.</p><p>If you look closely none of us is 'worthy\u2019 and we do not love because someone is 'worthy\u2019 of our love. If only 'worthy\u2019 people were loved, there would be many, many people who would have to go without love. I think one of the wonderful things about Jonsa is that they both have their faults but compliment each other perfectly.</p><p>I might be mistaken about your opinion and you were thinking that Jon owes an explanation (not an apology) for bending the knee. In this case I agree. In regard to <b>politics</b> he\u2019d better explain, to Sansa most of all but also to Bran and Arya.</p><p>Thanks for the ask or rather the discussion!</p>",
