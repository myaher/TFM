Jon supposed that now she had everything she ever wanted. She was a warrior, one of the best in the Seven Kingdoms, and Gendry would never force her to be a lady. Jon could picture Ned Stark looking at her now and just how proud he would be to see his youngest daughter\u2019s dreams coming true.</p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h2>Day Six</h2><p><b>The Hound has a few too many drinks and goes on and on about what Arya would mutter in her sleep while she was under his protection.</b></p><p>He slammed the cup down on the wood of the head table, completely oblivious of the loathsome glances from the other noblemen and women. He was beyond drunk, and when he was drunk he lost his wits, oftentimes losing complete control of his tongue. He had a tendency of not connecting his brain and his mouth. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Gods boy would you stop you moping?&rdquo; He all but shouted across the table where Gendry sat uncomfortably. &ldquo;What is it? Do you think if you keep staring at her she&rsquo;ll give you the time of day? I believe you lost that chance once she sailed across seas to Braavos, if you hadn&rsquo;t gone with the Red Witch the outcome probably would&rsquo;ve been different.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;What bullshit are you spilling now Clegane?&rdquo; Jon looked at him with that northern glare. The Hound ignored him completely, still talking directly at the sole Baratheon.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Every. Fucking. Night. She would go on and on about you in her sleep. Sometimes crying out your name in sorrow, other times anger, hell pleasure too I&rsquo;d bet.&rdquo; He took another gulp of his ale. &ldquo;She loved you once I&rsquo;d say, but you threw that all away when you decided to stay with the fucking Brotherhood.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone sat there and stared at the Hound, disbelief covered their faces. Every face except Arya&rsquo;s that is. Her face was shining beet-red from embarrassment. She mustn&rsquo;t of known what she did in her sleep all those years ago. He had enough sense to feel slightly guilty, but he also felt smug for knowing something she didn&rsquo;t. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;What little wolf?&rdquo; He yelled unabashedly. &ldquo;Cat got your tongue? Or should I say Hound?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arya lunged for him then, she must&rsquo;ve been thankful that she chose to wear trousers today, if she hadn&rsquo;t she wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to get at him so easily. That Valyrian steel blade was pressed to his throat so face that he didn&rsquo;t have time to move let alone breathe. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;You better watch that mouth of yours Clegane before you say something you regret.&rdquo; Arya pressed the blade a little harsher against the skin of his neck. He snarled at her and was about to pounce when Gendry spoke up.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Look, we all know I fucked up.&rdquo; He said frankly, &ldquo;No one here need you to remind me how I ruined my own future. I made the wrong decision and now I am going to have to live with that for the rest of my days. Forgive me your Grace, I&rsquo;m going to retire early.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gendry walked out of the great hall and into the night, but he wasn&rsquo;t out of earshot before the Hound yelp; &ldquo;What? Was it something I said?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gendry turned sharply and glared back, fully prepared to speak his mind once more, but he was beat to it when a loud slap rang against the stone walls. Arya had stuck Sandor so hard that he had a cut above his left eye that was slowly dripping blood. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Speak one more word against my friend and I&rsquo;ll make sure that you&rsquo;ll be bed ridden for a long period of time.&rdquo; She was seething now, she couldn&rsquo;t help it. Arya couldn&rsquo;t bear to watch someone talk down to Gendry about the mistakes he made in his past. She understood why he made them now. At the time he was a bastard boy and her mother and brother would never approve of their relationship, no matter what it was. She was highborn and he was not. She thought his actions were unforgivable, but the horrible things she has done over the years outweighed the choices he made. It mattered not what decisions the two of them made in the past, it was the present and the future was not promised. The God of Death promised nothing to anyone and she would be a fool to believe she had all the time in the world to hold petty grudges. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;What Gendry did in the past was cruel, but how I treated him was just as awful. We are new people now. For all you know we could be in love. So tell me Clegane, what is it that you think you know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What I know is that you two are both wasting this time you preach about not having enough of. That boy over there worships the ground you walk on, he treats you as some kind of goddess, but you&rsquo;re too blind to see it. You still hold a grudge over what he did in the past whether you want to admit it or not. Well little wolf, get over it. Pull up your trousers and act like the woman we all know you to be. Stop being scared of something you don&rsquo;t know the outcome of.&rdquo; The Hounds words chilled her, but she wouldn&rsquo;t let him win. She stalked right over to Gendry and grabbed his face, pulling it down to hers. Harshly she pressed her lips against his, at first full of spite and loathing for the Hound, but all thoughts of Sandor Clegane left her mind when she felt his arms snake around her waist. If she heard the cheers of approval she didn&rsquo;t acknowledge them. Her sole focus was him, and it would be foolish of her to waste more time. Gendry must&rsquo;ve been thinking the same thing when he let her go. He looked her in the eyes and with all the confidence in the world asked her the few words she never imagined herself saying yes to. &ldquo;Be mine, now and always.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now and always. From this day until my last day I will be yours Gendry Baratheon and you will be mine.&rdquo; From across the room Jon&rsquo;s eyes lowered to the floor and he couldn&rsquo;t help but think of his first love and those same words she uttered to him so many years ago. He&rsquo;d be a liar if he said she didn&rsquo;t haunt his dreams. Jon just hoped that for his sister&rsquo;s sake she would never suffer the loss of her love. Though he figured she had, but Arya being Arya she was never willing to let go of what she wanted or what she loved. Hell she still had needle. Jon supposed that now she had everything she ever wanted. She was a warrior, one of the best in the Seven Kingdoms, and Gendry would never force her to be a lady.

She wasn&rsquo;t certain she&rsquo;d be able to kill\nhim, even if she tried; he had his own sword, and he was a lot stronger.

He nodded. They called Hot Pie down\nfrom the wall and found Lommy Greenhands where he lay bleeding from a spear\nthrust through his calf. They found Gerren too, but he was hurt too bad to\nmove. As <b>they were running toward the\nbarn, Arya spied the crying girl sitting in the middle of the chaos, surrounded\nby smoke and slaughter. She grabbed her by the hand and pulled her to her feet\nas the others raced ahead. The girl wouldn&rsquo;t walk, even when slapped. Arya\ndragged her with her right hand while she held Needle in the left.</b> Ahead,\nthe night was a sullen red. The barn&rsquo;s on fire, she thought. Flames were\nlicking up its sides from where a torch had fallen on straw, and she could hear\nthe screaming of the animals trapped within. Hot Pie stepped out of the barn.\n&ldquo;Arry, come on!

I believe this part of her storyline was necessary because it will be in Braavos that Arya will learn how to be a warrior and in the end of the day, Westerosis armies will only follow warriors, so it was very important for Arya to experience this part of her journey.</p><p><br/></p><p>Her journey in the House of Black and White is also a big foreshadowing as her role as a leader in the end.\u00a0First as Cat of the Canals, she is forced to serve (which is a constant theme in George RRMartin story, he always makes sure, his future leaders spend part of their storyline serving, we will find the same theme on Jon, Sansa and Theon storyline.</p><p><br/></p><blockquote><p>\n\n&ldquo;You lie. You are Cat of the canals, I know you well. Go and sleep, child. On the morrow you must serve.&rdquo;&ldquo;<b>All men must serve.</b>&rdquo; And so she did, three days of every thirty. When the moon was black she was no one, a servant of the Many-Faced God in a robe of black and white. She walked beside the kindly man through the fragrant darkness, carrying her iron lantern. <b>She washed the dead, went through their clothes, and counted out their coins. Some days she still helped Umma cook, chopping big white mushrooms and boning fish. But only when the moon was black. </b>The rest of the time she was an orphan girl in a pair of battered boots too big for her feet and a brown cloak with a ragged hem, crying &ldquo;Mussels and cockles and clams&rdquo; as she wheeled her barrow through the Ragman&rsquo;s Harbor.<br/><br/></p><p>A Feast for Crows - Cat Of The Canals</p><p><br/></p></blockquote><p>\u00a0As part of her training, she is being educated in the lessosn of poisons and how to play the game of lies, which its going to be very useful once she returns to Westeros and starts her revenge game.</p><p><br/></p><blockquote><p><b>\n\n\n\nThat was her first lesson. There had been many more.<br/><br/></b></p><p><b>Poisons and potions were for the afternoons.</b> She had smell and touch and taste to help her, but touch and taste could be perilous when grinding poisons, and with some of the waif&rsquo;s more toxic concoctions even smell was less than safe. Burned pinky tips and blistered lips became familiar to her, and once she made herself so sick she could not keep down any food for days.\u00a0</p><p><b>Supper was for language lessons.\u00a0</b>The blind girl understood Braavosi and could speak it passably, she had even lost most of her barbaric accent, but the kindly man was not content.<b> He was insisting that she improve her High Valyrian and learn the tongues of Lys and Pentos too.\u00a0</b></p><p><b>In the evening she played the lying game with the waif, but without eyes to see the game was very different.</b> Sometimes all she had to go on was tone and choice of words; other times the waif allowed her to lay hands upon her face. At first the game was much, much harder, the next thing to impossible \u2026 but just when she was near the point of screaming with frustration, it all became much easier. She learned to hear the lies, to feel them in the play of the muscles around the mouth and eyes.</p><p><br/></p><p>A Dance with Dragons - The Blind Girl</p><p><br/></p></blockquote><p>She is learning on how to use her others senses and not depend only on her eyes, which is very important as a fighter.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nMany of her other duties had remained the same, but as she went about them she stumbled over furnishings, walked into walls, dropped trays, got hopelessly helplessly lost inside the temple. <b>Once she almost fell headlong down the steps, but Syrio Forel had taught her balance in another lifetime, when she was the girl called Arya, and somehow she recovered and caught herself in time.</b><br/><br/></p><p>\n\nSome nights she might have cried herself to sleep if she had still been Arry or Weasel or Cat, or even Arya of House Stark \u2026 but no one had no tears. <b>Withouteyes, even the simplest task was perilous.</b> She burned herself a dozen times as she worked with Umma in the kitchens. Once, chopping onions, she cut herfinger down to the bone. Twice she could not even find her own room in the cellar and had to sleep on the floor at the base of the steps.\u00a0</p><p><b>All the nooks and alcoves made the temple treacherous, even after the blind girl had learned to use her ears;</b> the way her footsteps bounced off the ceiling and echoed roundthe legs of the thirty tall stone gods made the walls themselves seem to move, and the pool of still black water did strange things to sound as well.</p><p><br/></p><p>A Dance with Dragons - The Blind Girl</p></blockquote><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>So,\nyes. I believe Arya storyline in the books is a hint that she end this story as\na queen. \u00a0Its no secret to anyone that I believe\nSansa will marry her cousin Jon Snow and both of them will rule the 7 kingdoms\nas King and Queen, so how does Queen Arya works then?<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>I believe The North will accept to a\nunion to the rest of the Kingdom via marriage, mirroring what happened to Dorne\nin the past. There is foreshadowing of the North refusing to bend the knee in\nthe end and joining the Union using a marriage alliance in the books:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;MY LORDS!&rdquo; he shouted,\nhis voice booming off the rafters. &ldquo;Here is what I say to these two\nkings!&rdquo; He spat. &ldquo;Renly Baratheon is nothing to me, nor Stannis\nneither. Why should they rule over me and mine, from some flowery seat in\nHighgarden or Dorne? <b>What do they know\nof the Wall or the wolfswood or the barrows of the First Men? Even their gods\nare wrong.</b> The Others take the Lannisters too, I&rsquo;ve had a bellyful of\nthem.&rdquo; He reached back over his shoulder and drew his immense two-handed\ngreatsword. &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t we rule ourselves again? It was the dragons we\nmarried, and the dragons are all dead!&rdquo; He pointed at Robb with the blade.\n&ldquo;There sits the only king I mean to bow my knee to, m'lords,&rdquo; he\nthundered. &ldquo;The King in the North!&rdquo; </p><p>A GAME OF THRONES Catelyn XI </p></blockquote><p>Funny how Jon Snow fits\nLord Greatjon\u00a0 Umber description of a good King for the North. Jon was Lord\nCommander of the Nights Watch, he knows about the Wolfswood and follows the Old\nGods. So, I predict the North would accept a union as long as Jon married a\nStark, which would be Sansa. And just like Dorne was able to keep some\nindependence, the North would also keep the right to call their heirs as Kings\nand Queens in the North.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This would parallel what\nhappened when Scotland decided that they no longer wanted to be part of the\nEnglish Kingdom and rebelled against the crown, starting The Wars of Scottish\nIndependence, were a series of military campaigns were fought between the\nKingdom of Scotland and the Kingdom of England in the late 13th and early 14th\ncenturies.</p><p>The conflicts came to and end with the The Treaty of\nEdinburgh\u2013Northampton and a few years later, the Treaty of Berwick (1357).\nScotland became an independent country, with its own King and ruler, yet still\npart of the Great Britain Kingdom.\u00a0<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>And I want to point out this cute foreshadowing that <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUdltV7CT5rkYP_xKh3KxyA\">@sherlokiness</a> posted on my last meta about this theory.</p><p><br/></p><blockquote><p>Her sister was a queen, <b>why not her?</b></p><p>A Dance with Dragons - Jon XIII</p></blockquote><p><br/></p><p>YES, why not Arya too???</p>",

There had been many more.<br><br></b></p><p><b>Poisons and potions were for the afternoons.</b> She had smell and touch and taste to help her, but touch and taste could be perilous when grinding poisons, and with some of the waif\u2019s more toxic concoctions even smell was less than safe. Burned pinky tips and blistered lips became familiar to her, and once she made herself so sick she could not keep down any food for days.\u00a0</p><p><b>Supper was for language lessons.\u00a0</b>The blind girl understood Braavosi and could speak it passably, she had even lost most of her barbaric accent, but the kindly man was not content.<b> He was insisting that she improve her High Valyrian and learn the tongues of Lys and Pentos too.\u00a0</b></p><p><b>In the evening she played the lying game with the waif, but without eyes to see the game was very different.</b> Sometimes all she had to go on was tone and choice of words; other times the waif allowed her to lay hands upon her face. At first the game was much, much harder, the next thing to impossible \u2026 but just when she was near the point of screaming with frustration, it all became much easier. She learned to hear the lies, to feel them in the play of the muscles around the mouth and eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>A Dance with Dragons - The Blind Girl</p><p><br></p></blockquote><p>She is learning on how to use her others senses and not depend only on her eyes, which is very important as a fighter.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nMany of her other duties had remained the same, but as she went about them she stumbled over furnishings, walked into walls, dropped trays, got hopelessly helplessly lost inside the temple. <b>Once she almost fell headlong down the steps, but Syrio Forel had taught her balance in another lifetime, when she was the girl called Arya, and somehow she recovered and caught herself in time.</b><br><br></p><p>\n\nSome nights she might have cried herself to sleep if she had still been Arry or Weasel or Cat, or even Arya of House Stark \u2026 but no one had no tears. <b>Withouteyes, even the simplest task was perilous.</b> She burned herself a dozen times as she worked with Umma in the kitchens. Once, chopping onions, she cut herfinger down to the bone. Twice she could not even find her own room in the cellar and had to sleep on the floor at the base of the steps.\u00a0</p><p><b>All the nooks and alcoves made the temple treacherous, even after the blind girl had learned to use her ears;</b> the way her footsteps bounced off the ceiling and echoed roundthe legs of the thirty tall stone gods made the walls themselves seem to move, and the pool of still black water did strange things to sound as well.</p><p><br></p><p>A Dance with Dragons - The Blind Girl</p></blockquote><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So,\nyes. I believe Arya storyline in the books is a hint that she end this story as\na queen. \u00a0Its no secret to anyone that I believe\nSansa will marry her cousin Jon Snow and both of them will rule the 7 kingdoms\nas King and Queen, so how does Queen Arya works then?<br></p><p><br></p><p>I believe The North will accept to a\nunion to the rest of the Kingdom via marriage, mirroring what happened to Dorne\nin the past. There is foreshadowing of the North refusing to bend the knee in\nthe end and joining the Union using a marriage alliance in the books:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cMY LORDS!\u201d he shouted,\nhis voice booming off the rafters. \u201cHere is what I say to these two\nkings!\u201d He spat. \u201cRenly Baratheon is nothing to me, nor Stannis\nneither. Why should they rule over me and mine, from some flowery seat in\nHighgarden or Dorne? <b>What do they know\nof the Wall or the wolfswood or the barrows of the First Men? Even their gods\nare wrong.</b> The Others take the Lannisters too, I\u2019ve had a bellyful of\nthem.\u201d He reached back over his shoulder and drew his immense two-handed\ngreatsword. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t we rule ourselves again? It was the dragons we\nmarried, and the dragons are all dead!\u201d He pointed at Robb with the blade.\n\u201cThere sits the only king I mean to bow my knee to, m'lords,\u201d he\nthundered. \u201cThe King in the North!\u201d </p><p>A GAME OF THRONES Catelyn XI </p></blockquote><p>Funny how Jon Snow fits\nLord Greatjon\u00a0 Umber description of a good King for the North. Jon was Lord\nCommander of the Nights Watch, he knows about the Wolfswood and follows the Old\nGods. So, I predict the North would accept a union as long as Jon married a\nStark, which would be Sansa. And just like Dorne was able to keep some\nindependence, the North would also keep the right to call their heirs as Kings\nand Queens in the North.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This would parallel what\nhappened when Scotland decided that they no longer wanted to be part of the\nEnglish Kingdom and rebelled against the crown, starting The Wars of Scottish\nIndependence, were a series of military campaigns were fought between the\nKingdom of Scotland and the Kingdom of England in the late 13th and early 14th\ncenturies.</p><p>The conflicts came to and end with the The Treaty of\nEdinburgh\u2013Northampton and a few years later, the Treaty of Berwick (1357).\nScotland became an independent country, with its own King and ruler, yet still\npart of the Great Britain Kingdom.\u00a0<br></p><p><br></p><p>And I want to point out this cute foreshadowing that <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUdltV7CT5rkYP_xKh3KxyA\">@sherlokiness</a> posted on my last meta about this theory.</p><p><br></p><blockquote><p>Her sister was a queen, <b>why not her?</b></p><p>A Dance with Dragons - Jon XIII</p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>YES, why not Arya too???</p></p>",

At first the game was much, much harder, the next thing to impossible \u2026 but just when she was near the point of screaming with frustration, it all became much easier. She learned to hear the lies, to feel them in the play of the muscles around the mouth and eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>A Dance with Dragons - The Blind Girl</p><p><br></p></blockquote><p>She is learning on how to use her others senses and not depend only on her eyes, which is very important as a fighter.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nMany of her other duties had remained the same, but as she went about them she stumbled over furnishings, walked into walls, dropped trays, got hopelessly helplessly lost inside the temple. <b>Once she almost fell headlong down the steps, but Syrio Forel had taught her balance in another lifetime, when she was the girl called Arya, and somehow she recovered and caught herself in time.</b><br><br></p><p>\n\nSome nights she might have cried herself to sleep if she had still been Arry or Weasel or Cat, or even Arya of House Stark \u2026 but no one had no tears. <b>Withouteyes, even the simplest task was perilous.</b> She burned herself a dozen times as she worked with Umma in the kitchens. Once, chopping onions, she cut herfinger down to the bone. Twice she could not even find her own room in the cellar and had to sleep on the floor at the base of the steps.\u00a0</p><p><b>All the nooks and alcoves made the temple treacherous, even after the blind girl had learned to use her ears;</b> the way her footsteps bounced off the ceiling and echoed roundthe legs of the thirty tall stone gods made the walls themselves seem to move, and the pool of still black water did strange things to sound as well.</p><p><br></p><p>A Dance with Dragons - The Blind Girl</p></blockquote><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So,\nyes. I believe Arya storyline in the books is a hint that she end this story as\na queen. \u00a0Its no secret to anyone that I believe\nSansa will marry her cousin Jon Snow and both of them will rule the 7 kingdoms\nas King and Queen, so how does Queen Arya works then?<br></p><p><br></p><p>I believe The North will accept to a\nunion to the rest of the Kingdom via marriage, mirroring what happened to Dorne\nin the past. There is foreshadowing of the North refusing to bend the knee in\nthe end and joining the Union using a marriage alliance in the books:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cMY LORDS!\u201d he shouted,\nhis voice booming off the rafters. \u201cHere is what I say to these two\nkings!\u201d He spat. \u201cRenly Baratheon is nothing to me, nor Stannis\nneither. Why should they rule over me and mine, from some flowery seat in\nHighgarden or Dorne? <b>What do they know\nof the Wall or the wolfswood or the barrows of the First Men? Even their gods\nare wrong.</b> The Others take the Lannisters too, I\u2019ve had a bellyful of\nthem.\u201d He reached back over his shoulder and drew his immense two-handed\ngreatsword. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t we rule ourselves again? It was the dragons we\nmarried, and the dragons are all dead!\u201d He pointed at Robb with the blade.\n\u201cThere sits the only king I mean to bow my knee to, m'lords,\u201d he\nthundered. \u201cThe King in the North!\u201d </p><p>A GAME OF THRONES Catelyn XI </p></blockquote><p>Funny how Jon Snow fits\nLord Greatjon\u00a0 Umber description of a good King for the North. Jon was Lord\nCommander of the Nights Watch, he knows about the Wolfswood and follows the Old\nGods.

At first the game was much, much harder, the next thing to impossible &hellip; but just when she was near the point of screaming with frustration, it all became much easier. She learned to hear the lies, to feel them in the play of the muscles around the mouth and eyes.</p><p><br /></p><p>A Dance with Dragons - The Blind Girl</p><p><br /></p></blockquote><p>She is learning on how to use her others senses and not depend only on her eyes, which is very important as a fighter.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nMany of her other duties had remained the same, but as she went about them she stumbled over furnishings, walked into walls, dropped trays, got hopelessly helplessly lost inside the temple. <b>Once she almost fell headlong down the steps, but Syrio Forel had taught her balance in another lifetime, when she was the girl called Arya, and somehow she recovered and caught herself in time.</b><br /><br /></p><p>\n\nSome nights she might have cried herself to sleep if she had still been Arry or Weasel or Cat, or even Arya of House Stark &hellip; but no one had no tears. <b>Withouteyes, even the simplest task was perilous.</b> She burned herself a dozen times as she worked with Umma in the kitchens.

I believe Arya storyline in the books is a hint that she end this story as\na queen. &nbsp;Its no secret to anyone that I believe\nSansa will marry her cousin Jon Snow and both of them will rule the 7 kingdoms\nas King and Queen, so how does Queen Arya works then?<br /></p><p><br /></p><p>I believe The North will accept to a\nunion to the rest of the Kingdom via marriage, mirroring what happened to Dorne\nin the past. There is foreshadowing of the North refusing to bend the knee in\nthe end and joining the Union using a marriage alliance in the books:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;MY LORDS!&rdquo; he shouted,\nhis voice booming off the rafters. &ldquo;Here is what I say to these two\nkings!&rdquo; He spat. &ldquo;Renly Baratheon is nothing to me, nor Stannis\nneither. Why should they rule over me and mine, from some flowery seat in\nHighgarden or Dorne? <b>What do they know\nof the Wall or the wolfswood or the barrows of the First Men? Even their gods\nare wrong.</b> The Others take the Lannisters too, I&rsquo;ve had a bellyful of\nthem.&rdquo; He reached back over his shoulder and drew his immense two-handed\ngreatsword. &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t we rule ourselves again? It was the dragons we\nmarried, and the dragons are all dead!&rdquo; He pointed at Robb with the blade.\n&ldquo;There sits the only king I mean to bow my knee to, m'lords,&rdquo; he\nthundered. &ldquo;The King in the North!&rdquo; </p><p>A GAME OF THRONES Catelyn XI </p></blockquote><p>Funny how Jon Snow fits\nLord Greatjon&nbsp; Umber description of a good King for the North. Jon was Lord\nCommander of the Nights Watch, he knows about the Wolfswood and follows the Old\nGods. So, I predict the North would accept a union as long as Jon married a\nStark, which would be Sansa. And just like Dorne was able to keep some\nindependence, the North would also keep the right to call their heirs as Kings\nand Queens in the North.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This would parallel what\nhappened when Scotland decided that they no longer wanted to be part of the\nEnglish Kingdom and rebelled against the crown, starting The Wars of Scottish\nIndependence, were a series of military campaigns were fought between the\nKingdom of Scotland and the Kingdom of England in the late 13th and early 14th\ncenturies.</p><p>The conflicts came to and end with the The Treaty of\nEdinburgh&ndash;Northampton and a few years later, the Treaty of Berwick (1357).\nScotland became an independent country, with its own King and ruler, yet still\npart of the Great Britain Kingdom.&nbsp;<br /></p><p><br /></p><p>And I want to point out this cute foreshadowing that <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUdltV7CT5rkYP_xKh3KxyA\">@sherlokiness</a> posted on my last meta about this theory.</p><p><br /></p><blockquote><p>Her sister was a queen, <b>why not her?</b></p><p>A Dance with Dragons - Jon XIII</p></blockquote><p><br /></p><p>YES, why not Arya too???</p></p>",
