And the style!!!! I haven\u2019t been this enamored with an animated movie\u2019s artistic style since <i>Song of the Sea </i>(or any Cartoon Saloon movie, really), and it was such a nice experience. I kept waiting for maybe one scene to just not work or not amaze me as much as the last, but no, the entire movie was just gorgeous and so interesting to look at. <br/>I definitely want to download it once it\u2019s out just so I can go through it frame by frame. And I really hope the dvd/blu-ray shows a lot of the storyboards because I\u2019d love to see how this movie was mapped out. Color keys would be nice to see, too.</li><li>I cried more than I expected to, lmao. First when Peter B. met up with Aunt May (who\u2019s voiced by Lily Tomlin by the way, that was a nice surprise), then when Miles\u2019 father told him he loved him through the closed door, and then a little at the very end just because the overall message was so sweet.</li><li>I was kind of hoping Peter B. would recognize Gwen, or at least have a\u00a0\u201choly shit, you\u2019re alive???\u201d moment with her, but I guess that would have pulled too much focus away from his subplot with MJ, so it\u2019s fine. I did really like that it looked like he was going to patch things up with her at the end now that he\u2019s confident about being a parent.<br/>Now that I think of it, though, did Peter B. even have the dead Gwen storyline in his dimension? I assumed Gwen dying would be part of any Spider-Man universe where he eventually ends up with MJ, but I\u2019m not familiar with the comics, so idk.</li><li>Miles is adorable and really just a great character all-around. I haven\u2019t seen the MCU Spider-Man movies, so this may be something that\u2019s done well in those too, but this was the first Spider-Man movie where I actually believed Spidey was a kid. I mean, the Tobey Maguire movies came out when I was still a kid myself, so I never really saw him as someone around my age. And I always thought Andrew Garfield\u2019s take was good, but he was also too confident for me to really see him as a typical teenager, so he seemed older than his character.<br/>But Miles is written very believably as a teenager, and I like that his inexperience as a hero (and just with life in general) is what really drives his character arc. He had this really organic coming-of-age storyline, and I loved it.<br/>There were also other little things that really made his age more apparent, like him going straight home to his parents because he was upset and afraid after watching Spider-Man die, or him deliberately trying to fail out of his new school because suddenly being surrounded by other smart kids made him insecure (holy fuck was that relatable as a former ~G&amp;T kid), or him being hyper aware of all the other kids noticing every time he did something embarrassing.<br/>Not that adults never do any of those things, ofc, but all those details made him seem that much more vulnerable, so you really appreciate his growth and confidence by the end of the movie.</li><li>All the Spidey gang\u2019s interactions were great.
