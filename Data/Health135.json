We fast forwarded through a few parts (let\u2019s be honest <em>nobody</em> wants to see the stampede scene) and also replayed a few parts that Chase loved like the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkWs3HVww4I\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Timon and Pumbaa hula scene</a>. <em>\u201cAre ya achin\u2019\u2026 yum, yum, yum\u2026 for some bacon\u2026 yum, yum, yum.\u201d\u00a0</em>I seriously love reliving some of my childhood favorites with my kids.

I had some errands I wanted to run after church so I dropped Ryan off at home with Chase so they could play outside and took a fast-asleep Ryder along with me to do some holiday returns and exchanges.</p>\n<p>Ryder and I arrived home to find Chase, Ryan and Sadie running around and Chase testing out his Strider bike.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3310.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84681\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3310-939x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"471\" height=\"514\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3310-939x1024.jpg 939w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3310-275x300.jpg 275w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3310-768x838.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3310.jpg 1467w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 471px) 100vw, 471px\"></a></p>\n<p>He\u2019s still trying to get the hang of his bike, but he\u2019s definitely determined to learn how to balance on it!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3357.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84684\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3357-1024x804.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"592\" height=\"465\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3357-1024x804.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3357-300x236.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3357-768x603.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3357.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px\"></a></p>\n<p>Eventually we made our way inside and I started what I thought was going to be dinner prep but it ended up being our lunch because it was too good to resist!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3383.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84686\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3383-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"390\" height=\"585\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3383-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3383-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3383-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3383.jpg 1067w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 390px) 100vw, 390px\"></a></p>\n<p>I made the\u00a0<a href=\"https://lexiscleankitchen.com/chicken-and-broccoli/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instant Pot Chinese Chicken and Broccoli</a> from Lexi\u2019s Clean Kitchen and it was fantastic!!! I even doubled the amount of broccoli for more veggies (the broccoli cooks down and the recipe is rather saucy) and we loved it over brown rice. Add this one to your must-make list ASAP. You won\u2019t regret it!</p>\n<p>The rest of our Sunday included laundry, cleaning up the house and another family walk to round out the evening.</p>\n<p>As for today, Chase is back at preschool and Ryder has his 6-month pediatric visit so I\u2019m off to get things moving this morning. I hope you all have a fantastic week!</p>\n\n<br><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/first-weekend-of-2019/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">[Read More \u2026]</a><br><br><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/first-weekend-of-2019/\">https://www.pbfingers.com/first-weekend-of-2019/</a></p>",

We fast forwarded through a few parts (let&rsquo;s be honest <em>nobody</em> wants to see the stampede scene) and also replayed a few parts that Chase loved like the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkWs3HVww4I\" target=\"_blank\">Timon and Pumbaa hula scene</a>. <em>&ldquo;Are ya achin&rsquo;&hellip; yum, yum, yum&hellip; for some bacon&hellip; yum, yum, yum.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em>I seriously love reliving some of my childhood favorites with my kids. Such an underrated perk of mom life!</p>\n<h4>Sunday</h4>\n<p>Sunday morning began like most Sundays do around here with breakfast (<a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/peanut-butter-baked-steel-cut-oatmeal/\" target=\"_blank\">baked steel cut oatmeal</a>) followed by the early morning service at our church. I had some errands I wanted to run after church so I dropped Ryan off at home with Chase so they could play outside and took a fast-asleep Ryder along with me to do some holiday returns and exchanges.</p>\n<p>Ryder and I arrived home to find Chase, Ryan and Sadie running around and Chase testing out his Strider bike.</p>\n<p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3310-939x1024.jpg\">External image</div></p>\n<p>He&rsquo;s still trying to get the hang of his bike, but he&rsquo;s definitely determined to learn how to balance on it!</p>\n<p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3357-1024x804.jpg\">External image</div></p>\n<p>Eventually we made our way inside and I started what I thought was going to be dinner prep but it ended up being our lunch because it was too good to resist!</p>\n<p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3383-683x1024.jpg\">External image</div></p>\n<p>I made the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lexiscleankitchen.com/chicken-and-broccoli/\" target=\"_blank\">Instant Pot Chinese Chicken and Broccoli</a> from Lexi&rsquo;s Clean Kitchen and it was fantastic!!! I even doubled the amount of broccoli for more veggies (the broccoli cooks down and the recipe is rather saucy) and we loved it over brown rice. Add this one to your must-make list ASAP. You won&rsquo;t regret it!</p>\n<p>The rest of our Sunday included laundry, cleaning up the house and another family walk to round out the evening.</p>\n<p>As for today, Chase is back at preschool and Ryder has his 6-month pediatric visit so I&rsquo;m off to get things moving this morning. I hope you all have a fantastic week!</p>\n\n<br /><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/first-weekend-of-2019/\" target=\"_blank\">[Read More &hellip;]</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/first-weekend-of-2019/\">https://www.pbfingers.com/first-weekend-of-2019/</a></p>",

For ab and leg day I don&rsquo;t use weights because they are difficult to incorporate, but for arms I use dumbells and resistance band unless I am very fatigued then I use my own body resistance.</p> <p>I have a set routine that takes around 10 minutes to 20 depending on the muscle group. Lately doing 20 reps of the exercises I do has been difficult due to more weakness and fatigue I&rsquo;ve been having lately.So I was wondering if it might be more beneficial to do 10 reps of all the exercises for that muscle group multiple times through out the day. Possibly even down to 5 4 times a day that would equal up to the usual 20.</p> <p>My usual routine for legs for instances is 6 Pilates based leg moves, 20 reps each</p> <p>10 Physical therapy leg lifts where I lay down and raise one leg up, tensing my quads as best I can, hold for ten seconds then switch. Each rep is both legs, not one.</p> <p>30 seconds to a minute of a full wall sit, hamstrings parallel to the floor as much as possible.</p> <p>I was wondering if breaking all those up into 10 sets for each move, 5 PT moves and only 30 seconds of wall sits multiple times a day may actually get better, or hopefully the same benefit as pushing through all of them.</p> <p>Or is it better to just do a full work out with all the reps? If I broke it up in the day, I could do 30 or 40 in total instead of the 20 I do for the day, but I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s better to just do as hard as possible all at once, or break it up during the day still garners a pretty nice benefit.</p> <p>My goal is to lose a lot of weight, but retain some muscle or even build a little/gain strength. During all this I&rsquo;ve gained some definition in my arms, so I know it&rsquo;s possible to gain muscle benefit even while low calorie to some degree, but now I just need to know a routine I can keep up with.</p> <p>\u200b</p> <p>Thank you very much for any advice.</p> </div><br/><br/>\nSubmitted January 07, 2019 at 03:15AM by Sinvanor<br/>\nvia reddit <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2M1W2Vr\" target=\"_blank\">http://bit.ly/2M1W2Vr</a>",

Kadakia served as chief executive officer (CEO) for the first four years of the company before stepping down in 2017 and becoming the executive chairman.<blockquote> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BqDLypigRFC/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" target=\"_blank\">       View this post on Instagram            </a><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BqDLypigRFC/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by Payal Kadakia Pujji (@payal)</a> on Nov 11, 2018 at 10:15am PST</p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have always been someone who wanted to make sure that I never fit into a box &hellip; and at some point I felt like I was, everyone was, trying to put me in this box, and I was like, &lsquo;This is not how I&rsquo;m going to add the best value to my company.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>Kadakia and then-executive chairman, Fritz Lanman, swapped roles.</p><p>&ldquo;I just wanted to make sure I was creating the vision for my company and pushing that forward, and that was the only thing that mattered,&ldquo; she added. &ldquo;The only way you can make a decision like that is by having the right person, and I think for Fritz and me, we&rsquo;ve been partners for so long that it was just so gradual and easy.&rdquo;</p><p>While Kadakia was growing her company, she always kept dancing, simultaneously serving as the artistic director for The Sa Dance Company that she founded in 2009. It&rsquo;s something she said helped her while building ClassPass.</p><blockquote> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BrGG5zSgb8T/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" target=\"_blank\">       View this post on Instagram            </a><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BrGG5zSgb8T/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by Payal Kadakia Pujji (@payal)</a> on Dec 7, 2018 at 10:01am PST</p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;Building the dance company taught me these really tactical things &hellip; you have to learn a new job every day especially when you&rsquo;re starting,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like you need to be the best marketer, the best salesperson, the best product person and you just have to figure it out on the spot, and I really learned all those amazing skills just by having to do it.&rdquo;</p><p>But running her dance company didn&rsquo;t just teach her tactical skills. It was also something that became important to her as a leader, so much so that when investors and even her own parents suggested she give it up, it wasn&rsquo;t something she considered.</p><p>&ldquo;Everyone just wanted me to make sure I was taking care of myself, but taking care of myself meant dancing.&rdquo;</p><p>Not listening to the &ldquo;worst advice&rdquo; is something that Kadakia has learned can be necessary as an entrepreneur. She said that as an entrepreneur it&rsquo;s important to know when to &ldquo;go against the grain.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I always think about my life and my story about being about passion, at the end of the day, and always fighting for it,&rdquo; Kadakia said. &ldquo;When I was at school I had to fight for a way to keep dance in my life. Once I graduated, I fought for a way to keep dance in my life and with ClassPass I believe I&rsquo;m fighting for everyone else to keep their passion in their life.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Hear more from Payal Kadakia on episode #118 of the <a href=\"http://abcn.ws/nolimits\" target=\"_blank\">&ldquo;No Limits with Rebecca Jarvis&rdquo;</a> <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/serial\" target=\"_blank\">podcast</a>.</em></p></p>",
