GRRM said the main characters have more or less the same fate, the secondary characters may not. gendry on the show had to survive for house baratheon cause they didn\u2019t have any back up bastards. the books have plenty and tbh the most likely to assume that role is edric storm not necessarily gendry. i think edric would have to be dead first before they give storm\u2019s end to gendry.\u00a0</p><p>if arya and gendry reunite in the books, a similar scenario plays out as 8x01-02 (maybe not as sexual due to her younger age in the books or maybe GRRM does the time jump after all idk), they\u2019re falling in love, she\u2019s starting to reconnect with her humanity and she wants to choose life over death.. only for him to die tragically. i mean bitch i would be done with this shit, i could 100% understand abandoning everything and frodo\u2019ing myself to the west. in the show, arya is leaving her family and friends for no reason. in the book, if that plays out, she\u2019d really just have the worst most nihilistic outlook on life cause the people she loves will always die on her.\u00a0</p><p>anyways, we all know GRRM is a sadistic fucker who makes us wanna die but it always makes sense in the books and it simply doesn\u2019t on the show. that\u2019s sort of my way of rationalizing this ending tbh.\u00a0</p>",

        "answer": "<p>I\u2019ve got an unpublished WIP that explores that exact idea!</p><p>Book!Arya and Book!Dany\u2019s first meeting may go badly or very well depending on the context. I think there would be some suspicion or mistrust at first based on family history. Arya won\u2019t know quite what to expect from Daenerys, especially if the stories about her vary from\u00a0\u201cliberator queen\u201d to\u00a0\u201ccrazy tyrant\u201d which they likely will. Daenerys might expect distrust and be unsure herself since she was raised to hate Ned Stark. So there may be an initial clash.

They consider this a happy ending for her. Arya redefining what it means to be a lady while running her lord husband\u2019s castle is in character for book Arya but was never even considered an option for her in the show. This is the final product of years of misunderstanding of Arya\u2019s character. I mean the whole \u201cI wanted to be a knight\u201d last season said it all.",

There was that fan who met him once and asked about Gendrya and he said something like \u201cthey have separate futures\u201d and also I think floated the idea of an Arya sequel/spinoff so all signs point to a similar ending. But if it does happen in the books, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll make a lot more sense than how it happens on the show. Also the context might be totally different- for all we know Gendry might die in the books and Edric Storm becomes Lord of Storms End and that would probably be a reasonable motivation for Arya to say fuck it all I\u2019m leaving. GRRM said secondary characters do have different book vs show fates but the main characters are mostly the same.</p>",
