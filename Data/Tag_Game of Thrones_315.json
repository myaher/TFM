        "body": "<img src=\"http://ifttt.com/images/no_image_card.png\"/><br/><div class=\"md\"><p>After giving it some thought, I firmly believe that he lost on purpose. Here&rsquo;s why.</p> <p><strong>First</strong> off, the idea of being a great fighter has been challenged in GoT. There seems to be a consistent dilemma that states that the better fighter does not necessarily win - and ultimately the better fighter is the one who ends up winning, like with how Bronn is accused of fighting dirty and Oberyn losing to the Mountain. So I believe that in context, Arthur Dayne&rsquo;s death was too cheap compared to his reputation. Especially considering that even from the start, Arthur Dayne and his companions were wildly better fighters than Ned Stark&rsquo;s crew. If Arthur Dayne and his friends were accepted by everyone, including people like George Martin, The Three-Eyed Raven and Jamie Lannister as the greatest fighters to ever walk the earth, then they would not be dying to Howland Reed. No, I believe that if in the GoT world, this man is accepted by all to be the G.O.A.T, then he would be unkillable through such cheap-shots, which shouldn&rsquo;t even be that unexpected to Dayne who, being who he is, would know that Reed did not die or receive a major injury and continues to be a potential threat in that fight if he completely ignores him.</p> <p><strong>Secondly</strong>, there is no point in Arthur Dayne winning. Many more soldiers would come even if he defeated Ned. However, if anyone found out that Lyanna had a baby, they would kill him because he is the heir of Rhaegar. So if Arthur Dayne kills Ned Stark and dies afterwards, which eventually he would, then the baby dies. If he runs, he&rsquo;d have to live in exile and how far can he run when Lyanna is about to die and he has to carry a baby? If he leaves Lyanna like that, people would know she gave birth and the baby is missing along with Arthur Dayne, whom I imagine is a very recognizable face in the seven kingdoms. So for Jon to live, Arthur Dayne and the other Kingsguard had to die. However, had they left all of Ned&rsquo;s crew alive, too many people would know about Jon. So, two were left alive. The uncle and an explanation on how Arthur Dayne lost to Ned Stark.</p> <p><strong>Thirdly</strong>, what possible reason could Arthur Dayne have to fight Ned Stark if not to feed the belief that Lyanna was kidnapped? Dayne, Rhaegar and obviously Lyanna all knew that Lyanna was not kidnapped. Why fight Ned in the first place? Lyanna was never a prisoner. Ned was not going to hurt his sister or her baby. Why fight him? </p> <p><strong>Fourth</strong> - Rhaegar would never want Ned Stark dead. Rhaegar would have known that Ned would come for Lyanna. Would he actually want his men to murder his wife&rsquo;s brother? Rhaegar aside, Lyanna would never approve of this. This is the equavilent of say Arya&rsquo;s loving husband killing Robb Stark to protect Arya. This makes no sense.</p> <p><strong>Fifth</strong>, the fact that Ned knows where they are. Why does he know this? The theory is that the Starks tortured Rhaegar&rsquo;s men and made them talk. Why would Rhaegar&rsquo;s men know about this if that&rsquo;s the only way Lyanna would not be safe? </p> <p><strong>Sixth</strong>, Ned was the only way Jon got to live. Rhaegar knows he will probably die on the battlefield, Lyanna after a point knows she&rsquo;s not going to make it. So what&rsquo;s the plan here for them? Have Arthur Dayne kill the uncle and run around the seven kingdoms with a newborn baby strapped next to his sword? No. They have to give the baby to somebody. Rhaegar, Lyanna, Arthur Dayne and the two other men sworn to protect Rhaegar are sitting on a table, deciding what they will do with the baby. Even if Lyanna lives, she can not let anyone know the baby is hers. So they have to give it to somebody. Obviously, Lyanna suggests here that Ned is a honorable man and he will take care of Jon like he&rsquo;s his own. Everyone on that table likes and respects Ned and he is the uncle afterall, so they all decide that Ned will take it and say its his bastard. </p> <p><strong>Finally</strong>, the obvious wishing Ned good fortune in the wars to come when it should, on paper be a major mismatch that Arthur Dayne and his friends would never be expected to lose. People say this is a sign of respect when in reality there are no irregularities in speech in the GoT world where people use some idioms more differently than we are accustomed to. Mance Ryder said this to Stannis when in fact he knew that Stannis had many wars to come, it was very fitting. Arthur Dayne, being who he is should know for a fact that he&rsquo;s looking at a dead man. Why wish him good fortune in the &ldquo;Wars to come&rdquo;, instead of just wishing him good fortune in that one? He would literally have to be mocking Ned. Can anyone state that the Sword of the Morning, along with 2 of the deadliest fighters in the seven kingdoms, who are confident enough to say that Robert would be dead had they been at the battle, would actually believe they would lose 3 vs 6 while defending stairs against 4 squires, a scrub and the mediocrity of Ned Stark?</p> <p>No. They clearly all died on purpose. They wanted to fight the war but Rhaegar told them they were all going to die anyway but if they died defending the Tower of Joy, there was a chance that they would save their prince, Jon.</p> </div><br/><br/>\nSource: <a href=\"https://ift.tt/2zmH7Cr\">https://ift.tt/2zmH7Cr</a>",
