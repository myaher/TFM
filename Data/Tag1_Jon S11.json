In an episode that finally admits <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/6/26/12029644/winds-of-winter-recap-jon-snow-parents\">R + L = J</a>, the music legitimizes Jon Snow as a Stark in ways that neither Sansa nor even Lady Lyanna Mormont can. It&rsquo;s as strong an endorsement of the Starks (and Jon&rsquo;s claim) as you could ever hope to get.</p><p>I was tickled, too, at how perfectly the more sinister parts of the Game of Thrones main theme mapped onto close-ups during this scene. Take this shot of Sansa smiling &mdash; she&rsquo;s apparently pleased that Jon has been embraced by the northern lords (this episode confirmed that, despite her wisdom not to trust Littlefinger, she is indeed mostly <a href=\"http://theweek.com/articles/631406/game-thrones-sansa-problem\">Dim Sansa</a>).</p><p>But when the music goes into that low ominous sequence at the very end, her gaze turns toward the camera &mdash; towards us, that is &mdash; effectively turning us into Littlefinger, whose eye she catches.<br /></p><p>That final turn in the main theme at 1:05:50 coincides with this image of Littlefinger looking not at all happy.<br /></p><p>And that incredible percussive ending of the main theme &mdash; that moment that for viewers signals that the credits are finally over and the show is about to start &mdash; coincides with Sansa&rsquo;s expression changing as she recognizes the danger:<br /></p><p>The music continues just long enough to take us to the Lannisters &mdash; specifically, to Jamie:<br /></p><p>It&rsquo;s gone by the time Jamie sees the wreckage: The Lannister music tells a very different story from the Stark score in this episode.<br /></p></blockquote><p><b><a href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/632709/why-real-winner-game-thrones-season-finale-music\">Why the real winner of the Game of Thronesseason finale was the music</a></b></p></p>",

That\u2019s the moment for Sansa which I most want to read from Martin. It\u2019s not going to be the same, of course, but I\u2019m waiting for that first time in years Sansa will feel safe and I hope that first time is still with Jon. They were definitely not close, but she\u2019s just happy to see family. She wouldn\u2019t guess how she would have that with Jon, the one she wouldn\u2019t even address as her brother. I guess it\u2019s going to feel like she\u2019s free at last, like she\u2019s waking up from a nightmare. A lot is still going to happen, but the feeling of being around family, someone she\u2019s sure she can trust, that\u2019s just freeing, the sigh we get from it. And probably Jon will feel something similar, having woken up from death, having been bretrayed and living amongst those who murdered him, even those who he thought he could trust he can\u2019t trust anymore. And it will be like he has purpose again: protecting her. But I just want to have that moment from Sansa\u2019s POV. She\u2019ll have the oportunity to finally express how she feels having taken for granted all the things she took for granted during the long summer of her childhood and teenage years. There\u2019s nothing worst than regretting and not being able to say sorry to the people we value and love, and tell them how we\u2019ve changed and have their approval. She was just a child, no one should really blame her, but I bet she feels like she needs to hear that from them. And getting that from Jon will feel sort of like getting that from Ned, since the boys were closer to him, absorbed his morals and Jon even looks like him, and that\u2019s just all sorts of <i>feels, </i>she watched her father die and probably still blames herself. That absolvation is what will possibly get her to feel like she deserves to be <i>Queen in the North</i> and truly understand her worth in a new level. Ughh I need <b>Winds of Winter </b>so bad.</p>",
