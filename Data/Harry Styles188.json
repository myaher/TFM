I\u2019ve been having a major writers block moment but today, inspiration hit\nand here is PART NINETEEN! HOW CRAZY IS THAT?! ** </p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"750\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b9c916c3c07ed5533a8cd16f23671909/tumblr_inline_pi8ieyig8P1tr3a1t_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"750\"/></figure><!-- more --><p>Harry walked into the room that had become a double office\nfor him and [Y/N], wearing only his boxers and a baggy white hoodie. The only\nsounds that could be heard were the sounds of the keys being pressed on [Y/N]\u2019s\nlaptop and the padding of Harry\u2019s feet on the wooden floor of the office. [Y/N]\nlooked up from her computer screen and smiled at her boyfriend, removing her\nglasses momentarily to rub at her eyes. Harry sat on his computer chair and\nwheeled over to his love\u2019s desks and rest his legs on the edge of it. </p><p>\u201cMy mum wants to know if we want to go and spend the weekend\nat her house.\u201d [Y/N] quickly signed off the email that she\u2019d been writing,\nbefore making sure that her meeting with a decorator was booked fully for the\nweek after.</p><p>\u201cThat would be nice, I\u2019ve missed her. Do you want to go\ntomorrow then? Stay until Sunday?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah if that\u2019s all good?\u201d [Y/N] nodded before smiling at\nher boyfriend, her eyes closing for a few seconds before opening again and\nlooking at Harry fully. \u201cTake a break, babe. You\u2019ve been in here since 7:30 and\nit\u2019s already 3. Come and have an hour nap with me or something.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t sweets. I\u2019ve got a Skype meeting with a caterer for\nthe Christmas party. I\u2019ll not be long, actually I could do with you being here\nwith me for it, it\u2019s your Christmas party after all.\u201d Harry wheeled so he was\nin front of [Y/N], his hands coming to rest on her knees. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you, it\u2019s not MY party, it\u2019s OURS now! You live\nhere with me. Also, a caterer? Two months before the party? It\u2019s not even been\nHalloween yet.\u201d [Y/N] shook her head while chuckling lightly. </p><p>\u201cBaby, you\u2019re funny. This is the first of what will turn\ninto 4 or 5 meetings sweets. We\u2019ve got today\u2019s which is going over the kind of\nfoods we want to have there, then the next one they\u2019ll go through a menu of\nthings and see what we like or don\u2019t like. The third we\u2019ll actually meet up and\ntaste the food.\u201d Harry\u2019s eyes lit up at the sound of a food tasting session.\n\u201cFinally, the week before the party we\u2019ll have one final tasting session just\nto make sure that everything is good. Then that meeting we\u2019ll also go through\nthe set up for the food and things. This will happen for the decorators too.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou are absolutely amazing at what you do, my love. How\nlong until the meeting with them?\u201d [Y/N] double checked her diary before\nletting Harry know that it wouldn\u2019t be for another ten minutes so if he needed\na wee to go now. \u201cI\u2019ll be back shortly.\u201d He planted a kiss on his girlfriend\u2019s\nlips before walking out of the room. </p><p>A few minutes later Harry walked back into the office,\nwearing a plain black top and carrying two mugs with him. </p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not having a nap then you\u2019re going to enjoy this\ncup of coffee that your insanely hot boyfriend has brought for you to drink\nwhile we talk to the caterers about our Christmas party menu. Can we get them\nto make glazed pigs in blankets on sticks?\u201d </p><p>[Y/N] took the mug from Harry\u2019s hands and took a sip of the\ncoffee, letting the hot liquid burn her throat as she did. Harry sat on his\nchair and wheeled it around the table, so they were sat next to one another and\nready to start the Skype meeting. </p><p>\u201cOh my insanely hot boyfriend knows the way to my heart!\nThank you!\u201d Once she\u2019d placed her drink on the desk, she turned to Harry and\nkissed his lips quickly. \u201cAnd yeah, we can have glazed pigs in blankets, my\nlove.\u201d</p><p>*** </p><p>When their alarm went off the following morning, [Y/N] was\nthe first to wake up. Once she\u2019d turned the alarm off, she turned over so she\nwas facing him. His face was pushed into the pillow, his lips pouting ever so\nslightly and his hair falling over his eyes. She brought her hand up to brush\nhis hair away and pressed her lips to his to try and wake him up. </p><p>\u201cBaby? We need to get up so we can go and see your mum.\u201d When\nHarry didn\u2019t budge from his sleep, [Y/N] moved her hand so the back of it was\nagainst the soft skin of his cheek. Her fingers brushed at his face softly,\nwatching as his breathing became a little ragged. \u201cI know you\u2019re awake, sleepy\nhead.\u201d His lips lifted into a small, almost unnoticeable smirk. </p><p>\u201c\u2019m not awake, dunno what you mean, angel.\u201d Harry sunk\nfurther into the pillow underneath his head, bringing his arms to wrap around \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0[Y/N]\u2019s waist to pull her into his hard\nchest. The pair lay for a few moments basking in one another\u2019s presence,\nwanting nothing more than for the moment to never end. </p><p>\u201cCome on, gorgeous. We have to get up and get going. You\npromised me a McDonald\u2019s breakfast before we left and it\u2019s already 9am!\u201d She\ntried to pull herself from Harry\u2019s grasp, only to be pulled even closer to him,\nher front hitting his with a thump and a groan. </p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t leaving his bed until I get at least one kissy\nfrom you. Then we can get up and get ready to go, promise.\u201d His eyes opened and\n[Y/N]\u2019s thumb came to wipe away the sleep that had formed in the corners of\nthem over night. Her hands rest on his jawline, and her thumbs rubbed at his\ncheekbones as she leaned in to press her lips against Harry\u2019s. She pulled away\nbut Harry brought his hands up to rest at her neck, pulling her in for more. \u201cI\nsaid at least one, I\u2019ve got another good one for you right,\u201d he pulled his\nforehead away from hers to look into her eyes, and then proceeded to move his\nlips back toward hers, \u201chere.\u201d When their lips touched again, they both moved\nimpossibly close to the other, their breaths becoming one. </p><p>When they finally parted, they were both gasping for breath\nand smiling widely. The both of them stretched their bodies before standing\nfrom the bed, tired eyes on the both of them. Harry walked into the closet\nwhile [Y/N] walked to turn the shower on so she could clean her body before\ntheir long car journey. Before stepping under the hot water, she brushed her\nteeth and got the shower products she wanted to use ready. </p><p>\u201cHey, mind if I join you?\u201d [Y/N] looked through the shower\ndoor to see Harry stood in just his boxers with a smile on his face. \u201cNo funny\nbusiness, I just can\u2019t be bothered waiting for you to finish.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI guess, but no funny business! And don\u2019t get my hair wet,\nI only washed it last night.\u201d Harry stepped into the shower and stepped under\nthe water, making his girlfriend move out of the stream of the water; causing\nher to groan loudly. \u201cIT\u2019S COLD NOT BEING UNDER THERE!\u201d </p><p>\u201cHere, turn around so your back is against me.\u201d While she\nturned around, Harry grabbed the shower gel and loofa before lathering it up.\n\u201cI\u2019ll wash you. Just stand here and keep warm.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThank you gorgeous.\u201d </p><p>*** </p><p>\u201cCHAAAIIIIIIIN, KEEP US TOGETHER!!\u201d The car was filled with\nthe sounds of Fleetwood Mac playing, and laughter from the two people. Harry\nturned the dial in the car to turn the music down, taking his eyes off the road\nfor a second to look at his girlfriend. </p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t be long until we\u2019re there, ladybug.\u201d [Y/N]\u2019s hand\nfumbled around to grab onto Harry\u2019s, bringing it up to kiss lovingly. Harry\nthen brought [Y/N]\u2019s hand up to kiss too, a smile plastered on both of their\nfaces as they did. Their hands retreated to rest on [Y/N]\u2019s leg, not untangling\nfrom one another as they did so. </p><p>\u201cGood, my bum is starting to go numb from sitting here for\nso long.\u201d A soft chuckle was shared between the two people before the car fell\nquiet once more, Fleetwood Mac still playing through the speakers at a reduced\nvolume. </p><p>The rest of the car ride was silent, comfortably so, but\nstill silent. Harry would steal glances at his girlfriend, and smirked when she\ncaught him staring. As they pulled up to Anne\u2019s house, [Y/N] saw the woman\nwho\u2019d given her the best boyfriend standing at the door, a large smile similar\nto Harry\u2019s adorning her face. </p><p>Anne walked toward the car once it stopped and rather than\nsaying hello to her son, she walked over to his girlfriend and embraced her\ntightly, telling her how much she\u2019d missed her and was happy to see her again.\nHarry stood to the side, a loving smile on his face as he watched two of his\nfavourite women hugging and smiling together. Once the hug broke, his mum\nopened her arms for him and he walked straight into them, leaning down to be at\nher level and holding her just as tightly as she was holding him. [Y/N] brought\nher hand up and placed it upon Harry\u2019s which sat on his mother\u2019s back, enjoying\nthe love that was radiating from the pair. </p><p>\u201cCome on you two, let\u2019s get you inside where it\u2019s warm. You\nstill drink coffee, right lovely?\u201d [Y/N] could see Harry chuckled besides her\nas she replied to the woman who raised her boyfriend. </p><p>\u201cOnly with my oxygen.\u201d Anne laughed at her response before\nwalking them into the kitchen of her home and placing a hot coffee in front of\neach of them. \u201cOh you are an actual superstar! Thank you.\u201d The first sip of\ncoffee hit [Y/N]\u2019s throat and she closed her eyes in bliss. Coffee had been the\nthing that got her through so many days but now she\u2019d grown to just love the\ntaste, and feeling it gave her when she drank it, no longer needing it for the\nenergy. </p><p>The three people walked through the house and into Anne\u2019s\nliving room, where the TV played a Strictly Come Dancing rerun quietly. As Harry\nand [Y/N] sat on the smaller of the sofas that sat in the room, Harry pulled\nhis girlfriend into him and draped her legs over his own, using his hands to\nrub at her calves while she rest her head on his shoulder. </p><p>\u201cHow\u2019ve you been, Anne? It seems like it\u2019s been ages since I\nlast saw you.\u201d Anne placed her mug of tea on the coffee table before smiling at\nthe two people in front of her. Though she would never admit it, she was\nsceptical when Harry had told her that he\u2019d met a girl in Starbucks and that she\u2019d\nbeen a fan; sceptical that the girl was only wanting to date him because he was\nHarry Styles; and sceptical that Harry\u2019s heart would be broken. But seeing the\ntwo of them in front of her, Harry\u2019s eyes flicking to his girlfriend every now\nand then to make sure she was still there, and his lips not being able to stay\nin a straight line whenever he did, she knew that they were good together, and\nthat they were happy. Harry was happy, and she was happy that he was happy.\nShe\u2019d grown to love [Y/N] like a daughter and knew that it wasn\u2019t about the\nfame, but that she really, truly loved Harry and Anne couldn\u2019t be more\ngrateful. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been good thank you sweets. Really good.\u201d She smiled\nat [Y/N], who had placed her hand on Harry\u2019s which were resting on her legs at\nthat point. \u201cWhat are your plans for the next few weeks?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI have graduation in three weeks and then Harry flies out\nto LA for Halloween the day after. I\u2019ll be having meetings regarding the\nChristmas party and then I have to meet up with my boss to decide what\u2019s\nhappening next year and where we want to take things. Feel free to come down\nfor a bit while Harry\u2019s swanning it in the sun, if you\u2019d like!\u201d Harry smiled at\nhis mum, too wrapped up in his thoughts that he hadn\u2019t heard her speak to him. </p><p>\u201cSorry, what was that?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou really are ridiculous sometimes. I asked why you\u2019re in\nLA.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the Casamigo\u2019s Halloween party, and then I have to\nhave a few meetings with Jeff to discuss the new album. I\u2019ll only be gone for a\nweek or two. Then it\u2019ll be back home to my gorgeous girlfriend and planning\nChristmas.\u201d [Y/N]\u2019s cheeks heated as Harry called her gorgeous, and she lightly\nkissed his shoulder as he grabbed her hand. \u201cBut, [Y/N], don\u2019t forget that when\nI\u2019m in LA Liv is coming for a couple of days.\u201d [Y/N]\u2019s eyes widened at the\nrealisation before turning to Anne. </p><p>\u201cI forgot she was coming! You\u2019re still more than welcome.\nGems could come too, and we\u2019ll have a proper girly day!\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat would be lovely, dear.\u201d </p><p>***</p><p>After lunch, Harry and [Y/N] had gone upstairs to unpack\ntheir bags while Anne popped to the shops to get a few bits for their evening\nmeal. When she returned to the house, the couple weren\u2019t downstairs and so she\nwalked up to Harry\u2019s bedroom to see if they were there. The door was ajar\nslightly and as she peered around it, she saw her son and his girlfriend\nunderneath the covers, with their foreheads touching, fast asleep. Even though\nthey were covered by a thin sheet, she could see the outline of Harry\u2019s hand\nresting upon [Y/N]\u2019s hip. She smiled at the view before taking a quick photo-purely\nto show the two later on in the day-and leaving the room, closing the door\nbehind her as to not wake them up when she started to cook. </p><p>An hour later, [Y/N] walked through to the kitchen with\ntired eyes and a smile plastered on her face. Anne had Queen playing through\nher speaker while she made the lasagne for their dinner. When she heard someone\nat the door, she turned around with a smile and ushered the younger girl into\nthe kitchen and to sit on one of the stools at the island. </p><p>\u201cDid you have a nice nap?\u201d [Y/N] nodded, while yawning and\nrubbing at her eyes. </p><p>\u201cI did thank you. I blame your son for this by the way, he\u2019s\ngot me into the habit of having a nap every now and then, but I hate it. It\nmakes me feel so unproductive.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a nuisance like that. He\u2019s always been the same too,\nhaving a quick hour nap through the day. But then he wonders why he can\u2019t sleep\non a night.\u201d [Y/N]\u2019s head nodded quickly, as if to prove that she really did\nagree. </p><p>\u201cThat happens every time he takes a nap! But if I haven\u2019t\nhad one and could fall asleep easily, he\u2019ll talk to me until I\u2019m no longer\nsleep then we\u2019re both awake for hours longer than necessary. It\u2019s a good job I\nlove him.\u201d Anne smiled at that, knowing that Harry really was loved, and it\nwasn\u2019t just a show. The way it so easily fell from [Y/N]\u2019s mouth made her\nrealise even more that what the two shared was real. </p><p>\u201cYou really do love him, don\u2019t you? This isn\u2019t a short-term\nthing.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI hope it isn\u2019t a short-term thing, in my eyes I know that Harry\nis it for me. I assure you that I will do everything in my power to make Harry\nthe happiest I can. He came into my life when it was hectic, and even though he\u2019s\na busy man himself, he was willing to spend as much time as he could with me\nwhen I wasn\u2019t trying to write essays and get everything sent off, so I can\ngraduate.\u201d [Y/N] smiled at the top of the island remembering everything she\u2019s\ngone through with Harry. \u201cWhen he goes away, even if it\u2019s just for a couple of\nhours to go to an interview, or if he has a meeting, my heart physically aches\nuntil he comes home and hugs me. Sometimes I feel weird and that he thinks I\u2019m\ntoo clingy.\u201d Anne stayed silent, so she could hear the rest of what [Y/N] was\nsaying, the smile on her face never dimming. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him perform a couple of\ntimes but when I saw him do the gig in LA for a few people, I came to realise\njust how utterly proud I am of him. He gives his all to everything he does and\nseeing him performing just makes me heart swell even more. It\u2019s the little things\nthat make me realise how much I love him, the way he will hold eye contact\nwhile I\u2019m talking, even if I\u2019m looking a different way, the way he just grabs my\nhand when we\u2019re sat down, and draws patterns on it; the way that when he wakes\nup in the middle of the night he\u2019ll grab onto my waist and pull me even closer\nto him, with his nose pressed to the back of my neck as he drifts back off into\nsleep; and mainly, the love he has, and shows for you. He loves me, but he\nhonestly adores you! He tells me all the time that he loves you and I realise\nthat you are number one in his life, but that is completely fine with me. You\u2019ve\nbrought the most loving, respectful, trustworthy man into the world and I love\nyou for that.\u201d </p><p>\u201c[Y/N], you have no idea how lovely that was to hear. Can I\ntell you something?\u201d </p><p> \u201cOf course.\u201d It was\nalmost a whisper, her voice wavering as the nerves hit her. </p><p>\u201cThe day that Harry called me and told me that he\u2019d met a\ngirl in Starbucks and that she\u2019d been a fan of his for a while, I got so scared\nthat the girl was in it for the money, and the fame of being linked with \u2018Harry\nStyles\u2019,\u201d Anne made air quotes around her son\u2019s name, while [Y/N] came to\nrealise that the girl Anne was talking about, was her. \u201cI\u2019ve known for a while\nthat it wasn\u2019t the case, but hearing you tell me all of those things, and\nseeing you and Harry together, I realise how stupid I was to ever think that. I\nlove you and I love that you love Harry.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI have never thought of Harry as anything but \u2018Harry\u2019. My\nmind has never gone \u2018Oh my days I\u2019m dating Harry Styles\u2019, it\u2019s \u2018oh my days, I\u2019m\ndating Harry, and I love him\u2019. Harry is the most down to earth, loving man that\nhas ever walked the earth. He\u2019s the man who loves his family more than anything\nand would do literally anything for them. Your son is the best thing that has\never happened to me, and the world; so yeah, I was a fan before I met him, but\nnow I\u2019m his fan in a completely different way.\u201d</p><p>[Y/N] stood up from her place and let Anne\u2019s arms wrap\naround her. They stood in a hug for five minutes before Harry walked into the\nkitchen and looked at the two women curiously. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d Anne let go of [Y/N] and walked back\nto the oven while [Y/N] walked to Harry, wrapping her arms around him and\nnesting her face in his neck. </p><p>\u201cNothing, feel better after your nap?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI do for now, until later when I can\u2019t sleep.\u201d Everyone in\nthe room laughed and as it died down, Anne could be heard to hum happily. She\nturned around to see Harry pressing his lips to [Y/N]\u2019s, pulling away quickly\nand smiling at her with his eyes being slightly narrowed due to his cheeks\nrising with the smile. </p><p>*** </p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s [Y/N]?\u201d Harry sat on the sofa next to his mum,\nbringing his phone out of his pocket so he could sit comfortably. </p><p>\u201cOh, she\u2019s just having a quick shower, she\u2019ll be down in twenty\nminutes or so. Can we have a chat please?\u201d Anne placed her mug on the coffee\ntable and turned her body, so she was facing her son, her hands on her knees\nand her head tilted slightly. </p><p>\u201cOf course! What\u2019s bothering you?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHow do you know that you\u2019re in love? Like, when it\u2019s the\nreal deal and you want it to last forever?\u201d Harry looked straight into his mum\u2019s\neyes, hoping to get her true reaction. What he couldn\u2019t see were the thoughts\nthat went through her mind. Her conversation with [Y/N] replaying in her head. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s making you ask this?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got something to do but I just want to be sure that\nwhat I\u2019m feeling is what I think it is.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou know you\u2019re in love when the first person that comes to\nmind when you do anything, is them. When you can close your eyes and picture\nthem sat smiling at you; when they\u2019re happiness means everything to you and you\nwould do anything you could to make them happy; when if you aren\u2019t with them\nyou want to be with them, even if they\u2019re only in the room next to you; and\nwhen any time their name is spoken, you immediately smile and your heart starts\nbeating faster because you\u2019re excited. Being in love is something that you do\nhave to work on though, and it isn\u2019t always sunshine. You have blips when you\u2019re\nin love, but it\u2019s the love you share that means you can\u2019t walk away.\u201d Anne looked\nat Harry, who had a serious look on his face, playing with the rings on his\nfingers and his knee bouncing fast. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d </p><p>Harry didn\u2019t respond, the silence in the room almost deafening\nto Anne, who worried that Harry was going to tell her that he was no longer in\nlove with the girl who was upstairs, and that he was going to end things with\nher. She knew it wasn\u2019t fair to think that but when Harry had been silent for a\nfew seconds, scrolling through his phone, she feared the worst. Until Harry\nturned his phone around and showed her the screen he was on. </p><p>\u201cI love her mum. She is the love of my life and I\u2019ve known\nfor a while now. I know we\u2019ve only been in a relationship for seven months, but\nwe were dating for three months before that. I love her more than I love myself\nand I want her to be by my side for the rest of my life, every day I want to\nsee her, and only her. I want to wake up next to her on a morning, I want to\nhave children with her, I want to travel with her and I want to grow old with\nher. She\u2019s my everything.\u201d </p><p>The light blue box sat in his underwear drawer, underneath\nall of them where he knew no one would see it. The photo he was showing Anne had\nthe box open, a soleste cut, white gold ring, with the words \u2018all my love, H\u2019\nengraved on the underside of it. He couldn\u2019t help the smile on his face as he\nwatched his mum\u2019s eyes widen, then glisten as tears threatened to spill. </p><p>\u201cI want to ask her to marry me.\u201d </p>",

The only\nsounds that could be heard were the sounds of the keys being pressed on [Y/N]\u2019s\nlaptop and the padding of Harry\u2019s feet on the wooden floor of the office. [Y/N]\nlooked up from her computer screen and smiled at her boyfriend, removing her\nglasses momentarily to rub at her eyes. Harry sat on his computer chair and\nwheeled over to his love\u2019s desks and rest his legs on the edge of it. </p><p>\u201cMy mum wants to know if we want to go and spend the weekend\nat her house.\u201d [Y/N] quickly signed off the email that she\u2019d been writing,\nbefore making sure that her meeting with a decorator was booked fully for the\nweek after.</p><p>\u201cThat would be nice, I\u2019ve missed her. Do you want to go\ntomorrow then? Stay until Sunday?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah if that\u2019s all good?\u201d [Y/N] nodded before smiling at\nher boyfriend, her eyes closing for a few seconds before opening again and\nlooking at Harry fully. \u201cTake a break, babe. You\u2019ve been in here since 7:30 and\nit\u2019s already 3. Come and have an hour nap with me or something.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t sweets. I\u2019ve got a Skype meeting with a caterer for\nthe Christmas party. I\u2019ll not be long, actually I could do with you being here\nwith me for it, it\u2019s your Christmas party after all.\u201d Harry wheeled so he was\nin front of [Y/N], his hands coming to rest on her knees. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you, it\u2019s not MY party, it\u2019s OURS now! You live\nhere with me. Also, a caterer? Two months before the party? It\u2019s not even been\nHalloween yet.\u201d [Y/N] shook her head while chuckling lightly. </p><p>\u201cBaby, you\u2019re funny. This is the first of what will turn\ninto 4 or 5 meetings sweets. We\u2019ve got today\u2019s which is going over the kind of\nfoods we want to have there, then the next one they\u2019ll go through a menu of\nthings and see what we like or don\u2019t like. The third we\u2019ll actually meet up and\ntaste the food.\u201d Harry\u2019s eyes lit up at the sound of a food tasting session.\n\u201cFinally, the week before the party we\u2019ll have one final tasting session just\nto make sure that everything is good. Then that meeting we\u2019ll also go through\nthe set up for the food and things. This will happen for the decorators too.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou are absolutely amazing at what you do, my love. How\nlong until the meeting with them?\u201d [Y/N] double checked her diary before\nletting Harry know that it wouldn\u2019t be for another ten minutes so if he needed\na wee to go now. \u201cI\u2019ll be back shortly.\u201d He planted a kiss on his girlfriend\u2019s\nlips before walking out of the room. </p><p>A few minutes later Harry walked back into the office,\nwearing a plain black top and carrying two mugs with him. </p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not having a nap then you\u2019re going to enjoy this\ncup of coffee that your insanely hot boyfriend has brought for you to drink\nwhile we talk to the caterers about our Christmas party menu. Can we get them\nto make glazed pigs in blankets on sticks?\u201d </p><p>[Y/N] took the mug from Harry\u2019s hands and took a sip of the\ncoffee, letting the hot liquid burn her throat as she did. Harry sat on his\nchair and wheeled it around the table, so they were sat next to one another and\nready to start the Skype meeting. </p><p>\u201cOh my insanely hot boyfriend knows the way to my heart!\nThank you!\u201d Once she\u2019d placed her drink on the desk, she turned to Harry and\nkissed his lips quickly. \u201cAnd yeah, we can have glazed pigs in blankets, my\nlove.\u201d</p><p>*** </p><p>When their alarm went off the following morning, [Y/N] was\nthe first to wake up. Once she\u2019d turned the alarm off, she turned over so she\nwas facing him. His face was pushed into the pillow, his lips pouting ever so\nslightly and his hair falling over his eyes. She brought her hand up to brush\nhis hair away and pressed her lips to his to try and wake him up. </p><p>\u201cBaby? We need to get up so we can go and see your mum.\u201d When\nHarry didn\u2019t budge from his sleep, [Y/N] moved her hand so the back of it was\nagainst the soft skin of his cheek. Her fingers brushed at his face softly,\nwatching as his breathing became a little ragged. \u201cI know you\u2019re awake, sleepy\nhead.\u201d His lips lifted into a small, almost unnoticeable smirk. </p><p>\u201c\u2019m not awake, dunno what you mean, angel.\u201d Harry sunk\nfurther into the pillow underneath his head, bringing his arms to wrap around \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0[Y/N]\u2019s waist to pull her into his hard\nchest. The pair lay for a few moments basking in one another\u2019s presence,\nwanting nothing more than for the moment to never end. </p><p>\u201cCome on, gorgeous. We have to get up and get going. You\npromised me a McDonald\u2019s breakfast before we left and it\u2019s already 9am!\u201d She\ntried to pull herself from Harry\u2019s grasp, only to be pulled even closer to him,\nher front hitting his with a thump and a groan. </p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t leaving his bed until I get at least one kissy\nfrom you. Then we can get up and get ready to go, promise.\u201d His eyes opened and\n[Y/N]\u2019s thumb came to wipe away the sleep that had formed in the corners of\nthem over night. Her hands rest on his jawline, and her thumbs rubbed at his\ncheekbones as she leaned in to press her lips against Harry\u2019s. She pulled away\nbut Harry brought his hands up to rest at her neck, pulling her in for more. \u201cI\nsaid at least one, I\u2019ve got another good one for you right,\u201d he pulled his\nforehead away from hers to look into her eyes, and then proceeded to move his\nlips back toward hers, \u201chere.\u201d When their lips touched again, they both moved\nimpossibly close to the other, their breaths becoming one. </p><p>When they finally parted, they were both gasping for breath\nand smiling widely. The both of them stretched their bodies before standing\nfrom the bed, tired eyes on the both of them. Harry walked into the closet\nwhile [Y/N] walked to turn the shower on so she could clean her body before\ntheir long car journey. Before stepping under the hot water, she brushed her\nteeth and got the shower products she wanted to use ready. </p><p>\u201cHey, mind if I join you?\u201d [Y/N] looked through the shower\ndoor to see Harry stood in just his boxers with a smile on his face. \u201cNo funny\nbusiness, I just can\u2019t be bothered waiting for you to finish.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI guess, but no funny business! And don\u2019t get my hair wet,\nI only washed it last night.\u201d Harry stepped into the shower and stepped under\nthe water, making his girlfriend move out of the stream of the water; causing\nher to groan loudly. \u201cIT\u2019S COLD NOT BEING UNDER THERE!\u201d </p><p>\u201cHere, turn around so your back is against me.\u201d While she\nturned around, Harry grabbed the shower gel and loofa before lathering it up.\n\u201cI\u2019ll wash you. Just stand here and keep warm.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThank you gorgeous.\u201d </p><p>*** </p><p>\u201cCHAAAIIIIIIIN, KEEP US TOGETHER!!\u201d The car was filled with\nthe sounds of Fleetwood Mac playing, and laughter from the two people. Harry\nturned the dial in the car to turn the music down, taking his eyes off the road\nfor a second to look at his girlfriend. </p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t be long until we\u2019re there, ladybug.\u201d [Y/N]\u2019s hand\nfumbled around to grab onto Harry\u2019s, bringing it up to kiss lovingly. Harry\nthen brought [Y/N]\u2019s hand up to kiss too, a smile plastered on both of their\nfaces as they did. Their hands retreated to rest on [Y/N]\u2019s leg, not untangling\nfrom one another as they did so. </p><p>\u201cGood, my bum is starting to go numb from sitting here for\nso long.\u201d A soft chuckle was shared between the two people before the car fell\nquiet once more, Fleetwood Mac still playing through the speakers at a reduced\nvolume. </p><p>The rest of the car ride was silent, comfortably so, but\nstill silent. Harry would steal glances at his girlfriend, and smirked when she\ncaught him staring. As they pulled up to Anne\u2019s house, [Y/N] saw the woman\nwho\u2019d given her the best boyfriend standing at the door, a large smile similar\nto Harry\u2019s adorning her face. </p><p>Anne walked toward the car once it stopped and rather than\nsaying hello to her son, she walked over to his girlfriend and embraced her\ntightly, telling her how much she\u2019d missed her and was happy to see her again.\nHarry stood to the side, a loving smile on his face as he watched two of his\nfavourite women hugging and smiling together. Once the hug broke, his mum\nopened her arms for him and he walked straight into them, leaning down to be at\nher level and holding her just as tightly as she was holding him. [Y/N] brought\nher hand up and placed it upon Harry\u2019s which sat on his mother\u2019s back, enjoying\nthe love that was radiating from the pair. </p><p>\u201cCome on you two, let\u2019s get you inside where it\u2019s warm. You\nstill drink coffee, right lovely?\u201d [Y/N] could see Harry chuckled besides her\nas she replied to the woman who raised her boyfriend. </p><p>\u201cOnly with my oxygen.\u201d Anne laughed at her response before\nwalking them into the kitchen of her home and placing a hot coffee in front of\neach of them. \u201cOh you are an actual superstar! Thank you.\u201d The first sip of\ncoffee hit [Y/N]\u2019s throat and she closed her eyes in bliss. Coffee had been the\nthing that got her through so many days but now she\u2019d grown to just love the\ntaste, and feeling it gave her when she drank it, no longer needing it for the\nenergy. </p><p>The three people walked through the house and into Anne\u2019s\nliving room, where the TV played a Strictly Come Dancing rerun quietly. As Harry\nand [Y/N] sat on the smaller of the sofas that sat in the room, Harry pulled\nhis girlfriend into him and draped her legs over his own, using his hands to\nrub at her calves while she rest her head on his shoulder. </p><p>\u201cHow\u2019ve you been, Anne? It seems like it\u2019s been ages since I\nlast saw you.\u201d Anne placed her mug of tea on the coffee table before smiling at\nthe two people in front of her. Though she would never admit it, she was\nsceptical when Harry had told her that he\u2019d met a girl in Starbucks and that she\u2019d\nbeen a fan; sceptical that the girl was only wanting to date him because he was\nHarry Styles; and sceptical that Harry\u2019s heart would be broken. But seeing the\ntwo of them in front of her, Harry\u2019s eyes flicking to his girlfriend every now\nand then to make sure she was still there, and his lips not being able to stay\nin a straight line whenever he did, she knew that they were good together, and\nthat they were happy. Harry was happy, and she was happy that he was happy.\nShe\u2019d grown to love [Y/N] like a daughter and knew that it wasn\u2019t about the\nfame, but that she really, truly loved Harry and Anne couldn\u2019t be more\ngrateful. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been good thank you sweets. Really good.\u201d She smiled\nat [Y/N], who had placed her hand on Harry\u2019s which were resting on her legs at\nthat point. \u201cWhat are your plans for the next few weeks?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI have graduation in three weeks and then Harry flies out\nto LA for Halloween the day after. I\u2019ll be having meetings regarding the\nChristmas party and then I have to meet up with my boss to decide what\u2019s\nhappening next year and where we want to take things. Feel free to come down\nfor a bit while Harry\u2019s swanning it in the sun, if you\u2019d like!\u201d Harry smiled at\nhis mum, too wrapped up in his thoughts that he hadn\u2019t heard her speak to him. </p><p>\u201cSorry, what was that?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou really are ridiculous sometimes. I asked why you\u2019re in\nLA.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the Casamigo\u2019s Halloween party, and then I have to\nhave a few meetings with Jeff to discuss the new album. I\u2019ll only be gone for a\nweek or two. Then it\u2019ll be back home to my gorgeous girlfriend and planning\nChristmas.\u201d [Y/N]\u2019s cheeks heated as Harry called her gorgeous, and she lightly\nkissed his shoulder as he grabbed her hand. \u201cBut, [Y/N], don\u2019t forget that when\nI\u2019m in LA Liv is coming for a couple of days.\u201d [Y/N]\u2019s eyes widened at the\nrealisation before turning to Anne. </p><p>\u201cI forgot she was coming! You\u2019re still more than welcome.\nGems could come too, and we\u2019ll have a proper girly day!\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat would be lovely, dear.\u201d </p><p>***</p><p>After lunch, Harry and [Y/N] had gone upstairs to unpack\ntheir bags while Anne popped to the shops to get a few bits for their evening\nmeal. When she returned to the house, the couple weren\u2019t downstairs and so she\nwalked up to Harry\u2019s bedroom to see if they were there. The door was ajar\nslightly and as she peered around it, she saw her son and his girlfriend\nunderneath the covers, with their foreheads touching, fast asleep. Even though\nthey were covered by a thin sheet, she could see the outline of Harry\u2019s hand\nresting upon [Y/N]\u2019s hip. She smiled at the view before taking a quick photo-purely\nto show the two later on in the day-and leaving the room, closing the door\nbehind her as to not wake them up when she started to cook. </p><p>An hour later, [Y/N] walked through to the kitchen with\ntired eyes and a smile plastered on her face. Anne had Queen playing through\nher speaker while she made the lasagne for their dinner. When she heard someone\nat the door, she turned around with a smile and ushered the younger girl into\nthe kitchen and to sit on one of the stools at the island. </p><p>\u201cDid you have a nice nap?\u201d [Y/N] nodded, while yawning and\nrubbing at her eyes. </p><p>\u201cI did thank you. I blame your son for this by the way, he\u2019s\ngot me into the habit of having a nap every now and then, but I hate it. It\nmakes me feel so unproductive.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a nuisance like that. He\u2019s always been the same too,\nhaving a quick hour nap through the day. But then he wonders why he can\u2019t sleep\non a night.\u201d [Y/N]\u2019s head nodded quickly, as if to prove that she really did\nagree. </p><p>\u201cThat happens every time he takes a nap! But if I haven\u2019t\nhad one and could fall asleep easily, he\u2019ll talk to me until I\u2019m no longer\nsleep then we\u2019re both awake for hours longer than necessary. It\u2019s a good job I\nlove him.\u201d Anne smiled at that, knowing that Harry really was loved, and it\nwasn\u2019t just a show. The way it so easily fell from [Y/N]\u2019s mouth made her\nrealise even more that what the two shared was real. </p><p>\u201cYou really do love him, don\u2019t you? This isn\u2019t a short-term\nthing.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI hope it isn\u2019t a short-term thing, in my eyes I know that Harry\nis it for me. I assure you that I will do everything in my power to make Harry\nthe happiest I can. He came into my life when it was hectic, and even though he\u2019s\na busy man himself, he was willing to spend as much time as he could with me\nwhen I wasn\u2019t trying to write essays and get everything sent off, so I can\ngraduate.\u201d [Y/N] smiled at the top of the island remembering everything she\u2019s\ngone through with Harry. \u201cWhen he goes away, even if it\u2019s just for a couple of\nhours to go to an interview, or if he has a meeting, my heart physically aches\nuntil he comes home and hugs me. Sometimes I feel weird and that he thinks I\u2019m\ntoo clingy.\u201d Anne stayed silent, so she could hear the rest of what [Y/N] was\nsaying, the smile on her face never dimming. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him perform a couple of\ntimes but when I saw him do the gig in LA for a few people, I came to realise\njust how utterly proud I am of him. He gives his all to everything he does and\nseeing him performing just makes me heart swell even more. It\u2019s the little things\nthat make me realise how much I love him, the way he will hold eye contact\nwhile I\u2019m talking, even if I\u2019m looking a different way, the way he just grabs my\nhand when we\u2019re sat down, and draws patterns on it; the way that when he wakes\nup in the middle of the night he\u2019ll grab onto my waist and pull me even closer\nto him, with his nose pressed to the back of my neck as he drifts back off into\nsleep; and mainly, the love he has, and shows for you. He loves me, but he\nhonestly adores you! He tells me all the time that he loves you and I realise\nthat you are number one in his life, but that is completely fine with me. You\u2019ve\nbrought the most loving, respectful, trustworthy man into the world and I love\nyou for that.\u201d </p><p>\u201c[Y/N], you have no idea how lovely that was to hear. Can I\ntell you something?\u201d </p><p> \u201cOf course.\u201d It was\nalmost a whisper, her voice wavering as the nerves hit her. </p><p>\u201cThe day that Harry called me and told me that he\u2019d met a\ngirl in Starbucks and that she\u2019d been a fan of his for a while, I got so scared\nthat the girl was in it for the money, and the fame of being linked with \u2018Harry\nStyles\u2019,\u201d Anne made air quotes around her son\u2019s name, while [Y/N] came to\nrealise that the girl Anne was talking about, was her. \u201cI\u2019ve known for a while\nthat it wasn\u2019t the case, but hearing you tell me all of those things, and\nseeing you and Harry together, I realise how stupid I was to ever think that. I\nlove you and I love that you love Harry.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI have never thought of Harry as anything but \u2018Harry\u2019. My\nmind has never gone \u2018Oh my days I\u2019m dating Harry Styles\u2019, it\u2019s \u2018oh my days, I\u2019m\ndating Harry, and I love him\u2019. Harry is the most down to earth, loving man that\nhas ever walked the earth. He\u2019s the man who loves his family more than anything\nand would do literally anything for them. Your son is the best thing that has\never happened to me, and the world; so yeah, I was a fan before I met him, but\nnow I\u2019m his fan in a completely different way.\u201d</p><p>[Y/N] stood up from her place and let Anne\u2019s arms wrap\naround her. They stood in a hug for five minutes before Harry walked into the\nkitchen and looked at the two women curiously. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d Anne let go of [Y/N] and walked back\nto the oven while [Y/N] walked to Harry, wrapping her arms around him and\nnesting her face in his neck. </p><p>\u201cNothing, feel better after your nap?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI do for now, until later when I can\u2019t sleep.\u201d Everyone in\nthe room laughed and as it died down, Anne could be heard to hum happily. She\nturned around to see Harry pressing his lips to [Y/N]\u2019s, pulling away quickly\nand smiling at her with his eyes being slightly narrowed due to his cheeks\nrising with the smile. </p><p>*** </p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s [Y/N]?\u201d Harry sat on the sofa next to his mum,\nbringing his phone out of his pocket so he could sit comfortably. </p><p>\u201cOh, she\u2019s just having a quick shower, she\u2019ll be down in twenty\nminutes or so. Can we have a chat please?\u201d Anne placed her mug on the coffee\ntable and turned her body, so she was facing her son, her hands on her knees\nand her head tilted slightly. </p><p>\u201cOf course! What\u2019s bothering you?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHow do you know that you\u2019re in love? Like, when it\u2019s the\nreal deal and you want it to last forever?\u201d Harry looked straight into his mum\u2019s\neyes, hoping to get her true reaction. What he couldn\u2019t see were the thoughts\nthat went through her mind. Her conversation with [Y/N] replaying in her head. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s making you ask this?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got something to do but I just want to be sure that\nwhat I\u2019m feeling is what I think it is.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou know you\u2019re in love when the first person that comes to\nmind when you do anything, is them. When you can close your eyes and picture\nthem sat smiling at you; when they\u2019re happiness means everything to you and you\nwould do anything you could to make them happy; when if you aren\u2019t with them\nyou want to be with them, even if they\u2019re only in the room next to you; and\nwhen any time their name is spoken, you immediately smile and your heart starts\nbeating faster because you\u2019re excited. Being in love is something that you do\nhave to work on though, and it isn\u2019t always sunshine. You have blips when you\u2019re\nin love, but it\u2019s the love you share that means you can\u2019t walk away.\u201d Anne looked\nat Harry, who had a serious look on his face, playing with the rings on his\nfingers and his knee bouncing fast. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d </p><p>Harry didn\u2019t respond, the silence in the room almost deafening\nto Anne, who worried that Harry was going to tell her that he was no longer in\nlove with the girl who was upstairs, and that he was going to end things with\nher. She knew it wasn\u2019t fair to think that but when Harry had been silent for a\nfew seconds, scrolling through his phone, she feared the worst. Until Harry\nturned his phone around and showed her the screen he was on. </p><p>\u201cI love her mum. She is the love of my life and I\u2019ve known\nfor a while now. I know we\u2019ve only been in a relationship for seven months, but\nwe were dating for three months before that. I love her more than I love myself\nand I want her to be by my side for the rest of my life, every day I want to\nsee her, and only her. I want to wake up next to her on a morning, I want to\nhave children with her, I want to travel with her and I want to grow old with\nher. She\u2019s my everything.\u201d </p><p>The light blue box sat in his underwear drawer, underneath\nall of them where he knew no one would see it. The photo he was showing Anne had\nthe box open, a soleste cut, white gold ring, with the words \u2018all my love, H\u2019\nengraved on the underside of it. He couldn\u2019t help the smile on his face as he\nwatched his mum\u2019s eyes widen, then glisten as tears threatened to spill. </p><p>\u201cI want to ask her to marry me.\u201d </p>",

The only\nsounds that could be heard were the sounds of the keys being pressed on [Y/N]\u2019s\nlaptop and the padding of Harry\u2019s feet on the wooden floor of the office. [Y/N]\nlooked up from her computer screen and smiled at her boyfriend, removing her\nglasses momentarily to rub at her eyes. Harry sat on his computer chair and\nwheeled over to his love\u2019s desks and rest his legs on the edge of it. </p><p>\u201cMy mum wants to know if we want to go and spend the weekend\nat her house.\u201d [Y/N] quickly signed off the email that she\u2019d been writing,\nbefore making sure that her meeting with a decorator was booked fully for the\nweek after.</p><p>\u201cThat would be nice, I\u2019ve missed her. Do you want to go\ntomorrow then? Stay until Sunday?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah if that\u2019s all good?\u201d [Y/N] nodded before smiling at\nher boyfriend, her eyes closing for a few seconds before opening again and\nlooking at Harry fully. \u201cTake a break, babe. You\u2019ve been in here since 7:30 and\nit\u2019s already 3. Come and have an hour nap with me or something.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t sweets. I\u2019ve got a Skype meeting with a caterer for\nthe Christmas party. I\u2019ll not be long, actually I could do with you being here\nwith me for it, it\u2019s your Christmas party after all.\u201d Harry wheeled so he was\nin front of [Y/N], his hands coming to rest on her knees. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you, it\u2019s not MY party, it\u2019s OURS now! You live\nhere with me. Also, a caterer? Two months before the party? It\u2019s not even been\nHalloween yet.\u201d [Y/N] shook her head while chuckling lightly. </p><p>\u201cBaby, you\u2019re funny. This is the first of what will turn\ninto 4 or 5 meetings sweets. We\u2019ve got today\u2019s which is going over the kind of\nfoods we want to have there, then the next one they\u2019ll go through a menu of\nthings and see what we like or don\u2019t like. The third we\u2019ll actually meet up and\ntaste the food.\u201d Harry\u2019s eyes lit up at the sound of a food tasting session.\n\u201cFinally, the week before the party we\u2019ll have one final tasting session just\nto make sure that everything is good. Then that meeting we\u2019ll also go through\nthe set up for the food and things. This will happen for the decorators too.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou are absolutely amazing at what you do, my love. How\nlong until the meeting with them?\u201d [Y/N] double checked her diary before\nletting Harry know that it wouldn\u2019t be for another ten minutes so if he needed\na wee to go now. \u201cI\u2019ll be back shortly.\u201d He planted a kiss on his girlfriend\u2019s\nlips before walking out of the room. </p><p>A few minutes later Harry walked back into the office,\nwearing a plain black top and carrying two mugs with him. </p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not having a nap then you\u2019re going to enjoy this\ncup of coffee that your insanely hot boyfriend has brought for you to drink\nwhile we talk to the caterers about our Christmas party menu. Can we get them\nto make glazed pigs in blankets on sticks?\u201d </p><p>[Y/N] took the mug from Harry\u2019s hands and took a sip of the\ncoffee, letting the hot liquid burn her throat as she did. Harry sat on his\nchair and wheeled it around the table, so they were sat next to one another and\nready to start the Skype meeting. </p><p>\u201cOh my insanely hot boyfriend knows the way to my heart!\nThank you!\u201d Once she\u2019d placed her drink on the desk, she turned to Harry and\nkissed his lips quickly. \u201cAnd yeah, we can have glazed pigs in blankets, my\nlove.\u201d</p><p>*** </p><p>When their alarm went off the following morning, [Y/N] was\nthe first to wake up. Once she\u2019d turned the alarm off, she turned over so she\nwas facing him. His face was pushed into the pillow, his lips pouting ever so\nslightly and his hair falling over his eyes. She brought her hand up to brush\nhis hair away and pressed her lips to his to try and wake him up. </p><p>\u201cBaby? We need to get up so we can go and see your mum.\u201d When\nHarry didn\u2019t budge from his sleep, [Y/N] moved her hand so the back of it was\nagainst the soft skin of his cheek. Her fingers brushed at his face softly,\nwatching as his breathing became a little ragged. \u201cI know you\u2019re awake, sleepy\nhead.\u201d His lips lifted into a small, almost unnoticeable smirk. </p><p>\u201c\u2019m not awake, dunno what you mean, angel.\u201d Harry sunk\nfurther into the pillow underneath his head, bringing his arms to wrap around \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0[Y/N]\u2019s waist to pull her into his hard\nchest. The pair lay for a few moments basking in one another\u2019s presence,\nwanting nothing more than for the moment to never end. </p><p>\u201cCome on, gorgeous. We have to get up and get going. You\npromised me a McDonald\u2019s breakfast before we left and it\u2019s already 9am!\u201d She\ntried to pull herself from Harry\u2019s grasp, only to be pulled even closer to him,\nher front hitting his with a thump and a groan. </p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t leaving his bed until I get at least one kissy\nfrom you. Then we can get up and get ready to go, promise.\u201d His eyes opened and\n[Y/N]\u2019s thumb came to wipe away the sleep that had formed in the corners of\nthem over night. Her hands rest on his jawline, and her thumbs rubbed at his\ncheekbones as she leaned in to press her lips against Harry\u2019s. She pulled away\nbut Harry brought his hands up to rest at her neck, pulling her in for more. \u201cI\nsaid at least one, I\u2019ve got another good one for you right,\u201d he pulled his\nforehead away from hers to look into her eyes, and then proceeded to move his\nlips back toward hers, \u201chere.\u201d When their lips touched again, they both moved\nimpossibly close to the other, their breaths becoming one. </p><p>When they finally parted, they were both gasping for breath\nand smiling widely. The both of them stretched their bodies before standing\nfrom the bed, tired eyes on the both of them. Harry walked into the closet\nwhile [Y/N] walked to turn the shower on so she could clean her body before\ntheir long car journey. Before stepping under the hot water, she brushed her\nteeth and got the shower products she wanted to use ready. </p><p>\u201cHey, mind if I join you?\u201d [Y/N] looked through the shower\ndoor to see Harry stood in just his boxers with a smile on his face. \u201cNo funny\nbusiness, I just can\u2019t be bothered waiting for you to finish.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI guess, but no funny business! And don\u2019t get my hair wet,\nI only washed it last night.\u201d Harry stepped into the shower and stepped under\nthe water, making his girlfriend move out of the stream of the water; causing\nher to groan loudly. \u201cIT\u2019S COLD NOT BEING UNDER THERE!\u201d </p><p>\u201cHere, turn around so your back is against me.\u201d While she\nturned around, Harry grabbed the shower gel and loofa before lathering it up.\n\u201cI\u2019ll wash you. Just stand here and keep warm.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThank you gorgeous.\u201d </p><p>*** </p><p>\u201cCHAAAIIIIIIIN, KEEP US TOGETHER!!\u201d The car was filled with\nthe sounds of Fleetwood Mac playing, and laughter from the two people. Harry\nturned the dial in the car to turn the music down, taking his eyes off the road\nfor a second to look at his girlfriend. </p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t be long until we\u2019re there, ladybug.\u201d [Y/N]\u2019s hand\nfumbled around to grab onto Harry\u2019s, bringing it up to kiss lovingly. Harry\nthen brought [Y/N]\u2019s hand up to kiss too, a smile plastered on both of their\nfaces as they did. Their hands retreated to rest on [Y/N]\u2019s leg, not untangling\nfrom one another as they did so. </p><p>\u201cGood, my bum is starting to go numb from sitting here for\nso long.\u201d A soft chuckle was shared between the two people before the car fell\nquiet once more, Fleetwood Mac still playing through the speakers at a reduced\nvolume. </p><p>The rest of the car ride was silent, comfortably so, but\nstill silent. Harry would steal glances at his girlfriend, and smirked when she\ncaught him staring. As they pulled up to Anne\u2019s house, [Y/N] saw the woman\nwho\u2019d given her the best boyfriend standing at the door, a large smile similar\nto Harry\u2019s adorning her face. </p><p>Anne walked toward the car once it stopped and rather than\nsaying hello to her son, she walked over to his girlfriend and embraced her\ntightly, telling her how much she\u2019d missed her and was happy to see her again.\nHarry stood to the side, a loving smile on his face as he watched two of his\nfavourite women hugging and smiling together. Once the hug broke, his mum\nopened her arms for him and he walked straight into them, leaning down to be at\nher level and holding her just as tightly as she was holding him. [Y/N] brought\nher hand up and placed it upon Harry\u2019s which sat on his mother\u2019s back, enjoying\nthe love that was radiating from the pair. </p><p>\u201cCome on you two, let\u2019s get you inside where it\u2019s warm. You\nstill drink coffee, right lovely?\u201d [Y/N] could see Harry chuckled besides her\nas she replied to the woman who raised her boyfriend. </p><p>\u201cOnly with my oxygen.\u201d Anne laughed at her response before\nwalking them into the kitchen of her home and placing a hot coffee in front of\neach of them. \u201cOh you are an actual superstar! Thank you.\u201d The first sip of\ncoffee hit [Y/N]\u2019s throat and she closed her eyes in bliss. Coffee had been the\nthing that got her through so many days but now she\u2019d grown to just love the\ntaste, and feeling it gave her when she drank it, no longer needing it for the\nenergy. </p><p>The three people walked through the house and into Anne\u2019s\nliving room, where the TV played a Strictly Come Dancing rerun quietly. As Harry\nand [Y/N] sat on the smaller of the sofas that sat in the room, Harry pulled\nhis girlfriend into him and draped her legs over his own, using his hands to\nrub at her calves while she rest her head on his shoulder. </p><p>\u201cHow\u2019ve you been, Anne? It seems like it\u2019s been ages since I\nlast saw you.\u201d Anne placed her mug of tea on the coffee table before smiling at\nthe two people in front of her. Though she would never admit it, she was\nsceptical when Harry had told her that he\u2019d met a girl in Starbucks and that she\u2019d\nbeen a fan; sceptical that the girl was only wanting to date him because he was\nHarry Styles; and sceptical that Harry\u2019s heart would be broken. But seeing the\ntwo of them in front of her, Harry\u2019s eyes flicking to his girlfriend every now\nand then to make sure she was still there, and his lips not being able to stay\nin a straight line whenever he did, she knew that they were good together, and\nthat they were happy. Harry was happy, and she was happy that he was happy.\nShe\u2019d grown to love [Y/N] like a daughter and knew that it wasn\u2019t about the\nfame, but that she really, truly loved Harry and Anne couldn\u2019t be more\ngrateful. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been good thank you sweets. Really good.\u201d She smiled\nat [Y/N], who had placed her hand on Harry\u2019s which were resting on her legs at\nthat point. \u201cWhat are your plans for the next few weeks?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI have graduation in three weeks and then Harry flies out\nto LA for Halloween the day after. I\u2019ll be having meetings regarding the\nChristmas party and then I have to meet up with my boss to decide what\u2019s\nhappening next year and where we want to take things. Feel free to come down\nfor a bit while Harry\u2019s swanning it in the sun, if you\u2019d like!\u201d Harry smiled at\nhis mum, too wrapped up in his thoughts that he hadn\u2019t heard her speak to him. </p><p>\u201cSorry, what was that?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou really are ridiculous sometimes. I asked why you\u2019re in\nLA.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the Casamigo\u2019s Halloween party, and then I have to\nhave a few meetings with Jeff to discuss the new album. I\u2019ll only be gone for a\nweek or two. Then it\u2019ll be back home to my gorgeous girlfriend and planning\nChristmas.\u201d [Y/N]\u2019s cheeks heated as Harry called her gorgeous, and she lightly\nkissed his shoulder as he grabbed her hand. \u201cBut, [Y/N], don\u2019t forget that when\nI\u2019m in LA Liv is coming for a couple of days.\u201d [Y/N]\u2019s eyes widened at the\nrealisation before turning to Anne. </p><p>\u201cI forgot she was coming! You\u2019re still more than welcome.\nGems could come too, and we\u2019ll have a proper girly day!\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat would be lovely, dear.\u201d </p><p>***</p><p>After lunch, Harry and [Y/N] had gone upstairs to unpack\ntheir bags while Anne popped to the shops to get a few bits for their evening\nmeal. When she returned to the house, the couple weren\u2019t downstairs and so she\nwalked up to Harry\u2019s bedroom to see if they were there. The door was ajar\nslightly and as she peered around it, she saw her son and his girlfriend\nunderneath the covers, with their foreheads touching, fast asleep. Even though\nthey were covered by a thin sheet, she could see the outline of Harry\u2019s hand\nresting upon [Y/N]\u2019s hip. She smiled at the view before taking a quick photo-purely\nto show the two later on in the day-and leaving the room, closing the door\nbehind her as to not wake them up when she started to cook. </p><p>An hour later, [Y/N] walked through to the kitchen with\ntired eyes and a smile plastered on her face. Anne had Queen playing through\nher speaker while she made the lasagne for their dinner. When she heard someone\nat the door, she turned around with a smile and ushered the younger girl into\nthe kitchen and to sit on one of the stools at the island. </p><p>\u201cDid you have a nice nap?\u201d [Y/N] nodded, while yawning and\nrubbing at her eyes. </p><p>\u201cI did thank you. I blame your son for this by the way, he\u2019s\ngot me into the habit of having a nap every now and then, but I hate it. It\nmakes me feel so unproductive.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a nuisance like that. He\u2019s always been the same too,\nhaving a quick hour nap through the day. But then he wonders why he can\u2019t sleep\non a night.\u201d [Y/N]\u2019s head nodded quickly, as if to prove that she really did\nagree. </p><p>\u201cThat happens every time he takes a nap! But if I haven\u2019t\nhad one and could fall asleep easily, he\u2019ll talk to me until I\u2019m no longer\nsleep then we\u2019re both awake for hours longer than necessary. It\u2019s a good job I\nlove him.\u201d Anne smiled at that, knowing that Harry really was loved, and it\nwasn\u2019t just a show. The way it so easily fell from [Y/N]\u2019s mouth made her\nrealise even more that what the two shared was real. </p><p>\u201cYou really do love him, don\u2019t you? This isn\u2019t a short-term\nthing.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI hope it isn\u2019t a short-term thing, in my eyes I know that Harry\nis it for me. I assure you that I will do everything in my power to make Harry\nthe happiest I can. He came into my life when it was hectic, and even though he\u2019s\na busy man himself, he was willing to spend as much time as he could with me\nwhen I wasn\u2019t trying to write essays and get everything sent off, so I can\ngraduate.\u201d [Y/N] smiled at the top of the island remembering everything she\u2019s\ngone through with Harry. \u201cWhen he goes away, even if it\u2019s just for a couple of\nhours to go to an interview, or if he has a meeting, my heart physically aches\nuntil he comes home and hugs me. Sometimes I feel weird and that he thinks I\u2019m\ntoo clingy.\u201d Anne stayed silent, so she could hear the rest of what [Y/N] was\nsaying, the smile on her face never dimming. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him perform a couple of\ntimes but when I saw him do the gig in LA for a few people, I came to realise\njust how utterly proud I am of him. He gives his all to everything he does and\nseeing him performing just makes me heart swell even more. It\u2019s the little things\nthat make me realise how much I love him, the way he will hold eye contact\nwhile I\u2019m talking, even if I\u2019m looking a different way, the way he just grabs my\nhand when we\u2019re sat down, and draws patterns on it; the way that when he wakes\nup in the middle of the night he\u2019ll grab onto my waist and pull me even closer\nto him, with his nose pressed to the back of my neck as he drifts back off into\nsleep; and mainly, the love he has, and shows for you. He loves me, but he\nhonestly adores you! He tells me all the time that he loves you and I realise\nthat you are number one in his life, but that is completely fine with me. You\u2019ve\nbrought the most loving, respectful, trustworthy man into the world and I love\nyou for that.\u201d </p><p>\u201c[Y/N], you have no idea how lovely that was to hear. Can I\ntell you something?\u201d </p><p> \u201cOf course.\u201d It was\nalmost a whisper, her voice wavering as the nerves hit her. </p><p>\u201cThe day that Harry called me and told me that he\u2019d met a\ngirl in Starbucks and that she\u2019d been a fan of his for a while, I got so scared\nthat the girl was in it for the money, and the fame of being linked with \u2018Harry\nStyles\u2019,\u201d Anne made air quotes around her son\u2019s name, while [Y/N] came to\nrealise that the girl Anne was talking about, was her. \u201cI\u2019ve known for a while\nthat it wasn\u2019t the case, but hearing you tell me all of those things, and\nseeing you and Harry together, I realise how stupid I was to ever think that. I\nlove you and I love that you love Harry.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI have never thought of Harry as anything but \u2018Harry\u2019. My\nmind has never gone \u2018Oh my days I\u2019m dating Harry Styles\u2019, it\u2019s \u2018oh my days, I\u2019m\ndating Harry, and I love him\u2019. Harry is the most down to earth, loving man that\nhas ever walked the earth. He\u2019s the man who loves his family more than anything\nand would do literally anything for them. Your son is the best thing that has\never happened to me, and the world; so yeah, I was a fan before I met him, but\nnow I\u2019m his fan in a completely different way.\u201d</p><p>[Y/N] stood up from her place and let Anne\u2019s arms wrap\naround her. They stood in a hug for five minutes before Harry walked into the\nkitchen and looked at the two women curiously. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d Anne let go of [Y/N] and walked back\nto the oven while [Y/N] walked to Harry, wrapping her arms around him and\nnesting her face in his neck. </p><p>\u201cNothing, feel better after your nap?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI do for now, until later when I can\u2019t sleep.\u201d Everyone in\nthe room laughed and as it died down, Anne could be heard to hum happily. She\nturned around to see Harry pressing his lips to [Y/N]\u2019s, pulling away quickly\nand smiling at her with his eyes being slightly narrowed due to his cheeks\nrising with the smile. </p><p>*** </p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s [Y/N]?\u201d Harry sat on the sofa next to his mum,\nbringing his phone out of his pocket so he could sit comfortably. </p><p>\u201cOh, she\u2019s just having a quick shower, she\u2019ll be down in twenty\nminutes or so. Can we have a chat please?\u201d Anne placed her mug on the coffee\ntable and turned her body, so she was facing her son, her hands on her knees\nand her head tilted slightly. </p><p>\u201cOf course! What\u2019s bothering you?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHow do you know that you\u2019re in love? Like, when it\u2019s the\nreal deal and you want it to last forever?\u201d Harry looked straight into his mum\u2019s\neyes, hoping to get her true reaction. What he couldn\u2019t see were the thoughts\nthat went through her mind. Her conversation with [Y/N] replaying in her head. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s making you ask this?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got something to do but I just want to be sure that\nwhat I\u2019m feeling is what I think it is.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou know you\u2019re in love when the first person that comes to\nmind when you do anything, is them. When you can close your eyes and picture\nthem sat smiling at you; when they\u2019re happiness means everything to you and you\nwould do anything you could to make them happy; when if you aren\u2019t with them\nyou want to be with them, even if they\u2019re only in the room next to you; and\nwhen any time their name is spoken, you immediately smile and your heart starts\nbeating faster because you\u2019re excited. Being in love is something that you do\nhave to work on though, and it isn\u2019t always sunshine. You have blips when you\u2019re\nin love, but it\u2019s the love you share that means you can\u2019t walk away.\u201d Anne looked\nat Harry, who had a serious look on his face, playing with the rings on his\nfingers and his knee bouncing fast. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d </p><p>Harry didn\u2019t respond, the silence in the room almost deafening\nto Anne, who worried that Harry was going to tell her that he was no longer in\nlove with the girl who was upstairs, and that he was going to end things with\nher. She knew it wasn\u2019t fair to think that but when Harry had been silent for a\nfew seconds, scrolling through his phone, she feared the worst. Until Harry\nturned his phone around and showed her the screen he was on. </p><p>\u201cI love her mum. She is the love of my life and I\u2019ve known\nfor a while now. I know we\u2019ve only been in a relationship for seven months, but\nwe were dating for three months before that. I love her more than I love myself\nand I want her to be by my side for the rest of my life, every day I want to\nsee her, and only her. I want to wake up next to her on a morning, I want to\nhave children with her, I want to travel with her and I want to grow old with\nher. She\u2019s my everything.\u201d </p><p>The light blue box sat in his underwear drawer, underneath\nall of them where he knew no one would see it. The photo he was showing Anne had\nthe box open, a soleste cut, white gold ring, with the words \u2018all my love, H\u2019\nengraved on the underside of it. He couldn\u2019t help the smile on his face as he\nwatched his mum\u2019s eyes widen, then glisten as tears threatened to spill. </p><p>\u201cI want to ask her to marry me.\u201d </p>",

The only\nsounds that could be heard were the sounds of the keys being pressed on [Y/N]&rsquo;s\nlaptop and the padding of Harry&rsquo;s feet on the wooden floor of the office. [Y/N]\nlooked up from her computer screen and smiled at her boyfriend, removing her\nglasses momentarily to rub at her eyes. Harry sat on his computer chair and\nwheeled over to his love&rsquo;s desks and rest his legs on the edge of it. </p><p>&ldquo;My mum wants to know if we want to go and spend the weekend\nat her house.&rdquo; [Y/N] quickly signed off the email that she&rsquo;d been writing,\nbefore making sure that her meeting with a decorator was booked fully for the\nweek after.</p><p>&ldquo;That would be nice, I&rsquo;ve missed her. Do you want to go\ntomorrow then? Stay until Sunday?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah if that&rsquo;s all good?&rdquo; [Y/N] nodded before smiling at\nher boyfriend, her eyes closing for a few seconds before opening again and\nlooking at Harry fully. &ldquo;Take a break, babe. You&rsquo;ve been in here since 7:30 and\nit&rsquo;s already 3. Come and have an hour nap with me or something.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t sweets. I&rsquo;ve got a Skype meeting with a caterer for\nthe Christmas party. I&rsquo;ll not be long, actually I could do with you being here\nwith me for it, it&rsquo;s your Christmas party after all.&rdquo; Harry wheeled so he was\nin front of [Y/N], his hands coming to rest on her knees. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you, it&rsquo;s not MY party, it&rsquo;s OURS now! You live\nhere with me. Also, a caterer? Two months before the party? It&rsquo;s not even been\nHalloween yet.&rdquo; [Y/N] shook her head while chuckling lightly. </p><p>&ldquo;Baby, you&rsquo;re funny. This is the first of what will turn\ninto 4 or 5 meetings sweets. We&rsquo;ve got today&rsquo;s which is going over the kind of\nfoods we want to have there, then the next one they&rsquo;ll go through a menu of\nthings and see what we like or don&rsquo;t like. The third we&rsquo;ll actually meet up and\ntaste the food.&rdquo; Harry&rsquo;s eyes lit up at the sound of a food tasting session.\n&ldquo;Finally, the week before the party we&rsquo;ll have one final tasting session just\nto make sure that everything is good. Then that meeting we&rsquo;ll also go through\nthe set up for the food and things. This will happen for the decorators too.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You are absolutely amazing at what you do, my love. How\nlong until the meeting with them?&rdquo; [Y/N] double checked her diary before\nletting Harry know that it wouldn&rsquo;t be for another ten minutes so if he needed\na wee to go now. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back shortly.&rdquo; He planted a kiss on his girlfriend&rsquo;s\nlips before walking out of the room. </p><p>A few minutes later Harry walked back into the office,\nwearing a plain black top and carrying two mugs with him. </p><p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not having a nap then you&rsquo;re going to enjoy this\ncup of coffee that your insanely hot boyfriend has brought for you to drink\nwhile we talk to the caterers about our Christmas party menu. Can we get them\nto make glazed pigs in blankets on sticks?&rdquo; </p><p>[Y/N] took the mug from Harry&rsquo;s hands and took a sip of the\ncoffee, letting the hot liquid burn her throat as she did. Harry sat on his\nchair and wheeled it around the table, so they were sat next to one another and\nready to start the Skype meeting. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh my insanely hot boyfriend knows the way to my heart!\nThank you!&rdquo; Once she&rsquo;d placed her drink on the desk, she turned to Harry and\nkissed his lips quickly. &ldquo;And yeah, we can have glazed pigs in blankets, my\nlove.&rdquo;</p><p>*** </p><p>When their alarm went off the following morning, [Y/N] was\nthe first to wake up. Once she&rsquo;d turned the alarm off, she turned over so she\nwas facing him. His face was pushed into the pillow, his lips pouting ever so\nslightly and his hair falling over his eyes. She brought her hand up to brush\nhis hair away and pressed her lips to his to try and wake him up. </p><p>&ldquo;Baby? We need to get up so we can go and see your mum.&rdquo; When\nHarry didn&rsquo;t budge from his sleep, [Y/N] moved her hand so the back of it was\nagainst the soft skin of his cheek. Her fingers brushed at his face softly,\nwatching as his breathing became a little ragged. &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re awake, sleepy\nhead.&rdquo; His lips lifted into a small, almost unnoticeable smirk. </p><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;m not awake, dunno what you mean, angel.&rdquo; Harry sunk\nfurther into the pillow underneath his head, bringing his arms to wrap around &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;[Y/N]&rsquo;s waist to pull her into his hard\nchest. The pair lay for a few moments basking in one another&rsquo;s presence,\nwanting nothing more than for the moment to never end. </p><p>&ldquo;Come on, gorgeous. We have to get up and get going. You\npromised me a McDonald&rsquo;s breakfast before we left and it&rsquo;s already 9am!&rdquo; She\ntried to pull herself from Harry&rsquo;s grasp, only to be pulled even closer to him,\nher front hitting his with a thump and a groan. </p><p>&ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t leaving his bed until I get at least one kissy\nfrom you. Then we can get up and get ready to go, promise.&rdquo; His eyes opened and\n[Y/N]&rsquo;s thumb came to wipe away the sleep that had formed in the corners of\nthem over night. Her hands rest on his jawline, and her thumbs rubbed at his\ncheekbones as she leaned in to press her lips against Harry&rsquo;s. She pulled away\nbut Harry brought his hands up to rest at her neck, pulling her in for more. &ldquo;I\nsaid at least one, I&rsquo;ve got another good one for you right,&rdquo; he pulled his\nforehead away from hers to look into her eyes, and then proceeded to move his\nlips back toward hers, &ldquo;here.&rdquo; When their lips touched again, they both moved\nimpossibly close to the other, their breaths becoming one. </p><p>When they finally parted, they were both gasping for breath\nand smiling widely. The both of them stretched their bodies before standing\nfrom the bed, tired eyes on the both of them. Harry walked into the closet\nwhile [Y/N] walked to turn the shower on so she could clean her body before\ntheir long car journey. Before stepping under the hot water, she brushed her\nteeth and got the shower products she wanted to use ready. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, mind if I join you?&rdquo; [Y/N] looked through the shower\ndoor to see Harry stood in just his boxers with a smile on his face. &ldquo;No funny\nbusiness, I just can&rsquo;t be bothered waiting for you to finish.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I guess, but no funny business! And don&rsquo;t get my hair wet,\nI only washed it last night.&rdquo; Harry stepped into the shower and stepped under\nthe water, making his girlfriend move out of the stream of the water; causing\nher to groan loudly. &ldquo;IT&rsquo;S COLD NOT BEING UNDER THERE!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Here, turn around so your back is against me.&rdquo; While she\nturned around, Harry grabbed the shower gel and loofa before lathering it up.\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wash you. Just stand here and keep warm.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you gorgeous.&rdquo; </p><p>*** </p><p>&ldquo;CHAAAIIIIIIIN, KEEP US TOGETHER!!&rdquo; The car was filled with\nthe sounds of Fleetwood Mac playing, and laughter from the two people. Harry\nturned the dial in the car to turn the music down, taking his eyes off the road\nfor a second to look at his girlfriend. </p><p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t be long until we&rsquo;re there, ladybug.&rdquo; [Y/N]&rsquo;s hand\nfumbled around to grab onto Harry&rsquo;s, bringing it up to kiss lovingly. Harry\nthen brought [Y/N]&rsquo;s hand up to kiss too, a smile plastered on both of their\nfaces as they did. Their hands retreated to rest on [Y/N]&rsquo;s leg, not untangling\nfrom one another as they did so. </p><p>&ldquo;Good, my bum is starting to go numb from sitting here for\nso long.&rdquo; A soft chuckle was shared between the two people before the car fell\nquiet once more, Fleetwood Mac still playing through the speakers at a reduced\nvolume. </p><p>The rest of the car ride was silent, comfortably so, but\nstill silent. Harry would steal glances at his girlfriend, and smirked when she\ncaught him staring. As they pulled up to Anne&rsquo;s house, [Y/N] saw the woman\nwho&rsquo;d given her the best boyfriend standing at the door, a large smile similar\nto Harry&rsquo;s adorning her face. </p><p>Anne walked toward the car once it stopped and rather than\nsaying hello to her son, she walked over to his girlfriend and embraced her\ntightly, telling her how much she&rsquo;d missed her and was happy to see her again.\nHarry stood to the side, a loving smile on his face as he watched two of his\nfavourite women hugging and smiling together. Once the hug broke, his mum\nopened her arms for him and he walked straight into them, leaning down to be at\nher level and holding her just as tightly as she was holding him. [Y/N] brought\nher hand up and placed it upon Harry&rsquo;s which sat on his mother&rsquo;s back, enjoying\nthe love that was radiating from the pair. </p><p>&ldquo;Come on you two, let&rsquo;s get you inside where it&rsquo;s warm. You\nstill drink coffee, right lovely?&rdquo; [Y/N] could see Harry chuckled besides her\nas she replied to the woman who raised her boyfriend. </p><p>&ldquo;Only with my oxygen.&rdquo; Anne laughed at her response before\nwalking them into the kitchen of her home and placing a hot coffee in front of\neach of them. &ldquo;Oh you are an actual superstar! Thank you.&rdquo; The first sip of\ncoffee hit [Y/N]&rsquo;s throat and she closed her eyes in bliss. Coffee had been the\nthing that got her through so many days but now she&rsquo;d grown to just love the\ntaste, and feeling it gave her when she drank it, no longer needing it for the\nenergy. </p><p>The three people walked through the house and into Anne&rsquo;s\nliving room, where the TV played a Strictly Come Dancing rerun quietly. As Harry\nand [Y/N] sat on the smaller of the sofas that sat in the room, Harry pulled\nhis girlfriend into him and draped her legs over his own, using his hands to\nrub at her calves while she rest her head on his shoulder. </p><p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;ve you been, Anne? It seems like it&rsquo;s been ages since I\nlast saw you.&rdquo; Anne placed her mug of tea on the coffee table before smiling at\nthe two people in front of her. Though she would never admit it, she was\nsceptical when Harry had told her that he&rsquo;d met a girl in Starbucks and that she&rsquo;d\nbeen a fan; sceptical that the girl was only wanting to date him because he was\nHarry Styles; and sceptical that Harry&rsquo;s heart would be broken. But seeing the\ntwo of them in front of her, Harry&rsquo;s eyes flicking to his girlfriend every now\nand then to make sure she was still there, and his lips not being able to stay\nin a straight line whenever he did, she knew that they were good together, and\nthat they were happy. Harry was happy, and she was happy that he was happy.\nShe&rsquo;d grown to love [Y/N] like a daughter and knew that it wasn&rsquo;t about the\nfame, but that she really, truly loved Harry and Anne couldn&rsquo;t be more\ngrateful. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been good thank you sweets. Really good.&rdquo; She smiled\nat [Y/N], who had placed her hand on Harry&rsquo;s which were resting on her legs at\nthat point. &ldquo;What are your plans for the next few weeks?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I have graduation in three weeks and then Harry flies out\nto LA for Halloween the day after. I&rsquo;ll be having meetings regarding the\nChristmas party and then I have to meet up with my boss to decide what&rsquo;s\nhappening next year and where we want to take things. Feel free to come down\nfor a bit while Harry&rsquo;s swanning it in the sun, if you&rsquo;d like!&rdquo; Harry smiled at\nhis mum, too wrapped up in his thoughts that he hadn&rsquo;t heard her speak to him. </p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, what was that?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You really are ridiculous sometimes. I asked why you&rsquo;re in\nLA.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Casamigo&rsquo;s Halloween party, and then I have to\nhave a few meetings with Jeff to discuss the new album. I&rsquo;ll only be gone for a\nweek or two. Then it&rsquo;ll be back home to my gorgeous girlfriend and planning\nChristmas.&rdquo; [Y/N]&rsquo;s cheeks heated as Harry called her gorgeous, and she lightly\nkissed his shoulder as he grabbed her hand. &ldquo;But, [Y/N], don&rsquo;t forget that when\nI&rsquo;m in LA Liv is coming for a couple of days.&rdquo; [Y/N]&rsquo;s eyes widened at the\nrealisation before turning to Anne. </p><p>&ldquo;I forgot she was coming! You&rsquo;re still more than welcome.\nGems could come too, and we&rsquo;ll have a proper girly day!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;That would be lovely, dear.&rdquo; </p><p>***</p><p>After lunch, Harry and [Y/N] had gone upstairs to unpack\ntheir bags while Anne popped to the shops to get a few bits for their evening\nmeal. When she returned to the house, the couple weren&rsquo;t downstairs and so she\nwalked up to Harry&rsquo;s bedroom to see if they were there. The door was ajar\nslightly and as she peered around it, she saw her son and his girlfriend\nunderneath the covers, with their foreheads touching, fast asleep. Even though\nthey were covered by a thin sheet, she could see the outline of Harry&rsquo;s hand\nresting upon [Y/N]&rsquo;s hip. She smiled at the view before taking a quick photo-purely\nto show the two later on in the day-and leaving the room, closing the door\nbehind her as to not wake them up when she started to cook. </p><p>An hour later, [Y/N] walked through to the kitchen with\ntired eyes and a smile plastered on her face. Anne had Queen playing through\nher speaker while she made the lasagne for their dinner. When she heard someone\nat the door, she turned around with a smile and ushered the younger girl into\nthe kitchen and to sit on one of the stools at the island. </p><p>&ldquo;Did you have a nice nap?&rdquo; [Y/N] nodded, while yawning and\nrubbing at her eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;I did thank you. I blame your son for this by the way, he&rsquo;s\ngot me into the habit of having a nap every now and then, but I hate it. It\nmakes me feel so unproductive.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a nuisance like that. He&rsquo;s always been the same too,\nhaving a quick hour nap through the day. But then he wonders why he can&rsquo;t sleep\non a night.&rdquo; [Y/N]&rsquo;s head nodded quickly, as if to prove that she really did\nagree. </p><p>&ldquo;That happens every time he takes a nap! But if I haven&rsquo;t\nhad one and could fall asleep easily, he&rsquo;ll talk to me until I&rsquo;m no longer\nsleep then we&rsquo;re both awake for hours longer than necessary. It&rsquo;s a good job I\nlove him.&rdquo; Anne smiled at that, knowing that Harry really was loved, and it\nwasn&rsquo;t just a show. The way it so easily fell from [Y/N]&rsquo;s mouth made her\nrealise even more that what the two shared was real. </p><p>&ldquo;You really do love him, don&rsquo;t you? This isn&rsquo;t a short-term\nthing.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I hope it isn&rsquo;t a short-term thing, in my eyes I know that Harry\nis it for me. I assure you that I will do everything in my power to make Harry\nthe happiest I can. He came into my life when it was hectic, and even though he&rsquo;s\na busy man himself, he was willing to spend as much time as he could with me\nwhen I wasn&rsquo;t trying to write essays and get everything sent off, so I can\ngraduate.&rdquo; [Y/N] smiled at the top of the island remembering everything she&rsquo;s\ngone through with Harry. &ldquo;When he goes away, even if it&rsquo;s just for a couple of\nhours to go to an interview, or if he has a meeting, my heart physically aches\nuntil he comes home and hugs me. Sometimes I feel weird and that he thinks I&rsquo;m\ntoo clingy.&rdquo; Anne stayed silent, so she could hear the rest of what [Y/N] was\nsaying, the smile on her face never dimming. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen him perform a couple of\ntimes but when I saw him do the gig in LA for a few people, I came to realise\njust how utterly proud I am of him. He gives his all to everything he does and\nseeing him performing just makes me heart swell even more. It&rsquo;s the little things\nthat make me realise how much I love him, the way he will hold eye contact\nwhile I&rsquo;m talking, even if I&rsquo;m looking a different way, the way he just grabs my\nhand when we&rsquo;re sat down, and draws patterns on it; the way that when he wakes\nup in the middle of the night he&rsquo;ll grab onto my waist and pull me even closer\nto him, with his nose pressed to the back of my neck as he drifts back off into\nsleep; and mainly, the love he has, and shows for you. He loves me, but he\nhonestly adores you! He tells me all the time that he loves you and I realise\nthat you are number one in his life, but that is completely fine with me. You&rsquo;ve\nbrought the most loving, respectful, trustworthy man into the world and I love\nyou for that.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;[Y/N], you have no idea how lovely that was to hear. Can I\ntell you something?&rdquo; </p><p> &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; It was\nalmost a whisper, her voice wavering as the nerves hit her. </p><p>&ldquo;The day that Harry called me and told me that he&rsquo;d met a\ngirl in Starbucks and that she&rsquo;d been a fan of his for a while, I got so scared\nthat the girl was in it for the money, and the fame of being linked with &lsquo;Harry\nStyles&rsquo;,&rdquo; Anne made air quotes around her son&rsquo;s name, while [Y/N] came to\nrealise that the girl Anne was talking about, was her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known for a while\nthat it wasn&rsquo;t the case, but hearing you tell me all of those things, and\nseeing you and Harry together, I realise how stupid I was to ever think that. I\nlove you and I love that you love Harry.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I have never thought of Harry as anything but &lsquo;Harry&rsquo;. My\nmind has never gone &lsquo;Oh my days I&rsquo;m dating Harry Styles&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s &lsquo;oh my days, I&rsquo;m\ndating Harry, and I love him&rsquo;. Harry is the most down to earth, loving man that\nhas ever walked the earth. He&rsquo;s the man who loves his family more than anything\nand would do literally anything for them. Your son is the best thing that has\never happened to me, and the world; so yeah, I was a fan before I met him, but\nnow I&rsquo;m his fan in a completely different way.&rdquo;</p><p>[Y/N] stood up from her place and let Anne&rsquo;s arms wrap\naround her. They stood in a hug for five minutes before Harry walked into the\nkitchen and looked at the two women curiously. </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on here?&rdquo; Anne let go of [Y/N] and walked back\nto the oven while [Y/N] walked to Harry, wrapping her arms around him and\nnesting her face in his neck. </p><p>&ldquo;Nothing, feel better after your nap?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I do for now, until later when I can&rsquo;t sleep.&rdquo; Everyone in\nthe room laughed and as it died down, Anne could be heard to hum happily. She\nturned around to see Harry pressing his lips to [Y/N]&rsquo;s, pulling away quickly\nand smiling at her with his eyes being slightly narrowed due to his cheeks\nrising with the smile. </p><p>*** </p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s [Y/N]?&rdquo; Harry sat on the sofa next to his mum,\nbringing his phone out of his pocket so he could sit comfortably. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s just having a quick shower, she&rsquo;ll be down in twenty\nminutes or so. Can we have a chat please?&rdquo; Anne placed her mug on the coffee\ntable and turned her body, so she was facing her son, her hands on her knees\nand her head tilted slightly. </p><p>&ldquo;Of course! What&rsquo;s bothering you?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;How do you know that you&rsquo;re in love? Like, when it&rsquo;s the\nreal deal and you want it to last forever?&rdquo; Harry looked straight into his mum&rsquo;s\neyes, hoping to get her true reaction. What he couldn&rsquo;t see were the thoughts\nthat went through her mind. Her conversation with [Y/N] replaying in her head. </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s making you ask this?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got something to do but I just want to be sure that\nwhat I&rsquo;m feeling is what I think it is.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You know you&rsquo;re in love when the first person that comes to\nmind when you do anything, is them. When you can close your eyes and picture\nthem sat smiling at you; when they&rsquo;re happiness means everything to you and you\nwould do anything you could to make them happy; when if you aren&rsquo;t with them\nyou want to be with them, even if they&rsquo;re only in the room next to you; and\nwhen any time their name is spoken, you immediately smile and your heart starts\nbeating faster because you&rsquo;re excited. Being in love is something that you do\nhave to work on though, and it isn&rsquo;t always sunshine. You have blips when you&rsquo;re\nin love, but it&rsquo;s the love you share that means you can&rsquo;t walk away.&rdquo; Anne looked\nat Harry, who had a serious look on his face, playing with the rings on his\nfingers and his knee bouncing fast. &ldquo;Is everything okay?&rdquo; </p><p>Harry didn&rsquo;t respond, the silence in the room almost deafening\nto Anne, who worried that Harry was going to tell her that he was no longer in\nlove with the girl who was upstairs, and that he was going to end things with\nher. She knew it wasn&rsquo;t fair to think that but when Harry had been silent for a\nfew seconds, scrolling through his phone, she feared the worst. Until Harry\nturned his phone around and showed her the screen he was on. </p><p>&ldquo;I love her mum. She is the love of my life and I&rsquo;ve known\nfor a while now. I know we&rsquo;ve only been in a relationship for seven months, but\nwe were dating for three months before that. I love her more than I love myself\nand I want her to be by my side for the rest of my life, every day I want to\nsee her, and only her. I want to wake up next to her on a morning, I want to\nhave children with her, I want to travel with her and I want to grow old with\nher. She&rsquo;s my everything.&rdquo; </p><p>The light blue box sat in his underwear drawer, underneath\nall of them where he knew no one would see it. The photo he was showing Anne had\nthe box open, a soleste cut, white gold ring, with the words &lsquo;all my love, H&rsquo;\nengraved on the underside of it. He couldn&rsquo;t help the smile on his face as he\nwatched his mum&rsquo;s eyes widen, then glisten as tears threatened to spill. </p><p>&ldquo;I want to ask her to marry me.&rdquo; </p>",

See, his singles as a singer weren\u2019t really doing him justice. So, he and Gigi split and when that happened, all eyes were on both stars. With our attention finally on them, it was the perfect moment for Zayn to release \u201cLet Me\u201d. Once he released that and received the appropriate amount of responses that pleased his eyes, he and Gigi got back together.</p><p>Thinking back on it now, I agreed with that fan.
