Harry, I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m\u2026 I should be happy, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I thought it\u2019s gonna upset you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but why? Part of me is proud of you. Singing that song in Madison Square Garden. That was your dream, Harry. I am proud of you. But I feel an ache in my heart. Because you know that I wanted to sing that with you. And it happened before that I sang with you on stage this tour. So, you can\u2019t say that you\u2019re singing with her just because you don\u2019t want to fuel rumors around us. And you were a lot with her recently. And my silly heart says that you might be more interested in her than in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No. We were a lot together just to make this performance happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But feelings are like a flower they grow if you water them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, if you want \u00a0to be alone\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019d like to\u201d you sighed.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to have dinner with me and the band?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Call me when you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks\u201d he was already by the door.</p><p>\u201cAnd y/n.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d he left before you could say anything.</p><p>You didn\u2019t need things to be more messed up right now. In two days Harry will do two shows at Madison Square Garden, you have a lot of work to do, this is a huge thing. You didn\u2019t need this. You tried to cool down a bit before dinner. You took a hot bath with a relaxing bath bomb. It was a turtle-shaped bath bomb you bought in Lush. One for Harry and one for you. You listened to some relaxing music and let fresh air into the room. These things made you a little more relaxed. Harry rang you and you went down to the restaurant to have dinner. Clare, Adam, Sarah, and Mitch were already there and you arrived with Harry. It was all fun, but you knew Sarah noticed something\u2019s off.</p><p>Sarah: wanna talk about it after dinner?</p><p>You: we can. My room</p><p>You texted back under the table. When you all finished you went back to your room and Sarah followed you.</p><p>\u201cHey! I noticed something\u2019s wrong. What\u2019s up?\u201d she asked while she hopped on your bed.</p><p>\u201cYou knew that Harry\u2019s gonna perform with Kacey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I uhm.. I\u2019m the drummer\u2026\u201d she said looking down like it was her fault too.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why but I feel so bad. I feel\u2026 that\u2026. I don\u2019t know, I might be jealous. I thought Harry would sing that song with me and not her\u201d you burst out.</p><p>\u201cBut wouldn\u2019t that make you more suspicious?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve sung together on stage on this tour before. I don\u2019t see why it would be a problem. And she\u2019s around Kacey a lot lately\u201d she hugged you. You felt tears on your cheeks. \u201cIf I were around some guy, he\u2019d be following my every step and making sure that I don\u2019t spend extra time with anyone over the necessary. But if it\u2019s him it\u2019s nothing\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand you, dear. Tell him what you feel and maybe you can talk it through or solve it somehow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I have to, but I\u2019ll leave it for when we finished in New York. These days are too busy. What could happen in two days?\u201d</p><p>Next day you had some work with the managers and you all met in the hotel\u2019s conference room while you knew Harry was out with Mitch in some music stores. The meeting was finished at 1 pm and you decided to have lunch with Jeff and the tour manager. Harry texted you that your date is tonight and you should wear something hot so you\u2019re going shopping as soon as you\u2019re ready. You totally forgot about the date, but you were happy you\u2019re going shopping because you had no idea what to wear. Harry guided you to denim and t-shirts which made you think that it\u2019s not gonna be a fancy restaurant date. In the end, you bought an oversize black Gucci tee, black skinny pants with the New York Yankees patch and a pink sequins bomber jacket. Back in the hotel, you matched it with your Gucci loafers and some cool earrings and rings. Harry was really satisfied with that and he chose casual Gucci to wear too. You left the hotel at about six and went by a tour car.</p><p>\u201cUhm\u2026 we have to stop at MSG first\u201d Harry said.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there a concert tonight? Why do you have to go there?\u201d you asked but he stayed silent and you didn\u2019t want to ask again. Harry parked the car in the parking garage. When you got out of the car Harry stopped you.</p><p>\u201cHey! This is my gift for you. I love you and I planned this for so long\u201d he smiled.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d you asked looking around.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go through that door and you\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He locked the car and took you by the hand. When he opened the door you didn\u2019t understand first. It was a back entrance and you saw people going around crazy. You saw a security guard that was going to stop you.</p><p>\u201cSir, lady, can I see your admission cards?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOh shoot! Yes of course!\u201d Harry said and took two neck straps with the cards on the ends.</p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d the man said. Harry hid the cards.</p><p>\u201cHarry, would you tell me what\u2019s going on?\u201d you asked impatiently.</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d you heard someone yell from behind. You slowly turned around to see the body of the familiar voice.</p><p>\u201cHoly\u2026!\u201d you cried out. Jared Leto was pacing through the crowd of people in your direction. You looked at Harry. He smirked.</p><p>\u201cY/N, I couldn\u2019t wait to finally meet you!\u201d Jared said and kissed your cheeks and pulled you into a hug. He was tall, gorgeous and wearing some crazy Gucci clothes and gloves and sunglasses.</p><p>\u201cHarry!\u201d he shouted and hugged him too.</p><p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s get into my room,\u201d he said and you both followed him. As you all sat down in his room your mouth was still open from the shock.</p><p>\u201cSo, Harry called me a month ago. He said he wants to surprise a special girl and that our concerts will be one night apart. I said that\u2019s crazy. If you bring your girlfriend here there\u2019s a high chance that I\u2019m gonna steal her. And now seeing you there\u2019s still a big chance.\u201d he smirked.</p><p>\u201cAnd I said everybody wants to steal my girl. Find another one cause she belongs to me\u201d Harry said.</p><p>\u201cHe really did say that. I can see you both love Gucci\u201d Jared said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Harry made me. I\u2019ve never worn Gucci before I met him\u201d you smiled.</p><p>\u201cThe three of us could be the next great Gucci models and it\u2019s not a complaint. I love Lana and Alessandro. By the way Harry, we missed you at the met gala\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to give others a chance\u201d Harry smirked.</p><p>You all chatted for a bit more before a man came in asked Jared to get ready to go on stage. You and Harry took your places in the crowd but quite separated from the fans.</p><p>That night was amazing. The atmosphere was incredible and you could release a lot of stress by singing loud and jumping around. Jared winked at you several times during the concert. When it finished you went back to his room and took some cool pictures. You and Jared exchanged numbers and you saw Harry frowning. You were back in the car and you couldn\u2019t stop smiling.</p><p>\u201cHarry! Thank you so much for this!\u201d you looked at him still excited.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy if you\u2019re happy,\u201d he said softly and smiled.</p><p>When you got back to the hotel you ordered from room service and had dinner together. It was very late by that, so you were quick and both of you went to sleep asap.</p><p>Next day you remembered last night and smiled as you woke up. You uploaded two pictures on your Instagram and went down to have breakfast. Jeff was there with Glenn and Mitch with Sarah. You went to sit with them.</p><p>\u201cGood morning!\u201d They said and you greeted them too.</p><p>\u201cI saw you had fun last night,\u201d Sarah said.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d you smiled crazily.</p><p>\u201cHarry\u2019s already at MSG,\u201d Jeff said.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Shall we go together?\u201d you asked.</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ll leave at 11.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll be ready.\u201d When you finished breakfast you went back to your room to pack a few things for the day. You went down to the car in time and you left with Jeff, Mitch, and Sarah. When you arrived you were surprised that the traces of the last night were cleared. All of Harry\u2019s and MSG\u2019s crew were around making the place suitable for the concert. When you first saw Harry that day he was playing ping pong with Kacey and some others. You stopped to play with them since you had some time until your room was ready. A little later you were called to go to a meeting. The day went by and eventually, you ran into Harry.</p><p>\u201cHey! We haven\u2019t talked all day\u201d he said as he stepped into your room where you were filling papers.</p><p>\u201cHey\u201d you looked up \u201cyeah, I was kinda busy\u201d you pointed at the stack of papers.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d And here you were feeling like you two were distancing again, despite the amazing date you two had yesterday.</p><p>\u201cI &hellip;uh, I don\u2019t want to distract you from work, so I uh\u2026 I\u2019ll go find Mitch\u201d he stuttered.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I uh\u2026 I\u2019ll be here\u201d you smiled. It was awkward. He was your boyfriend and you simply let him go. No kiss, no hug. And you didn\u2019t even feel guilty. But then you remembered. \u201cDamn\u201d you mumbled to yourself and immediately went after Harry. You found him in his dressing room alone, crying. You ran to him in an instant and hugged him so tightly. No words were needed. He knew you knew. After that, you both sat down in a cuddle and haven\u2019t said a word for minutes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m such an idiot. I forgot\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. You haven\u2019t even known me a year ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love your suit. It\u2019s beautiful\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sent a picture of it and sent it to mum then I called her. She was crying\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it better if you talk about it or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI happily talk about how great he was. I loved him as my own father.\u201d he smiled. \u201cHe would\u2019ve loved you\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I forgot,\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Let\u2019s get dressed for tonight\u201d he smiled back at you. You went back to your room and quickly finished with the papers. You put on the beautiful clothes that were hanged in your room already. You went back to Harry\u2019s room and he was all dressed up in that beautiful white patterned suit. He looked like a dream.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready if you\u2019re ready,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Let\u2019s go\u201d you went to find Helene to take pictures of you two and some of Harry as he was preparing for the concert. Then it was time to go on stage. Harry was nervous, it was a \u00a0big thing for him. You were nervous too, for him. You had to go backstage for a while, but you saw most of the concert. Harry was emotional and thankful and a dork as always. It was one of the best of his shows that you\u2019ve seen.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"harrysimpact:84yOYP3rxnEVyXMzZRgruw:Zx9fux2Z77IHP\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5fa1647996c92b2e87cd56d26f1eb9f3/tumblr_paq87aKIDQ1qg6jh9o1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"sloumate:WVzzhmW9msT6ZYQJdD3KMg:ZBnoZo2Z74a5B\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1e48441b15a78d63824e7ac5df5ac7eb/tumblr_paq6kw8yRm1trprygo1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure><figure data-orig-height=\"200\" data-orig-width=\"177\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c9432fda1d49bda192a0c05c8b9ad594/tumblr_inline_pkry0iHq781vqssia_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"200\" data-orig-width=\"177\"/></figure><figure data-orig-height=\"348\" data-orig-width=\"268\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8d1224343fdb6fdeff36f8d561181045/tumblr_inline_pkry0uKABV1vqssia_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"348\" data-orig-width=\"268\"/></figure><figure data-orig-height=\"465\" data-orig-width=\"281\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ffef97deab426415b767035a2ae0f33a/tumblr_inline_pkry0pjVuq1vqssia_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"465\" data-orig-width=\"281\"/></figure><p>When the night was over everyone was quick because the next day you had to do it again. Everyone quickly went to sleep and you couldn\u2019t wait for this to be over, because you wanted to rest and talk with Harry.</p><p>Next day you all went to MSG by the morning. When Harry finally found you sitting alone on the stage, after you were hiding from him, there was no chance to run away.</p><p>\u201cLove, what&rsquo;s up? You lost in thoughts?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah! I\u2026 I was just thinking\u201d you replied.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout your performance tonight with Kacey. You know that I love this song. And I would sing it with you. But of course, I know I can&rsquo;t. She&rsquo;s the singer. And she&rsquo;s beautiful\u2026\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cIt&rsquo;s just a performance, y/n,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI know\u201d your eyes got teary.</p><p>\u201cTell me. Tell me what you think\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cShe&rsquo;s just so much better than me. Fans gonna love the rumors that you two are together. I can see the headlines now. And I&rsquo;ll just stay in the background, living in a lie\u201d it came out of your mouth.</p><p>\u201cY/n, I love you,\u201d he said and stepped closer.</p><p>\u201cI know, Harry. I love you too\u201d you said as a tear rolled down your cheek. \u201cI just wanted to live the moment with you\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but Kacey is my pre-show performer. It&rsquo;s expected to perform with her\u201d</p><p>\u201cNevermind\u201d you wiped the tears away. You were a bit angry now. Harry wanted to kiss you, but Kacey came from behind. She smiled so brightly. You tried to smile back.</p><p>\u201cWe&rsquo;re waiting for you, Harry,\u201d she said. They left together.</p><p>You stayed on stage and Sarah, Clare and Helene arrived. You had fun with the girls as you fooled around and sang a few songs. Helene showed you a picture from yesterday.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s like the one when he was younger,\u201d you said excitedly.</p><p>\u201cYes, he wanted it and we took it in the morning before you arrived,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh, I missed this moment\u201d you whined. Then Harry walked on stage behind all of you and called everyone for the end of the ping pong tournament. There was a little competition going on. You were in the top four with Harry, Kacey and a tech guy. And he planned the final games for today. Harry wore Kacey\u2019s merch and glasses. Harry didn\u2019t wear his glasses too often, but when he did, well, those days he felt really empowered. You played with him first and then with George, the tech guy and then with Kacey. It was hard to watch when Harry played with her. They spent a lot of time together recently and they had their own inner jokes. There was you, his girlfriend but you were restricted. You couldn\u2019t talk with him the way he could with Kacey. And he didn\u2019t even try hiding that he was in a great relationship with Kacey. Not a romantic one, but people assumed that she might be his girlfriend rather than you. Kacey lost and with that she was fourth. Then you played again. You were the next one to lose making you the third. Harry played the final with George. But Harry\u2019s a great player, he won the championship and the trophy. After congratulating Harry, you went to your dressing room to check the schedule.</p><p>Your dress was already there. You loved it, and Harry knew that. It was a long blue Calvin Klein dress that was long sleeved only on one side. You got some cool high heeled boots and as you put everything on, you felt so cool. You went to see Harry and met the band on the way. All of them complimented your dress and it made you feel more confident. When Helene finished photographing Harry and you, they left to go on stage. There were still a few minutes and you were supposed to be next to Harry.</p><p>\u201cJeff! Where&rsquo;s y/n?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don&rsquo;t know. She said she doesn&rsquo;t feel good, but I don&rsquo;t know where she went\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cDamn\u201d he mumbled but went on stage. You were at the VIP section first, but you entered the standing area after the concert started. You wanted to be just one of them. A fan on her favorite singer&rsquo;s concert. Harry seemed to be really happy. Well, he was excited about the performance with Kacey. And also he won in table tennis. Some fans noticed you and smiled back at you. You loved being there. You managed to reach the security line. Matt stood there. You knew him. He immediately asked if you wanna go through the barrier. You shook your head.</p><p>You were nervous about the performance with Kacey. It felt wrong to you. By the middle of the concert, you watched it from a spot that was on the way they went on stage on. After a while, Kacey appeared next to you. She looked gorgeous. You were confident about your dress, but seeing her you felt you look like a potato. She smiled at you and you smiled back. And finally, Harry announced her and they started singing. By the time they were at the chorus, you were in tears. You felt you had to leave but stayed for Harry. You were proud of him after all. But you moved a bit further because you didn\u2019t want to run into Kacey when she left the stage. The concert went on and Harry enjoyed it very much.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"675\" data-orig-width=\"379\" style=\"\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/aeb0fda31193db20de3eb35245aa3ca7/tumblr_inline_pkry0dYnRT1vqssia_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"675\" data-orig-width=\"379\"/></figure><figure data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"268\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/14d89165f1b2b34cd44c1780b0f63845/tumblr_inline_pkry0rQ1cD1vqssia_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"268\"/></figure><figure data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"268\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2d562c18b9debb8edcafa4a92ff0379d/tumblr_inline_pkry0h1YMa1vqssia_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"268\"/></figure><figure data-orig-height=\"348\" data-orig-width=\"268\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f0a15421ce17e474184d83c2288e4cbb/tumblr_inline_pkry0lws261vqssia_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"348\" data-orig-width=\"268\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"348\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"stylesinthewild:LOn-DkE_VAFK70lpIK4nFQ:Z-899i2aAcLRP\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/10bd9802671eacc092fdbcb7cd8792cf/tumblr_pcfocoARNh1v6scw1o1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"348\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"390\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"stylesinthewild:LOn-DkE_VAFK70lpIK4nFQ:Z-899i2ZZzOVw\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/093d1cd7cf262834b20ba79375f5d657/tumblr_pbgxoeKdmU1v6scw1o1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"390\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure><p>After the concert, you met Harry on the way to his dressing room.</p><p>\u201cYou did great today, I&rsquo;m proud of you!\u201d You hugged him.</p><p>\u201cFirst I thought you&rsquo;re not even there for me in that big moment\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I didn&rsquo;t miss it.\u201d Deep inside you wanted to love Harry, you couldn\u2019t just let him go.</p><p>Kacey appeared close so you released Harry.</p><p>\u201cYou were amazing Kacey!\u201d You smiled at her.</p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d She smiled back.</p><p>\u201cA question,\u201d Harry said. \u201c Why did you sing \u201cThey&rsquo;re still together\u201d?\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou two. I watched the two of you for a while. And you seemed pretty close so I talked to Sarah and Mitch. They didn&rsquo;t say anything. But their silence at the right places was enough to guess what&rsquo;s happening\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d That was surprising. You never thought that maybe Kacey is just a good friend. Maybe she wasn\u2019t the enemy after all?</p><p>\u201cDon&rsquo;t waste time! If you&rsquo;re happy together, let it be! Don&rsquo;t care about stupid bosses and other rumors.\u201d she winked and she was called from the other end of the aisle. You had to go back to your dressing room to pack your things. Harry went to his. While you were packing, Sarah came in.</p><p>\u201cCamille&rsquo;s here. Did you know that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat? No\u201d you frowned. It was a shock to you. You haven\u2019t seen her before the concert. Of course, it was a big venue and you weren\u2019t everywhere.</p><p>\u201cI saw her go into Harry&rsquo;s room,\u201d she said. \u201cJust wanted you to know\u201d she stood by the open door.</p><p>\u201cThanks!\u201d You said and she disappeared. When you finished, you walked to his room and opened it without knocking as you always did.</p><p>You were shocked at the sight. Camille cupped Harry&rsquo;s face and leaned closer as he smiled. They both looked at you suddenly. Your eyes went wide and your mouth was still open.</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m sorry\u201d you mumbled and ran out. Harry got out of the room and yelled your name. He was fit, he reached you.</p><p>\u201cY/N, it&rsquo;s not what it looked like,\u201d he said after stopping you and turning you to face him.</p><p>\u201cSod off\u201d you shrugged his hands off your shoulder and turned around to go away.</p><p>\u201cY/n, Please&quot; you turned back.</p><p>\u201cPlease what?\u201d You said and were so close you intimidated him. \u201cYou wanna tell it wasn&rsquo;t what I saw? Just because I haven&rsquo;t slept with you, you found someone else to ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don&rsquo;t care about that. I love only you\u201d he cut you off and defended himself.</p><p>\u201cOr this is how you treat people with kindness? Hmm, Harry please kiss me, sure baby, I treat everyone with kindness. You were smiling while she leaned in!!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was trying to turn her back nicely\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave me alone\u201d you started crying and ran away. This time he let you.</p><p>\u201cHarry, what the hell? Come back!\u201d Camille cooed from behind him.</p><p>\u201cGet the hell out of here Cam!\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me? I just confessed that I loved you. I thought you feel the same\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI don&rsquo;t love you like that, Cam. You were on me. I didn&rsquo;t give any signs that it&rsquo;s mutual&quot; he said firmly.</p><p>\u201cYou just needed a push\u201d she put her hands on his chest, but he took them off immediately.</p><p>\u201cI don&rsquo;t need anything from you,\u201d he said, walked past her and closed the door before she could get in. He packed everything and went to your dressing room. He knocked but there was no answer.</p><p>\u201cShe left already,\u201d Jeff said as he got there.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N left to the hotel, she seemed to be in a hurry. I hope she&rsquo;s okay\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDamn\u201d he went back to the hotel too. He knocked on your door. You sat on your bed crying your eyes out, listening to Sam Smith.</p><p>\u201cY/N, please, let me explain\u201d he shouted. You walked to the door and opened it, but sat back on the bed. You stayed silent.</p><p>\u201cI can explain. She came in out of nowhere. She said a lot of things and she admitted that she loves me and I was frozen because I didn&rsquo;t expect that from her. Then she cupped my face and tried to kiss me and I was about to remove her hands from me when you walked in\u201d he said. He seemed to be really sorry.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that? He asked.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I believe it\u201d you shrugged. Harry opened his mouth to speak, but you stopped him.</p><p>\u201cI need to think, Harry\u201d you looked down at your fingers that were tracing the hem of your shirt. \u201cThese things lately were too much for me. I love you, Harry, with all my heart, but these troubles recently sucked my energy. I need to think about this situation we&rsquo;re in\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cY/N, I love you,\u201d he said and tried to reach your hand but you pulled away. He looked down and you saw a tear fell on his knee.</p><p>\u201cI guess you don&rsquo;t want me to sleep here tonight\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, can you please leave?\u201d you asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah\u201d he whispered. He stood up.</p><p>\u201cWait, Harry!\u201d you said and he turned back immediately hoping that you changed your mind.</p><p>\u201cThat&rsquo;s yours\u201d you pointed at a little gift bag. He grabbed it.</p><p>\u201cWhat&rsquo;s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurtle shaped bubble bath from Lush. I bought it for you a few days ago\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d He left. His heart was broken just like yours. You needed a hug though, but you couldn&rsquo;t just go to Harry, Louis wasn\u2019t in town. You stood up, grabbed your phone and left the room. You knocked. Sarah opened the door.</p><p>\u201cOh, girl! You look bad! \u201c She said.</p><p>\u201cThanks!\u201d she let you in. Mitch sat on the bed and probably they were watching a movie together.</p><p>\u201cSarah, do you mind if I cuddle your boyfriend? I really need a Mitch hug\u201d She chuckled.</p><p>\u201cNo, Harry does that without asking for permission,\u201d she said. You sat next to Mitch, Sarah on his other side and you hugged Mitch.</p><p>\u201cWhat&rsquo;s up, girl? Haven&rsquo;t seen you this bad\u201d Mitch said as he wrapped his arm around you.</p><p>\u201cI don&rsquo;t want to talk about it,\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cI know you do. Maybe we don&rsquo;t know each other for years, but I know you enough to know, you&rsquo;re here to cuddle and talk\u201d he said. And really, after Harry, Mitch knew you most from the band and crew. You became friends just as fast as with Harry.</p><p>\u201cIs it Harry?\u201d he asked and you nodded, your face rubbing against his tee.</p><p>\u201cI don&rsquo;t know if I can be with him,\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cWait, are you dating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on! You already knew\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. Don&rsquo;t eat me\u201d he chuckled.</p><p>\u201cIt&rsquo;s getting too much. You know him, he&rsquo;s free, he does what he wants, and it&rsquo;s okay, but living in this secret relationship, girls hitting on him constantly. I don&rsquo;t take it well\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cDear, Harry loves you. He talks to me every day and he always tells me how much he loves you. He has bold moves. He is who he is. He&rsquo;ll always be a little extreme. But I know you love him too. I look at the two of you and I see two lovebirds being so happy to be together\u201d he said. You were in tears again.</p><p>\u201cGive him a chance. Harry never forgets the people he loves or loved. Those people have a special place in his heart. And I&rsquo;m sure your place in his heart is more special than mine or Anne&rsquo;s or anyone else&rsquo;s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mitch. I will think about him, but I\u2019m really mad at him right now\u201d you said as you wiped your tears away. You heard Sarah sniffling too.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Mitch said. You stayed there for a while, but then you went back to your room. You walked past Harry&rsquo;s room and you saw the light under the door. He was picking the guitar softly you could hear. You stood there for a while, thinking about going in. But you let him be instead and got back to your room.</p>",

Harry, I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m\u2026 I should be happy, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I thought it\u2019s gonna upset you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but why? Part of me is proud of you. Singing that song in Madison Square Garden. That was your dream, Harry. I am proud of you. But I feel an ache in my heart. Because you know that I wanted to sing that with you. And it happened before that I sang with you on stage this tour. So, you can\u2019t say that you\u2019re singing with her just because you don\u2019t want to fuel rumors around us. And you were a lot with her recently. And my silly heart says that you might be more interested in her than in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No. We were a lot together just to make this performance happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But feelings are like a flower they grow if you water them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, if you want \u00a0to be alone\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019d like to\u201d you sighed.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to have dinner with me and the band?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Call me when you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks\u201d he was already by the door.</p><p>\u201cAnd y/n.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d he left before you could say anything.</p><p>You didn\u2019t need things to be more messed up right now. In two days Harry will do two shows at Madison Square Garden, you have a lot of work to do, this is a huge thing. You didn\u2019t need this. You tried to cool down a bit before dinner. You took a hot bath with a relaxing bath bomb. It was a turtle-shaped bath bomb you bought in Lush. One for Harry and one for you. You listened to some relaxing music and let fresh air into the room. These things made you a little more relaxed. Harry rang you and you went down to the restaurant to have dinner. Clare, Adam, Sarah, and Mitch were already there and you arrived with Harry. It was all fun, but you knew Sarah noticed something\u2019s off.</p><p>Sarah: wanna talk about it after dinner?</p><p>You: we can. My room</p><p>You texted back under the table. When you all finished you went back to your room and Sarah followed you.</p><p>\u201cHey! I noticed something\u2019s wrong. What\u2019s up?\u201d she asked while she hopped on your bed.</p><p>\u201cYou knew that Harry\u2019s gonna perform with Kacey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I uhm.. I\u2019m the drummer\u2026\u201d she said looking down like it was her fault too.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why but I feel so bad. I feel\u2026 that\u2026. I don\u2019t know, I might be jealous. I thought Harry would sing that song with me and not her\u201d you burst out.</p><p>\u201cBut wouldn\u2019t that make you more suspicious?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve sung together on stage on this tour before. I don\u2019t see why it would be a problem. And she\u2019s around Kacey a lot lately\u201d she hugged you. You felt tears on your cheeks. \u201cIf I were around some guy, he\u2019d be following my every step and making sure that I don\u2019t spend extra time with anyone over the necessary. But if it\u2019s him it\u2019s nothing\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand you, dear. Tell him what you feel and maybe you can talk it through or solve it somehow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I have to, but I\u2019ll leave it for when we finished in New York. These days are too busy. What could happen in two days?\u201d</p><p>Next day you had some work with the managers and you all met in the hotel\u2019s conference room while you knew Harry was out with Mitch in some music stores. The meeting was finished at 1 pm and you decided to have lunch with Jeff and the tour manager. Harry texted you that your date is tonight and you should wear something hot so you\u2019re going shopping as soon as you\u2019re ready. You totally forgot about the date, but you were happy you\u2019re going shopping because you had no idea what to wear. Harry guided you to denim and t-shirts which made you think that it\u2019s not gonna be a fancy restaurant date. In the end, you bought an oversize black Gucci tee, black skinny pants with the New York Yankees patch and a pink sequins bomber jacket. Back in the hotel, you matched it with your Gucci loafers and some cool earrings and rings. Harry was really satisfied with that and he chose casual Gucci to wear too. You left the hotel at about six and went by a tour car.</p><p>\u201cUhm\u2026 we have to stop at MSG first\u201d Harry said.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there a concert tonight? Why do you have to go there?\u201d you asked but he stayed silent and you didn\u2019t want to ask again. Harry parked the car in the parking garage. When you got out of the car Harry stopped you.</p><p>\u201cHey! This is my gift for you. I love you and I planned this for so long\u201d he smiled.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d you asked looking around.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go through that door and you\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He locked the car and took you by the hand. When he opened the door you didn\u2019t understand first. It was a back entrance and you saw people going around crazy. You saw a security guard that was going to stop you.</p><p>\u201cSir, lady, can I see your admission cards?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOh shoot! Yes of course!\u201d Harry said and took two neck straps with the cards on the ends.</p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d the man said. Harry hid the cards.</p><p>\u201cHarry, would you tell me what\u2019s going on?\u201d you asked impatiently.</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d you heard someone yell from behind. You slowly turned around to see the body of the familiar voice.</p><p>\u201cHoly\u2026!\u201d you cried out. Jared Leto was pacing through the crowd of people in your direction. You looked at Harry. He smirked.</p><p>\u201cY/N, I couldn\u2019t wait to finally meet you!\u201d Jared said and kissed your cheeks and pulled you into a hug. He was tall, gorgeous and wearing some crazy Gucci clothes and gloves and sunglasses.</p><p>\u201cHarry!\u201d he shouted and hugged him too.</p><p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s get into my room,\u201d he said and you both followed him. As you all sat down in his room your mouth was still open from the shock.</p><p>\u201cSo, Harry called me a month ago. He said he wants to surprise a special girl and that our concerts will be one night apart. I said that\u2019s crazy. If you bring your girlfriend here there\u2019s a high chance that I\u2019m gonna steal her. And now seeing you there\u2019s still a big chance.\u201d he smirked.</p><p>\u201cAnd I said everybody wants to steal my girl. Find another one cause she belongs to me\u201d Harry said.</p><p>\u201cHe really did say that. I can see you both love Gucci\u201d Jared said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Harry made me. I\u2019ve never worn Gucci before I met him\u201d you smiled.</p><p>\u201cThe three of us could be the next great Gucci models and it\u2019s not a complaint. I love Lana and Alessandro. By the way Harry, we missed you at the met gala\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to give others a chance\u201d Harry smirked.</p><p>You all chatted for a bit more before a man came in asked Jared to get ready to go on stage. You and Harry took your places in the crowd but quite separated from the fans.</p><p>That night was amazing. The atmosphere was incredible and you could release a lot of stress by singing loud and jumping around. Jared winked at you several times during the concert. When it finished you went back to his room and took some cool pictures. You and Jared exchanged numbers and you saw Harry frowning. You were back in the car and you couldn\u2019t stop smiling.</p><p>\u201cHarry! Thank you so much for this!\u201d you looked at him still excited.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy if you\u2019re happy,\u201d he said softly and smiled.</p><p>When you got back to the hotel you ordered from room service and had dinner together. It was very late by that, so you were quick and both of you went to sleep asap.</p><p>Next day you remembered last night and smiled as you woke up. You uploaded two pictures on your Instagram and went down to have breakfast. Jeff was there with Glenn and Mitch with Sarah. You went to sit with them.</p><p>\u201cGood morning!\u201d They said and you greeted them too.</p><p>\u201cI saw you had fun last night,\u201d Sarah said.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d you smiled crazily.</p><p>\u201cHarry\u2019s already at MSG,\u201d Jeff said.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Shall we go together?\u201d you asked.</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ll leave at 11.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll be ready.\u201d When you finished breakfast you went back to your room to pack a few things for the day. You went down to the car in time and you left with Jeff, Mitch, and Sarah. When you arrived you were surprised that the traces of the last night were cleared. All of Harry\u2019s and MSG\u2019s crew were around making the place suitable for the concert. When you first saw Harry that day he was playing ping pong with Kacey and some others. You stopped to play with them since you had some time until your room was ready. A little later you were called to go to a meeting. The day went by and eventually, you ran into Harry.</p><p>\u201cHey! We haven\u2019t talked all day\u201d he said as he stepped into your room where you were filling papers.</p><p>\u201cHey\u201d you looked up \u201cyeah, I was kinda busy\u201d you pointed at the stack of papers.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d And here you were feeling like you two were distancing again, despite the amazing date you two had yesterday.</p><p>\u201cI \u2026uh, I don\u2019t want to distract you from work, so I uh\u2026 I\u2019ll go find Mitch\u201d he stuttered.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I uh\u2026 I\u2019ll be here\u201d you smiled. It was awkward. He was your boyfriend and you simply let him go. No kiss, no hug. And you didn\u2019t even feel guilty. But then you remembered. \u201cDamn\u201d you mumbled to yourself and immediately went after Harry. You found him in his dressing room alone, crying. You ran to him in an instant and hugged him so tightly. No words were needed. He knew you knew. After that, you both sat down in a cuddle and haven\u2019t said a word for minutes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m such an idiot. I forgot\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. You haven\u2019t even known me a year ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love your suit. It\u2019s beautiful\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sent a picture of it and sent it to mum then I called her. She was crying\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it better if you talk about it or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI happily talk about how great he was. I loved him as my own father.\u201d he smiled. \u201cHe would\u2019ve loved you\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I forgot,\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Let\u2019s get dressed for tonight\u201d he smiled back at you. You went back to your room and quickly finished with the papers. You put on the beautiful clothes that were hanged in your room already. You went back to Harry\u2019s room and he was all dressed up in that beautiful white patterned suit. He looked like a dream.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready if you\u2019re ready,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Let\u2019s go\u201d you went to find Helene to take pictures of you two and some of Harry as he was preparing for the concert. Then it was time to go on stage. Harry was nervous, it was a \u00a0big thing for him. You were nervous too, for him. You had to go backstage for a while, but you saw most of the concert. Harry was emotional and thankful and a dork as always. It was one of the best of his shows that you\u2019ve seen.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"harrysimpact:84yOYP3rxnEVyXMzZRgruw:Zx9fux2Z77IHP\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5fa1647996c92b2e87cd56d26f1eb9f3/tumblr_paq87aKIDQ1qg6jh9o1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"sloumate:WVzzhmW9msT6ZYQJdD3KMg:ZBnoZo2Z74a5B\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1e48441b15a78d63824e7ac5df5ac7eb/tumblr_paq6kw8yRm1trprygo1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><figure data-orig-height=\"200\" data-orig-width=\"177\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c9432fda1d49bda192a0c05c8b9ad594/tumblr_inline_pkry0iHq781vqssia_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"200\" data-orig-width=\"177\"></figure><figure data-orig-height=\"348\" data-orig-width=\"268\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8d1224343fdb6fdeff36f8d561181045/tumblr_inline_pkry0uKABV1vqssia_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"348\" data-orig-width=\"268\"></figure><figure data-orig-height=\"465\" data-orig-width=\"281\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ffef97deab426415b767035a2ae0f33a/tumblr_inline_pkry0pjVuq1vqssia_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"465\" data-orig-width=\"281\"></figure><p>When the night was over everyone was quick because the next day you had to do it again. Everyone quickly went to sleep and you couldn\u2019t wait for this to be over, because you wanted to rest and talk with Harry.</p><p>Next day you all went to MSG by the morning. When Harry finally found you sitting alone on the stage, after you were hiding from him, there was no chance to run away.</p><p>\u201cLove, what\u2019s up? You lost in thoughts?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah! I\u2026 I was just thinking\u201d you replied.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout your performance tonight with Kacey. You know that I love this song. And I would sing it with you. But of course, I know I can\u2019t. She\u2019s the singer. And she\u2019s beautiful\u2026\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a performance, y/n,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI know\u201d your eyes got teary.</p><p>\u201cTell me. Tell me what you think\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just so much better than me. Fans gonna love the rumors that you two are together. I can see the headlines now. And I\u2019ll just stay in the background, living in a lie\u201d it came out of your mouth.</p><p>\u201cY/n, I love you,\u201d he said and stepped closer.</p><p>\u201cI know, Harry. I love you too\u201d you said as a tear rolled down your cheek. \u201cI just wanted to live the moment with you\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but Kacey is my pre-show performer. It\u2019s expected to perform with her\u201d</p><p>\u201cNevermind\u201d you wiped the tears away. You were a bit angry now. Harry wanted to kiss you, but Kacey came from behind. She smiled so brightly. You tried to smile back.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re waiting for you, Harry,\u201d she said. They left together.</p><p>You stayed on stage and Sarah, Clare and Helene arrived. You had fun with the girls as you fooled around and sang a few songs. Helene showed you a picture from yesterday.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s like the one when he was younger,\u201d you said excitedly.</p><p>\u201cYes, he wanted it and we took it in the morning before you arrived,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh, I missed this moment\u201d you whined. Then Harry walked on stage behind all of you and called everyone for the end of the ping pong tournament. There was a little competition going on. You were in the top four with Harry, Kacey and a tech guy. And he planned the final games for today. Harry wore Kacey\u2019s merch and glasses. Harry didn\u2019t wear his glasses too often, but when he did, well, those days he felt really empowered. You played with him first and then with George, the tech guy and then with Kacey. It was hard to watch when Harry played with her. They spent a lot of time together recently and they had their own inner jokes. There was you, his girlfriend but you were restricted. You couldn\u2019t talk with him the way he could with Kacey. And he didn\u2019t even try hiding that he was in a great relationship with Kacey. Not a romantic one, but people assumed that she might be his girlfriend rather than you. Kacey lost and with that she was fourth. Then you played again. You were the next one to lose making you the third. Harry played the final with George. But Harry\u2019s a great player, he won the championship and the trophy. After congratulating Harry, you went to your dressing room to check the schedule.</p><p>Your dress was already there. You loved it, and Harry knew that. It was a long blue Calvin Klein dress that was long sleeved only on one side. You got some cool high heeled boots and as you put everything on, you felt so cool. You went to see Harry and met the band on the way. All of them complimented your dress and it made you feel more confident. When Helene finished photographing Harry and you, they left to go on stage. There were still a few minutes and you were supposed to be next to Harry.</p><p>\u201cJeff! Where\u2019s y/n?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. She said she doesn\u2019t feel good, but I don\u2019t know where she went\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cDamn\u201d he mumbled but went on stage. You were at the VIP section first, but you entered the standing area after the concert started. You wanted to be just one of them. A fan on her favorite singer\u2019s concert. Harry seemed to be really happy. Well, he was excited about the performance with Kacey. And also he won in table tennis. Some fans noticed you and smiled back at you. You loved being there. You managed to reach the security line. Matt stood there. You knew him. He immediately asked if you wanna go through the barrier. You shook your head.</p><p>You were nervous about the performance with Kacey. It felt wrong to you. By the middle of the concert, you watched it from a spot that was on the way they went on stage on. After a while, Kacey appeared next to you. She looked gorgeous. You were confident about your dress, but seeing her you felt you look like a potato. She smiled at you and you smiled back. And finally, Harry announced her and they started singing. By the time they were at the chorus, you were in tears. You felt you had to leave but stayed for Harry. You were proud of him after all. But you moved a bit further because you didn\u2019t want to run into Kacey when she left the stage. The concert went on and Harry enjoyed it very much.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"675\" data-orig-width=\"379\" style=\"\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/aeb0fda31193db20de3eb35245aa3ca7/tumblr_inline_pkry0dYnRT1vqssia_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"675\" data-orig-width=\"379\"></figure><figure data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"268\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/14d89165f1b2b34cd44c1780b0f63845/tumblr_inline_pkry0rQ1cD1vqssia_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"268\"></figure><figure data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"268\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2d562c18b9debb8edcafa4a92ff0379d/tumblr_inline_pkry0h1YMa1vqssia_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"268\"></figure><figure data-orig-height=\"348\" data-orig-width=\"268\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f0a15421ce17e474184d83c2288e4cbb/tumblr_inline_pkry0lws261vqssia_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"348\" data-orig-width=\"268\"></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"348\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"stylesinthewild:LOn-DkE_VAFK70lpIK4nFQ:Z-899i2aAcLRP\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/10bd9802671eacc092fdbcb7cd8792cf/tumblr_pcfocoARNh1v6scw1o1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"348\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"390\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"stylesinthewild:LOn-DkE_VAFK70lpIK4nFQ:Z-899i2ZZzOVw\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/093d1cd7cf262834b20ba79375f5d657/tumblr_pbgxoeKdmU1v6scw1o1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"390\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p>After the concert, you met Harry on the way to his dressing room.</p><p>\u201cYou did great today, I\u2019m proud of you!\u201d You hugged him.</p><p>\u201cFirst I thought you\u2019re not even there for me in that big moment\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I didn\u2019t miss it.\u201d Deep inside you wanted to love Harry, you couldn\u2019t just let him go.</p><p>Kacey appeared close so you released Harry.</p><p>\u201cYou were amazing Kacey!\u201d You smiled at her.</p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d She smiled back.</p><p>\u201cA question,\u201d Harry said. \u201c Why did you sing \u201cThey\u2019re still together\u201d?\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou two. I watched the two of you for a while. And you seemed pretty close so I talked to Sarah and Mitch. They didn\u2019t say anything. But their silence at the right places was enough to guess what\u2019s happening\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d That was surprising. You never thought that maybe Kacey is just a good friend. Maybe she wasn\u2019t the enemy after all?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t waste time! If you\u2019re happy together, let it be! Don\u2019t care about stupid bosses and other rumors.\u201d she winked and she was called from the other end of the aisle. You had to go back to your dressing room to pack your things. Harry went to his. While you were packing, Sarah came in.</p><p>\u201cCamille\u2019s here. Did you know that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat? No\u201d you frowned. It was a shock to you. You haven\u2019t seen her before the concert. Of course, it was a big venue and you weren\u2019t everywhere.</p><p>\u201cI saw her go into Harry\u2019s room,\u201d she said. \u201cJust wanted you to know\u201d she stood by the open door.</p><p>\u201cThanks!\u201d You said and she disappeared. When you finished, you walked to his room and opened it without knocking as you always did.</p><p>You were shocked at the sight. Camille cupped Harry\u2019s face and leaned closer as he smiled. They both looked at you suddenly. Your eyes went wide and your mouth was still open.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d you mumbled and ran out. Harry got out of the room and yelled your name. He was fit, he reached you.</p><p>\u201cY/N, it\u2019s not what it looked like,\u201d he said after stopping you and turning you to face him.</p><p>\u201cSod off\u201d you shrugged his hands off your shoulder and turned around to go away.</p><p>\u201cY/n, Please\" you turned back.</p><p>\u201cPlease what?\u201d You said and were so close you intimidated him. \u201cYou wanna tell it wasn\u2019t what I saw? Just because I haven\u2019t slept with you, you found someone else to ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t care about that. I love only you\u201d he cut you off and defended himself.</p><p>\u201cOr this is how you treat people with kindness? Hmm, Harry please kiss me, sure baby, I treat everyone with kindness. You were smiling while she leaned in!!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was trying to turn her back nicely\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave me alone\u201d you started crying and ran away. This time he let you.</p><p>\u201cHarry, what the hell? Come back!\u201d Camille cooed from behind him.</p><p>\u201cGet the hell out of here Cam!\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me? I just confessed that I loved you. I thought you feel the same\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t love you like that, Cam. You were on me. I didn\u2019t give any signs that it\u2019s mutual\" he said firmly.</p><p>\u201cYou just needed a push\u201d she put her hands on his chest, but he took them off immediately.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need anything from you,\u201d he said, walked past her and closed the door before she could get in. He packed everything and went to your dressing room. He knocked but there was no answer.</p><p>\u201cShe left already,\u201d Jeff said as he got there.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N left to the hotel, she seemed to be in a hurry. I hope she\u2019s okay\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDamn\u201d he went back to the hotel too. He knocked on your door. You sat on your bed crying your eyes out, listening to Sam Smith.</p><p>\u201cY/N, please, let me explain\u201d he shouted. You walked to the door and opened it, but sat back on the bed. You stayed silent.</p><p>\u201cI can explain. She came in out of nowhere. She said a lot of things and she admitted that she loves me and I was frozen because I didn\u2019t expect that from her. Then she cupped my face and tried to kiss me and I was about to remove her hands from me when you walked in\u201d he said. He seemed to be really sorry.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that? He asked.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I believe it\u201d you shrugged. Harry opened his mouth to speak, but you stopped him.</p><p>\u201cI need to think, Harry\u201d you looked down at your fingers that were tracing the hem of your shirt. \u201cThese things lately were too much for me. I love you, Harry, with all my heart, but these troubles recently sucked my energy. I need to think about this situation we\u2019re in\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cY/N, I love you,\u201d he said and tried to reach your hand but you pulled away. He looked down and you saw a tear fell on his knee.</p><p>\u201cI guess you don\u2019t want me to sleep here tonight\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, can you please leave?\u201d you asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah\u201d he whispered. He stood up.</p><p>\u201cWait, Harry!\u201d you said and he turned back immediately hoping that you changed your mind.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s yours\u201d you pointed at a little gift bag. He grabbed it.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurtle shaped bubble bath from Lush. I bought it for you a few days ago\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d He left. His heart was broken just like yours. You needed a hug though, but you couldn\u2019t just go to Harry, Louis wasn\u2019t in town. You stood up, grabbed your phone and left the room. You knocked. Sarah opened the door.</p><p>\u201cOh, girl! You look bad! \u201c She said.</p><p>\u201cThanks!\u201d she let you in. Mitch sat on the bed and probably they were watching a movie together.</p><p>\u201cSarah, do you mind if I cuddle your boyfriend? I really need a Mitch hug\u201d She chuckled.</p><p>\u201cNo, Harry does that without asking for permission,\u201d she said. You sat next to Mitch, Sarah on his other side and you hugged Mitch.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, girl? Haven\u2019t seen you this bad\u201d Mitch said as he wrapped his arm around you.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it,\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cI know you do. Maybe we don\u2019t know each other for years, but I know you enough to know, you\u2019re here to cuddle and talk\u201d he said. And really, after Harry, Mitch knew you most from the band and crew. You became friends just as fast as with Harry.</p><p>\u201cIs it Harry?\u201d he asked and you nodded, your face rubbing against his tee.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can be with him,\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cWait, are you dating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on! You already knew\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. Don\u2019t eat me\u201d he chuckled.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s getting too much. You know him, he\u2019s free, he does what he wants, and it\u2019s okay, but living in this secret relationship, girls hitting on him constantly. I don\u2019t take it well\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cDear, Harry loves you. He talks to me every day and he always tells me how much he loves you. He has bold moves. He is who he is. He\u2019ll always be a little extreme. But I know you love him too. I look at the two of you and I see two lovebirds being so happy to be together\u201d he said. You were in tears again.</p><p>\u201cGive him a chance. Harry never forgets the people he loves or loved. Those people have a special place in his heart. And I\u2019m sure your place in his heart is more special than mine or Anne\u2019s or anyone else\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mitch. I will think about him, but I\u2019m really mad at him right now\u201d you said as you wiped your tears away. You heard Sarah sniffling too.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Mitch said. You stayed there for a while, but then you went back to your room. You walked past Harry\u2019s room and you saw the light under the door. He was picking the guitar softly you could hear. You stood there for a while, thinking about going in. But you let him be instead and got back to your room.</p>",

Harry, I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m\u2026 I should be happy, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I thought it\u2019s gonna upset you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but why? Part of me is proud of you. Singing that song in Madison Square Garden. That was your dream, Harry. I am proud of you. But I feel an ache in my heart. Because you know that I wanted to sing that with you. And it happened before that I sang with you on stage this tour. So, you can\u2019t say that you\u2019re singing with her just because you don\u2019t want to fuel rumors around us. And you were a lot with her recently. And my silly heart says that you might be more interested in her than in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No. We were a lot together just to make this performance happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But feelings are like a flower they grow if you water them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, if you want \u00a0to be alone\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019d like to\u201d you sighed.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to have dinner with me and the band?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Call me when you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks\u201d he was already by the door.</p><p>\u201cAnd y/n.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d he left before you could say anything.</p><p>You didn\u2019t need things to be more messed up right now. In two days Harry will do two shows at Madison Square Garden, you have a lot of work to do, this is a huge thing. You didn\u2019t need this. You tried to cool down a bit before dinner. You took a hot bath with a relaxing bath bomb. It was a turtle-shaped bath bomb you bought in Lush. One for Harry and one for you. You listened to some relaxing music and let fresh air into the room. These things made you a little more relaxed. Harry rang you and you went down to the restaurant to have dinner. Clare, Adam, Sarah, and Mitch were already there and you arrived with Harry. It was all fun, but you knew Sarah noticed something\u2019s off.</p><p>Sarah: wanna talk about it after dinner?</p><p>You: we can. My room</p><p>You texted back under the table. When you all finished you went back to your room and Sarah followed you.</p><p>\u201cHey! I noticed something\u2019s wrong. What\u2019s up?\u201d she asked while she hopped on your bed.</p><p>\u201cYou knew that Harry\u2019s gonna perform with Kacey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I uhm.. I\u2019m the drummer\u2026\u201d she said looking down like it was her fault too.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why but I feel so bad. I feel\u2026 that\u2026. I don\u2019t know, I might be jealous. I thought Harry would sing that song with me and not her\u201d you burst out.</p><p>\u201cBut wouldn\u2019t that make you more suspicious?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve sung together on stage on this tour before. I don\u2019t see why it would be a problem. And she\u2019s around Kacey a lot lately\u201d she hugged you. You felt tears on your cheeks. \u201cIf I were around some guy, he\u2019d be following my every step and making sure that I don\u2019t spend extra time with anyone over the necessary. But if it\u2019s him it\u2019s nothing\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand you, dear. Tell him what you feel and maybe you can talk it through or solve it somehow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I have to, but I\u2019ll leave it for when we finished in New York. These days are too busy. What could happen in two days?\u201d</p><p>Next day you had some work with the managers and you all met in the hotel\u2019s conference room while you knew Harry was out with Mitch in some music stores. The meeting was finished at 1 pm and you decided to have lunch with Jeff and the tour manager. Harry texted you that your date is tonight and you should wear something hot so you\u2019re going shopping as soon as you\u2019re ready. You totally forgot about the date, but you were happy you\u2019re going shopping because you had no idea what to wear. Harry guided you to denim and t-shirts which made you think that it\u2019s not gonna be a fancy restaurant date. In the end, you bought an oversize black Gucci tee, black skinny pants with the New York Yankees patch and a pink sequins bomber jacket. Back in the hotel, you matched it with your Gucci loafers and some cool earrings and rings. Harry was really satisfied with that and he chose casual Gucci to wear too. You left the hotel at about six and went by a tour car.</p><p>\u201cUhm\u2026 we have to stop at MSG first\u201d Harry said.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there a concert tonight? Why do you have to go there?\u201d you asked but he stayed silent and you didn\u2019t want to ask again. Harry parked the car in the parking garage. When you got out of the car Harry stopped you.</p><p>\u201cHey! This is my gift for you. I love you and I planned this for so long\u201d he smiled.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d you asked looking around.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go through that door and you\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He locked the car and took you by the hand. When he opened the door you didn\u2019t understand first. It was a back entrance and you saw people going around crazy. You saw a security guard that was going to stop you.</p><p>\u201cSir, lady, can I see your admission cards?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOh shoot! Yes of course!\u201d Harry said and took two neck straps with the cards on the ends.</p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d the man said. Harry hid the cards.</p><p>\u201cHarry, would you tell me what\u2019s going on?\u201d you asked impatiently.</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d you heard someone yell from behind. You slowly turned around to see the body of the familiar voice.</p><p>\u201cHoly\u2026!\u201d you cried out. Jared Leto was pacing through the crowd of people in your direction. You looked at Harry. He smirked.</p><p>\u201cY/N, I couldn\u2019t wait to finally meet you!\u201d Jared said and kissed your cheeks and pulled you into a hug. He was tall, gorgeous and wearing some crazy Gucci clothes and gloves and sunglasses.</p><p>\u201cHarry!\u201d he shouted and hugged him too.</p><p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s get into my room,\u201d he said and you both followed him. As you all sat down in his room your mouth was still open from the shock.</p><p>\u201cSo, Harry called me a month ago. He said he wants to surprise a special girl and that our concerts will be one night apart. I said that\u2019s crazy. If you bring your girlfriend here there\u2019s a high chance that I\u2019m gonna steal her. And now seeing you there\u2019s still a big chance.\u201d he smirked.</p><p>\u201cAnd I said everybody wants to steal my girl. Find another one cause she belongs to me\u201d Harry said.</p><p>\u201cHe really did say that. I can see you both love Gucci\u201d Jared said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Harry made me. I\u2019ve never worn Gucci before I met him\u201d you smiled.</p><p>\u201cThe three of us could be the next great Gucci models and it\u2019s not a complaint. I love Lana and Alessandro. By the way Harry, we missed you at the met gala\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to give others a chance\u201d Harry smirked.</p><p>You all chatted for a bit more before a man came in asked Jared to get ready to go on stage. You and Harry took your places in the crowd but quite separated from the fans.</p><p>That night was amazing. The atmosphere was incredible and you could release a lot of stress by singing loud and jumping around. Jared winked at you several times during the concert. When it finished you went back to his room and took some cool pictures. You and Jared exchanged numbers and you saw Harry frowning. You were back in the car and you couldn\u2019t stop smiling.</p><p>\u201cHarry! Thank you so much for this!\u201d you looked at him still excited.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy if you\u2019re happy,\u201d he said softly and smiled.</p><p>When you got back to the hotel you ordered from room service and had dinner together. It was very late by that, so you were quick and both of you went to sleep asap.</p><p>Next day you remembered last night and smiled as you woke up. You uploaded two pictures on your Instagram and went down to have breakfast. Jeff was there with Glenn and Mitch with Sarah. You went to sit with them.</p><p>\u201cGood morning!\u201d They said and you greeted them too.</p><p>\u201cI saw you had fun last night,\u201d Sarah said.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d you smiled crazily.</p><p>\u201cHarry\u2019s already at MSG,\u201d Jeff said.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Shall we go together?\u201d you asked.</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ll leave at 11.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll be ready.\u201d When you finished breakfast you went back to your room to pack a few things for the day. You went down to the car in time and you left with Jeff, Mitch, and Sarah. When you arrived you were surprised that the traces of the last night were cleared. All of Harry\u2019s and MSG\u2019s crew were around making the place suitable for the concert. When you first saw Harry that day he was playing ping pong with Kacey and some others. You stopped to play with them since you had some time until your room was ready. A little later you were called to go to a meeting. The day went by and eventually, you ran into Harry.</p><p>\u201cHey! We haven\u2019t talked all day\u201d he said as he stepped into your room where you were filling papers.</p><p>\u201cHey\u201d you looked up \u201cyeah, I was kinda busy\u201d you pointed at the stack of papers.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d And here you were feeling like you two were distancing again, despite the amazing date you two had yesterday.</p><p>\u201cI \u2026uh, I don\u2019t want to distract you from work, so I uh\u2026 I\u2019ll go find Mitch\u201d he stuttered.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I uh\u2026 I\u2019ll be here\u201d you smiled. It was awkward. He was your boyfriend and you simply let him go. No kiss, no hug. And you didn\u2019t even feel guilty. But then you remembered. \u201cDamn\u201d you mumbled to yourself and immediately went after Harry. You found him in his dressing room alone, crying. You ran to him in an instant and hugged him so tightly. No words were needed. He knew you knew. After that, you both sat down in a cuddle and haven\u2019t said a word for minutes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m such an idiot. I forgot\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. You haven\u2019t even known me a year ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love your suit. It\u2019s beautiful\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sent a picture of it and sent it to mum then I called her. She was crying\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it better if you talk about it or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI happily talk about how great he was. I loved him as my own father.\u201d he smiled. \u201cHe would\u2019ve loved you\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I forgot,\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Let\u2019s get dressed for tonight\u201d he smiled back at you. You went back to your room and quickly finished with the papers. You put on the beautiful clothes that were hanged in your room already. You went back to Harry\u2019s room and he was all dressed up in that beautiful white patterned suit. He looked like a dream.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready if you\u2019re ready,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Let\u2019s go\u201d you went to find Helene to take pictures of you two and some of Harry as he was preparing for the concert. Then it was time to go on stage. Harry was nervous, it was a \u00a0big thing for him. You were nervous too, for him. You had to go backstage for a while, but you saw most of the concert. Harry was emotional and thankful and a dork as always. It was one of the best of his shows that you\u2019ve seen.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"harrysimpact:84yOYP3rxnEVyXMzZRgruw:Zx9fux2Z77IHP\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5fa1647996c92b2e87cd56d26f1eb9f3/tumblr_paq87aKIDQ1qg6jh9o1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"sloumate:WVzzhmW9msT6ZYQJdD3KMg:ZBnoZo2Z74a5B\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1e48441b15a78d63824e7ac5df5ac7eb/tumblr_paq6kw8yRm1trprygo1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><figure data-orig-height=\"200\" data-orig-width=\"177\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c9432fda1d49bda192a0c05c8b9ad594/tumblr_inline_pkry0iHq781vqssia_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"200\" data-orig-width=\"177\"></figure><figure data-orig-height=\"348\" data-orig-width=\"268\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8d1224343fdb6fdeff36f8d561181045/tumblr_inline_pkry0uKABV1vqssia_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"348\" data-orig-width=\"268\"></figure><figure data-orig-height=\"465\" data-orig-width=\"281\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ffef97deab426415b767035a2ae0f33a/tumblr_inline_pkry0pjVuq1vqssia_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"465\" data-orig-width=\"281\"></figure><p>When the night was over everyone was quick because the next day you had to do it again. Everyone quickly went to sleep and you couldn\u2019t wait for this to be over, because you wanted to rest and talk with Harry.</p><p>Next day you all went to MSG by the morning. When Harry finally found you sitting alone on the stage, after you were hiding from him, there was no chance to run away.</p><p>\u201cLove, what\u2019s up? You lost in thoughts?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah! I\u2026 I was just thinking\u201d you replied.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout your performance tonight with Kacey. You know that I love this song. And I would sing it with you. But of course, I know I can\u2019t. She\u2019s the singer. And she\u2019s beautiful\u2026\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a performance, y/n,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI know\u201d your eyes got teary.</p><p>\u201cTell me. Tell me what you think\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just so much better than me. Fans gonna love the rumors that you two are together. I can see the headlines now. And I\u2019ll just stay in the background, living in a lie\u201d it came out of your mouth.</p><p>\u201cY/n, I love you,\u201d he said and stepped closer.</p><p>\u201cI know, Harry. I love you too\u201d you said as a tear rolled down your cheek. \u201cI just wanted to live the moment with you\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but Kacey is my pre-show performer. It\u2019s expected to perform with her\u201d</p><p>\u201cNevermind\u201d you wiped the tears away. You were a bit angry now. Harry wanted to kiss you, but Kacey came from behind. She smiled so brightly. You tried to smile back.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re waiting for you, Harry,\u201d she said. They left together.</p><p>You stayed on stage and Sarah, Clare and Helene arrived. You had fun with the girls as you fooled around and sang a few songs. Helene showed you a picture from yesterday.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s like the one when he was younger,\u201d you said excitedly.</p><p>\u201cYes, he wanted it and we took it in the morning before you arrived,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh, I missed this moment\u201d you whined. Then Harry walked on stage behind all of you and called everyone for the end of the ping pong tournament. There was a little competition going on. You were in the top four with Harry, Kacey and a tech guy. And he planned the final games for today. Harry wore Kacey\u2019s merch and glasses. Harry didn\u2019t wear his glasses too often, but when he did, well, those days he felt really empowered. You played with him first and then with George, the tech guy and then with Kacey. It was hard to watch when Harry played with her. They spent a lot of time together recently and they had their own inner jokes. There was you, his girlfriend but you were restricted. You couldn\u2019t talk with him the way he could with Kacey. And he didn\u2019t even try hiding that he was in a great relationship with Kacey. Not a romantic one, but people assumed that she might be his girlfriend rather than you. Kacey lost and with that she was fourth. Then you played again. You were the next one to lose making you the third. Harry played the final with George. But Harry\u2019s a great player, he won the championship and the trophy. After congratulating Harry, you went to your dressing room to check the schedule.</p><p>Your dress was already there. You loved it, and Harry knew that. It was a long blue Calvin Klein dress that was long sleeved only on one side. You got some cool high heeled boots and as you put everything on, you felt so cool. You went to see Harry and met the band on the way. All of them complimented your dress and it made you feel more confident. When Helene finished photographing Harry and you, they left to go on stage. There were still a few minutes and you were supposed to be next to Harry.</p><p>\u201cJeff! Where\u2019s y/n?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. She said she doesn\u2019t feel good, but I don\u2019t know where she went\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cDamn\u201d he mumbled but went on stage. You were at the VIP section first, but you entered the standing area after the concert started. You wanted to be just one of them. A fan on her favorite singer\u2019s concert. Harry seemed to be really happy. Well, he was excited about the performance with Kacey. And also he won in table tennis. Some fans noticed you and smiled back at you. You loved being there. You managed to reach the security line. Matt stood there. You knew him. He immediately asked if you wanna go through the barrier. You shook your head.</p><p>You were nervous about the performance with Kacey. It felt wrong to you. By the middle of the concert, you watched it from a spot that was on the way they went on stage on. After a while, Kacey appeared next to you. She looked gorgeous. You were confident about your dress, but seeing her you felt you look like a potato. She smiled at you and you smiled back. And finally, Harry announced her and they started singing. By the time they were at the chorus, you were in tears. You felt you had to leave but stayed for Harry. You were proud of him after all. But you moved a bit further because you didn\u2019t want to run into Kacey when she left the stage. The concert went on and Harry enjoyed it very much.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"675\" data-orig-width=\"379\" style=\"\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/aeb0fda31193db20de3eb35245aa3ca7/tumblr_inline_pkry0dYnRT1vqssia_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"675\" data-orig-width=\"379\"></figure><figure data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"268\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/14d89165f1b2b34cd44c1780b0f63845/tumblr_inline_pkry0rQ1cD1vqssia_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"268\"></figure><figure data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"268\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2d562c18b9debb8edcafa4a92ff0379d/tumblr_inline_pkry0h1YMa1vqssia_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"268\"></figure><figure data-orig-height=\"348\" data-orig-width=\"268\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f0a15421ce17e474184d83c2288e4cbb/tumblr_inline_pkry0lws261vqssia_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"348\" data-orig-width=\"268\"></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"348\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"stylesinthewild:LOn-DkE_VAFK70lpIK4nFQ:Z-899i2aAcLRP\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/10bd9802671eacc092fdbcb7cd8792cf/tumblr_pcfocoARNh1v6scw1o1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"348\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"390\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"stylesinthewild:LOn-DkE_VAFK70lpIK4nFQ:Z-899i2ZZzOVw\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/093d1cd7cf262834b20ba79375f5d657/tumblr_pbgxoeKdmU1v6scw1o1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"390\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p>After the concert, you met Harry on the way to his dressing room.</p><p>\u201cYou did great today, I\u2019m proud of you!\u201d You hugged him.</p><p>\u201cFirst I thought you\u2019re not even there for me in that big moment\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I didn\u2019t miss it.\u201d Deep inside you wanted to love Harry, you couldn\u2019t just let him go.</p><p>Kacey appeared close so you released Harry.</p><p>\u201cYou were amazing Kacey!\u201d You smiled at her.</p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d She smiled back.</p><p>\u201cA question,\u201d Harry said. \u201c Why did you sing \u201cThey\u2019re still together\u201d?\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou two. I watched the two of you for a while. And you seemed pretty close so I talked to Sarah and Mitch. They didn\u2019t say anything. But their silence at the right places was enough to guess what\u2019s happening\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d That was surprising. You never thought that maybe Kacey is just a good friend. Maybe she wasn\u2019t the enemy after all?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t waste time! If you\u2019re happy together, let it be! Don\u2019t care about stupid bosses and other rumors.\u201d she winked and she was called from the other end of the aisle. You had to go back to your dressing room to pack your things. Harry went to his. While you were packing, Sarah came in.</p><p>\u201cCamille\u2019s here. Did you know that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat? No\u201d you frowned. It was a shock to you. You haven\u2019t seen her before the concert. Of course, it was a big venue and you weren\u2019t everywhere.</p><p>\u201cI saw her go into Harry\u2019s room,\u201d she said. \u201cJust wanted you to know\u201d she stood by the open door.</p><p>\u201cThanks!\u201d You said and she disappeared. When you finished, you walked to his room and opened it without knocking as you always did.</p><p>You were shocked at the sight. Camille cupped Harry\u2019s face and leaned closer as he smiled. They both looked at you suddenly. Your eyes went wide and your mouth was still open.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d you mumbled and ran out. Harry got out of the room and yelled your name. He was fit, he reached you.</p><p>\u201cY/N, it\u2019s not what it looked like,\u201d he said after stopping you and turning you to face him.</p><p>\u201cSod off\u201d you shrugged his hands off your shoulder and turned around to go away.</p><p>\u201cY/n, Please\" you turned back.</p><p>\u201cPlease what?\u201d You said and were so close you intimidated him. \u201cYou wanna tell it wasn\u2019t what I saw? Just because I haven\u2019t slept with you, you found someone else to ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t care about that. I love only you\u201d he cut you off and defended himself.</p><p>\u201cOr this is how you treat people with kindness? Hmm, Harry please kiss me, sure baby, I treat everyone with kindness. You were smiling while she leaned in!!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was trying to turn her back nicely\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave me alone\u201d you started crying and ran away. This time he let you.</p><p>\u201cHarry, what the hell? Come back!\u201d Camille cooed from behind him.</p><p>\u201cGet the hell out of here Cam!\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me? I just confessed that I loved you. I thought you feel the same\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t love you like that, Cam. You were on me. I didn\u2019t give any signs that it\u2019s mutual\" he said firmly.</p><p>\u201cYou just needed a push\u201d she put her hands on his chest, but he took them off immediately.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need anything from you,\u201d he said, walked past her and closed the door before she could get in. He packed everything and went to your dressing room. He knocked but there was no answer.</p><p>\u201cShe left already,\u201d Jeff said as he got there.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N left to the hotel, she seemed to be in a hurry. I hope she\u2019s okay\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDamn\u201d he went back to the hotel too. He knocked on your door. You sat on your bed crying your eyes out, listening to Sam Smith.</p><p>\u201cY/N, please, let me explain\u201d he shouted. You walked to the door and opened it, but sat back on the bed. You stayed silent.</p><p>\u201cI can explain. She came in out of nowhere. She said a lot of things and she admitted that she loves me and I was frozen because I didn\u2019t expect that from her. Then she cupped my face and tried to kiss me and I was about to remove her hands from me when you walked in\u201d he said. He seemed to be really sorry.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that? He asked.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I believe it\u201d you shrugged. Harry opened his mouth to speak, but you stopped him.</p><p>\u201cI need to think, Harry\u201d you looked down at your fingers that were tracing the hem of your shirt. \u201cThese things lately were too much for me. I love you, Harry, with all my heart, but these troubles recently sucked my energy. I need to think about this situation we\u2019re in\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cY/N, I love you,\u201d he said and tried to reach your hand but you pulled away. He looked down and you saw a tear fell on his knee.</p><p>\u201cI guess you don\u2019t want me to sleep here tonight\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, can you please leave?\u201d you asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah\u201d he whispered. He stood up.</p><p>\u201cWait, Harry!\u201d you said and he turned back immediately hoping that you changed your mind.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s yours\u201d you pointed at a little gift bag. He grabbed it.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurtle shaped bubble bath from Lush. I bought it for you a few days ago\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d He left. His heart was broken just like yours. You needed a hug though, but you couldn\u2019t just go to Harry, Louis wasn\u2019t in town. You stood up, grabbed your phone and left the room. You knocked. Sarah opened the door.</p><p>\u201cOh, girl! You look bad! \u201c She said.</p><p>\u201cThanks!\u201d she let you in. Mitch sat on the bed and probably they were watching a movie together.</p><p>\u201cSarah, do you mind if I cuddle your boyfriend? I really need a Mitch hug\u201d She chuckled.</p><p>\u201cNo, Harry does that without asking for permission,\u201d she said. You sat next to Mitch, Sarah on his other side and you hugged Mitch.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, girl? Haven\u2019t seen you this bad\u201d Mitch said as he wrapped his arm around you.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it,\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cI know you do. Maybe we don\u2019t know each other for years, but I know you enough to know, you\u2019re here to cuddle and talk\u201d he said. And really, after Harry, Mitch knew you most from the band and crew. You became friends just as fast as with Harry.</p><p>\u201cIs it Harry?\u201d he asked and you nodded, your face rubbing against his tee.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can be with him,\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cWait, are you dating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on! You already knew\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. Don\u2019t eat me\u201d he chuckled.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s getting too much. You know him, he\u2019s free, he does what he wants, and it\u2019s okay, but living in this secret relationship, girls hitting on him constantly. I don\u2019t take it well\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cDear, Harry loves you. He talks to me every day and he always tells me how much he loves you. He has bold moves. He is who he is. He\u2019ll always be a little extreme. But I know you love him too. I look at the two of you and I see two lovebirds being so happy to be together\u201d he said. You were in tears again.</p><p>\u201cGive him a chance. Harry never forgets the people he loves or loved. Those people have a special place in his heart. And I\u2019m sure your place in his heart is more special than mine or Anne\u2019s or anyone else\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mitch. I will think about him, but I\u2019m really mad at him right now\u201d you said as you wiped your tears away. You heard Sarah sniffling too.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Mitch said. You stayed there for a while, but then you went back to your room. You walked past Harry\u2019s room and you saw the light under the door. He was picking the guitar softly you could hear. You stood there for a while, thinking about going in. But you let him be instead and got back to your room.</p>",

Harry, I&rsquo;m&hellip; I&rsquo;m&hellip; I should be happy, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I thought it&rsquo;s gonna upset you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, but why? Part of me is proud of you. Singing that song in Madison Square Garden. That was your dream, Harry. I am proud of you. But I feel an ache in my heart. Because you know that I wanted to sing that with you. And it happened before that I sang with you on stage this tour. So, you can&rsquo;t say that you&rsquo;re singing with her just because you don&rsquo;t want to fuel rumors around us. And you were a lot with her recently. And my silly heart says that you might be more interested in her than in me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What? No. We were a lot together just to make this performance happen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know. But feelings are like a flower they grow if you water them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Look, if you want &nbsp;to be alone&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;d like to&rdquo; you sighed.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want to have dinner with me and the band?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure. Call me when you go.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks&rdquo; he was already by the door.</p><p>&ldquo;And y/n.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you.&rdquo; he left before you could say anything.</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t need things to be more messed up right now. In two days Harry will do two shows at Madison Square Garden, you have a lot of work to do, this is a huge thing. You didn&rsquo;t need this. You tried to cool down a bit before dinner. You took a hot bath with a relaxing bath bomb. It was a turtle-shaped bath bomb you bought in Lush. One for Harry and one for you. You listened to some relaxing music and let fresh air into the room. These things made you a little more relaxed. Harry rang you and you went down to the restaurant to have dinner. Clare, Adam, Sarah, and Mitch were already there and you arrived with Harry. It was all fun, but you knew Sarah noticed something&rsquo;s off.</p><p>Sarah: wanna talk about it after dinner?</p><p>You: we can. My room</p><p>You texted back under the table. When you all finished you went back to your room and Sarah followed you.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey! I noticed something&rsquo;s wrong. What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; she asked while she hopped on your bed.</p><p>&ldquo;You knew that Harry&rsquo;s gonna perform with Kacey?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I uhm.. I&rsquo;m the drummer&hellip;&rdquo; she said looking down like it was her fault too.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why but I feel so bad. I feel&hellip; that&hellip;. I don&rsquo;t know, I might be jealous. I thought Harry would sing that song with me and not her&rdquo; you burst out.</p><p>&ldquo;But wouldn&rsquo;t that make you more suspicious?&rdquo; she asked.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve sung together on stage on this tour before. I don&rsquo;t see why it would be a problem. And she&rsquo;s around Kacey a lot lately&rdquo; she hugged you. You felt tears on your cheeks. &ldquo;If I were around some guy, he&rsquo;d be following my every step and making sure that I don&rsquo;t spend extra time with anyone over the necessary. But if it&rsquo;s him it&rsquo;s nothing&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I understand you, dear. Tell him what you feel and maybe you can talk it through or solve it somehow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I guess I have to, but I&rsquo;ll leave it for when we finished in New York. These days are too busy. What could happen in two days?&rdquo;</p><p>Next day you had some work with the managers and you all met in the hotel&rsquo;s conference room while you knew Harry was out with Mitch in some music stores. The meeting was finished at 1 pm and you decided to have lunch with Jeff and the tour manager. Harry texted you that your date is tonight and you should wear something hot so you&rsquo;re going shopping as soon as you&rsquo;re ready. You totally forgot about the date, but you were happy you&rsquo;re going shopping because you had no idea what to wear. Harry guided you to denim and t-shirts which made you think that it&rsquo;s not gonna be a fancy restaurant date. In the end, you bought an oversize black Gucci tee, black skinny pants with the New York Yankees patch and a pink sequins bomber jacket. Back in the hotel, you matched it with your Gucci loafers and some cool earrings and rings. Harry was really satisfied with that and he chose casual Gucci to wear too. You left the hotel at about six and went by a tour car.</p><p>&ldquo;Uhm&hellip; we have to stop at MSG first&rdquo; Harry said.</p><p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there a concert tonight? Why do you have to go there?&rdquo; you asked but he stayed silent and you didn&rsquo;t want to ask again. Harry parked the car in the parking garage. When you got out of the car Harry stopped you.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey! This is my gift for you. I love you and I planned this for so long&rdquo; he smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; you asked looking around.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go through that door and you&rsquo;ll understand.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; He locked the car and took you by the hand. When he opened the door you didn&rsquo;t understand first. It was a back entrance and you saw people going around crazy. You saw a security guard that was going to stop you.</p><p>&ldquo;Sir, lady, can I see your admission cards?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh shoot! Yes of course!&rdquo; Harry said and took two neck straps with the cards on the ends.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; the man said. Harry hid the cards.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, would you tell me what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; you asked impatiently.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N!&rdquo; you heard someone yell from behind. You slowly turned around to see the body of the familiar voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Holy&hellip;!&rdquo; you cried out. Jared Leto was pacing through the crowd of people in your direction. You looked at Harry. He smirked.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, I couldn&rsquo;t wait to finally meet you!&rdquo; Jared said and kissed your cheeks and pulled you into a hug. He was tall, gorgeous and wearing some crazy Gucci clothes and gloves and sunglasses.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry!&rdquo; he shouted and hugged him too.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s get into my room,&rdquo; he said and you both followed him. As you all sat down in his room your mouth was still open from the shock.</p><p>&ldquo;So, Harry called me a month ago. He said he wants to surprise a special girl and that our concerts will be one night apart. I said that&rsquo;s crazy. If you bring your girlfriend here there&rsquo;s a high chance that I&rsquo;m gonna steal her. And now seeing you there&rsquo;s still a big chance.&rdquo; he smirked.</p><p>&ldquo;And I said everybody wants to steal my girl. Find another one cause she belongs to me&rdquo; Harry said.</p><p>&ldquo;He really did say that. I can see you both love Gucci&rdquo; Jared said.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, Harry made me. I&rsquo;ve never worn Gucci before I met him&rdquo; you smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;The three of us could be the next great Gucci models and it&rsquo;s not a complaint. I love Lana and Alessandro. By the way Harry, we missed you at the met gala&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wanted to give others a chance&rdquo; Harry smirked.</p><p>You all chatted for a bit more before a man came in asked Jared to get ready to go on stage. You and Harry took your places in the crowd but quite separated from the fans.</p><p>That night was amazing. The atmosphere was incredible and you could release a lot of stress by singing loud and jumping around. Jared winked at you several times during the concert. When it finished you went back to his room and took some cool pictures. You and Jared exchanged numbers and you saw Harry frowning. You were back in the car and you couldn&rsquo;t stop smiling.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry! Thank you so much for this!&rdquo; you looked at him still excited.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy if you&rsquo;re happy,&rdquo; he said softly and smiled.</p><p>When you got back to the hotel you ordered from room service and had dinner together. It was very late by that, so you were quick and both of you went to sleep asap.</p><p>Next day you remembered last night and smiled as you woke up. You uploaded two pictures on your Instagram and went down to have breakfast. Jeff was there with Glenn and Mitch with Sarah. You went to sit with them.</p><p>&ldquo;Good morning!&rdquo; They said and you greeted them too.</p><p>&ldquo;I saw you had fun last night,&rdquo; Sarah said.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; you smiled crazily.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry&rsquo;s already at MSG,&rdquo; Jeff said.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay. Shall we go together?&rdquo; you asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure. I&rsquo;ll leave at 11.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;ll be ready.&rdquo; When you finished breakfast you went back to your room to pack a few things for the day. You went down to the car in time and you left with Jeff, Mitch, and Sarah. When you arrived you were surprised that the traces of the last night were cleared. All of Harry&rsquo;s and MSG&rsquo;s crew were around making the place suitable for the concert. When you first saw Harry that day he was playing ping pong with Kacey and some others. You stopped to play with them since you had some time until your room was ready. A little later you were called to go to a meeting. The day went by and eventually, you ran into Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey! We haven&rsquo;t talked all day&rdquo; he said as he stepped into your room where you were filling papers.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey&rdquo; you looked up &ldquo;yeah, I was kinda busy&rdquo; you pointed at the stack of papers.</p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; And here you were feeling like you two were distancing again, despite the amazing date you two had yesterday.</p><p>&ldquo;I &hellip;uh, I don&rsquo;t want to distract you from work, so I uh&hellip; I&rsquo;ll go find Mitch&rdquo; he stuttered.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, I uh&hellip; I&rsquo;ll be here&rdquo; you smiled. It was awkward. He was your boyfriend and you simply let him go. No kiss, no hug. And you didn&rsquo;t even feel guilty. But then you remembered. &ldquo;Damn&rdquo; you mumbled to yourself and immediately went after Harry. You found him in his dressing room alone, crying. You ran to him in an instant and hugged him so tightly. No words were needed. He knew you knew. After that, you both sat down in a cuddle and haven&rsquo;t said a word for minutes.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m such an idiot. I forgot&rdquo; you said.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. You haven&rsquo;t even known me a year ago.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love your suit. It&rsquo;s beautiful&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I sent a picture of it and sent it to mum then I called her. She was crying&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is it better if you talk about it or not?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I happily talk about how great he was. I loved him as my own father.&rdquo; he smiled. &ldquo;He would&rsquo;ve loved you&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I forgot,&rdquo; you said.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. Let&rsquo;s get dressed for tonight&rdquo; he smiled back at you. You went back to your room and quickly finished with the papers. You put on the beautiful clothes that were hanged in your room already. You went back to Harry&rsquo;s room and he was all dressed up in that beautiful white patterned suit. He looked like a dream.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready if you&rsquo;re ready,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. Let&rsquo;s go&rdquo; you went to find Helene to take pictures of you two and some of Harry as he was preparing for the concert. Then it was time to go on stage. Harry was nervous, it was a &nbsp;big thing for him. You were nervous too, for him. You had to go backstage for a while, but you saw most of the concert. Harry was emotional and thankful and a dork as always. It was one of the best of his shows that you&rsquo;ve seen.</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"1\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c9432fda1d49bda192a0c05c8b9ad594/tumblr_inline_pkry0iHq781vqssia_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8d1224343fdb6fdeff36f8d561181045/tumblr_inline_pkry0uKABV1vqssia_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ffef97deab426415b767035a2ae0f33a/tumblr_inline_pkry0pjVuq1vqssia_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>When the night was over everyone was quick because the next day you had to do it again. Everyone quickly went to sleep and you couldn&rsquo;t wait for this to be over, because you wanted to rest and talk with Harry.</p><p>Next day you all went to MSG by the morning. When Harry finally found you sitting alone on the stage, after you were hiding from him, there was no chance to run away.</p><p>&ldquo;Love, what&rsquo;s up? You lost in thoughts?&rdquo; He asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah! I&hellip; I was just thinking&rdquo; you replied.</p><p>&ldquo;About what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;About your performance tonight with Kacey. You know that I love this song. And I would sing it with you. But of course, I know I can&rsquo;t. She&rsquo;s the singer.

Tell me what you think&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s just so much better than me. Fans gonna love the rumors that you two are together. I can see the headlines now. And I&rsquo;ll just stay in the background, living in a lie&rdquo; it came out of your mouth.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/n, I love you,&rdquo; he said and stepped closer.</p><p>&ldquo;I know, Harry. I love you too&rdquo; you said as a tear rolled down your cheek. &ldquo;I just wanted to live the moment with you&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know, but Kacey is my pre-show performer. It&rsquo;s expected to perform with her&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nevermind&rdquo; you wiped the tears away. You were a bit angry now. Harry wanted to kiss you, but Kacey came from behind. She smiled so brightly. You tried to smile back.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re waiting for you, Harry,&rdquo; she said. They left together.</p><p>You stayed on stage and Sarah, Clare and Helene arrived. You had fun with the girls as you fooled around and sang a few songs. Helene showed you a picture from yesterday.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s like the one when he was younger,&rdquo; you said excitedly.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, he wanted it and we took it in the morning before you arrived,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I missed this moment&rdquo; you whined. Then Harry walked on stage behind all of you and called everyone for the end of the ping pong tournament. There was a little competition going on. You were in the top four with Harry, Kacey and a tech guy. And he planned the final games for today. Harry wore Kacey&rsquo;s merch and glasses. Harry didn&rsquo;t wear his glasses too often, but when he did, well, those days he felt really empowered. You played with him first and then with George, the tech guy and then with Kacey. It was hard to watch when Harry played with her. They spent a lot of time together recently and they had their own inner jokes. There was you, his girlfriend but you were restricted. You couldn&rsquo;t talk with him the way he could with Kacey. And he didn&rsquo;t even try hiding that he was in a great relationship with Kacey. Not a romantic one, but people assumed that she might be his girlfriend rather than you. Kacey lost and with that she was fourth. Then you played again. You were the next one to lose making you the third. Harry played the final with George. But Harry&rsquo;s a great player, he won the championship and the trophy. After congratulating Harry, you went to your dressing room to check the schedule.</p><p>Your dress was already there. You loved it, and Harry knew that. It was a long blue Calvin Klein dress that was long sleeved only on one side. You got some cool high heeled boots and as you put everything on, you felt so cool. You went to see Harry and met the band on the way. All of them complimented your dress and it made you feel more confident. When Helene finished photographing Harry and you, they left to go on stage. There were still a few minutes and you were supposed to be next to Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;Jeff! Where&rsquo;s y/n?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. She said she doesn&rsquo;t feel good, but I don&rsquo;t know where she went&rdquo; he replied.</p><p>&ldquo;Damn&rdquo; he mumbled but went on stage. You were at the VIP section first, but you entered the standing area after the concert started. You wanted to be just one of them. A fan on her favorite singer&rsquo;s concert. Harry seemed to be really happy. Well, he was excited about the performance with Kacey. And also he won in table tennis. Some fans noticed you and smiled back at you. You loved being there. You managed to reach the security line. Matt stood there. You knew him. He immediately asked if you wanna go through the barrier. You shook your head.</p><p>You were nervous about the performance with Kacey. It felt wrong to you. By the middle of the concert, you watched it from a spot that was on the way they went on stage on. After a while, Kacey appeared next to you. She looked gorgeous. You were confident about your dress, but seeing her you felt you look like a potato. She smiled at you and you smiled back. And finally, Harry announced her and they started singing. By the time they were at the chorus, you were in tears. You felt you had to leave but stayed for Harry. You were proud of him after all. But you moved a bit further because you didn&rsquo;t want to run into Kacey when she left the stage. The concert went on and Harry enjoyed it very much.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/aeb0fda31193db20de3eb35245aa3ca7/tumblr_inline_pkry0dYnRT1vqssia_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/14d89165f1b2b34cd44c1780b0f63845/tumblr_inline_pkry0rQ1cD1vqssia_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2d562c18b9debb8edcafa4a92ff0379d/tumblr_inline_pkry0h1YMa1vqssia_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f0a15421ce17e474184d83c2288e4cbb/tumblr_inline_pkry0lws261vqssia_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"2\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"3\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>After the concert, you met Harry on the way to his dressing room.</p><p>&ldquo;You did great today, I&rsquo;m proud of you!&rdquo; You hugged him.</p><p>&ldquo;First I thought you&rsquo;re not even there for me in that big moment&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course I didn&rsquo;t miss it.&rdquo; Deep inside you wanted to love Harry, you couldn&rsquo;t just let him go.</p><p>Kacey appeared close so you released Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;You were amazing Kacey!&rdquo; You smiled at her.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; She smiled back.</p><p>&ldquo;A question,&rdquo; Harry said. &ldquo; Why did you sing &ldquo;They&rsquo;re still together&rdquo;?&rdquo; She smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;You two. I watched the two of you for a while. And you seemed pretty close so I talked to Sarah and Mitch. They didn&rsquo;t say anything. But their silence at the right places was enough to guess what&rsquo;s happening&rdquo; she said.</p><p>&ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; That was surprising. You never thought that maybe Kacey is just a good friend. Maybe she wasn&rsquo;t the enemy after all?</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t waste time! If you&rsquo;re happy together, let it be! Don&rsquo;t care about stupid bosses and other rumors.&rdquo; she winked and she was called from the other end of the aisle. You had to go back to your dressing room to pack your things. Harry went to his. While you were packing, Sarah came in.</p><p>&ldquo;Camille&rsquo;s here. Did you know that?&rdquo; she asked.</p><p>&ldquo;What? No&rdquo; you frowned. It was a shock to you. You haven&rsquo;t seen her before the concert. Of course, it was a big venue and you weren&rsquo;t everywhere.</p><p>&ldquo;I saw her go into Harry&rsquo;s room,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Just wanted you to know&rdquo; she stood by the open door.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks!&rdquo; You said and she disappeared. When you finished, you walked to his room and opened it without knocking as you always did.</p><p>You were shocked at the sight. Camille cupped Harry&rsquo;s face and leaned closer as he smiled. They both looked at you suddenly. Your eyes went wide and your mouth was still open.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&rdquo; you mumbled and ran out. Harry got out of the room and yelled your name. He was fit, he reached you.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, it&rsquo;s not what it looked like,&rdquo; he said after stopping you and turning you to face him.</p><p>&ldquo;Sod off&rdquo; you shrugged his hands off your shoulder and turned around to go away.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/n, Please\" you turned back.</p><p>&ldquo;Please what?&rdquo; You said and were so close you intimidated him. &ldquo;You wanna tell it wasn&rsquo;t what I saw? Just because I haven&rsquo;t slept with you, you found someone else to ?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. I don&rsquo;t care about that. I love only you&rdquo; he cut you off and defended himself.</p><p>&ldquo;Or this is how you treat people with kindness? Hmm, Harry please kiss me, sure baby, I treat everyone with kindness. You were smiling while she leaned in!!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was trying to turn her back nicely&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Leave me alone&rdquo; you started crying and ran away. This time he let you.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, what the hell? Come back!&rdquo; Camille cooed from behind him.</p><p>&ldquo;Get the hell out of here Cam!&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me? I just confessed that I loved you. I thought you feel the same&rdquo; she said.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t love you like that, Cam. You were on me. I didn&rsquo;t give any signs that it&rsquo;s mutual\" he said firmly.</p><p>&ldquo;You just needed a push&rdquo; she put her hands on his chest, but he took them off immediately.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need anything from you,&rdquo; he said, walked past her and closed the door before she could get in. He packed everything and went to your dressing room. He knocked but there was no answer.</p><p>&ldquo;She left already,&rdquo; Jeff said as he got there.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N left to the hotel, she seemed to be in a hurry. I hope she&rsquo;s okay&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;Damn&rdquo; he went back to the hotel too. He knocked on your door. You sat on your bed crying your eyes out, listening to Sam Smith.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, please, let me explain&rdquo; he shouted. You walked to the door and opened it, but sat back on the bed. You stayed silent.</p><p>&ldquo;I can explain. She came in out of nowhere. She said a lot of things and she admitted that she loves me and I was frozen because I didn&rsquo;t expect that from her. Then she cupped my face and tried to kiss me and I was about to remove her hands from me when you walked in&rdquo; he said. He seemed to be really sorry.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; you said.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that? He asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, I believe it&rdquo; you shrugged. Harry opened his mouth to speak, but you stopped him.</p><p>&ldquo;I need to think, Harry&rdquo; you looked down at your fingers that were tracing the hem of your shirt. &ldquo;These things lately were too much for me. I love you, Harry, with all my heart, but these troubles recently sucked my energy. I need to think about this situation we&rsquo;re in&rdquo; you said.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, I love you,&rdquo; he said and tried to reach your hand but you pulled away. He looked down and you saw a tear fell on his knee.</p><p>&ldquo;I guess you don&rsquo;t want me to sleep here tonight&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, can you please leave?&rdquo; you asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&rdquo; he whispered. He stood up.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, Harry!&rdquo; you said and he turned back immediately hoping that you changed your mind.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s yours&rdquo; you pointed at a little gift bag. He grabbed it.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Turtle shaped bubble bath from Lush. I bought it for you a few days ago&rdquo; you said.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; He left. His heart was broken just like yours. You needed a hug though, but you couldn&rsquo;t just go to Harry, Louis wasn&rsquo;t in town. You stood up, grabbed your phone and left the room. You knocked. Sarah opened the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, girl! You look bad! &ldquo; She said.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks!&rdquo; she let you in. Mitch sat on the bed and probably they were watching a movie together.</p><p>&ldquo;Sarah, do you mind if I cuddle your boyfriend? I really need a Mitch hug&rdquo; She chuckled.</p><p>&ldquo;No, Harry does that without asking for permission,&rdquo; she said. You sat next to Mitch, Sarah on his other side and you hugged Mitch.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, girl? Haven&rsquo;t seen you this bad&rdquo; Mitch said as he wrapped his arm around you.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to talk about it,&rdquo; you said.</p><p>&ldquo;I know you do. Maybe we don&rsquo;t know each other for years, but I know you enough to know, you&rsquo;re here to cuddle and talk&rdquo; he said. And really, after Harry, Mitch knew you most from the band and crew. You became friends just as fast as with Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;Is it Harry?&rdquo; he asked and you nodded, your face rubbing against his tee.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if I can be with him,&rdquo; you said.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, are you dating?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, come on! You already knew&rdquo; you said.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, okay. Don&rsquo;t eat me&rdquo; he chuckled.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting too much. You know him, he&rsquo;s free, he does what he wants, and it&rsquo;s okay, but living in this secret relationship, girls hitting on him constantly. I don&rsquo;t take it well&rdquo; you said.</p><p>&ldquo;Dear, Harry loves you. He talks to me every day and he always tells me how much he loves you. He has bold moves. He is who he is. He&rsquo;ll always be a little extreme. But I know you love him too. I look at the two of you and I see two lovebirds being so happy to be together&rdquo; he said. You were in tears again.</p><p>&ldquo;Give him a chance. Harry never forgets the people he loves or loved. Those people have a special place in his heart. And I&rsquo;m sure your place in his heart is more special than mine or Anne&rsquo;s or anyone else&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mitch. I will think about him, but I&rsquo;m really mad at him right now&rdquo; you said as you wiped your tears away. You heard Sarah sniffling too.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Mitch said. You stayed there for a while, but then you went back to your room. You walked past Harry&rsquo;s room and you saw the light under the door. He was picking the guitar softly you could hear. You stood there for a while, thinking about going in. But you let him be instead and got back to your room.</p>",
