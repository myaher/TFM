I\u2019m super psyched for you all to get to read it finally. Of course, a big shout out to my beta, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/miuLNVi__fTryIM2CU8h-ew\">@fourthingsandawizard</a> because this fic wouldn\u2019t be nearly as good as it is without her input. This is based of of amazing artwork by <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m13JnekLdzIssW8vy3ZRjFw\">@lovelydeps</a> which you can find <a href=\"https://lovelydeps.tumblr.com/post/182423163158/here-are-my-drawings-for-the-phandomreversebang\">here</a>. You should definitely go give both of them some love! Now, without further ado, Airport Coffee.\u00a0</p><hr><p>Pairing: Phan, obviously.\u00a0</p><p>Summary:\u00a0Complete strangers Dan and Phil get stranded in an airport together overnight. Lots of gay, caffeinated antics ensue.</p><p>Warnings: None, let me know if I missed something but it\u2019s just pretty fluffy.\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17635916/chapters/41584631\">Read it on AO3\u00a0</a>\u00a0</p><p>Dan reached into his pocket in response to the small buzz that had come from his phone to see a text from his roommate, Josh. \u201cETA?\u201d it read. He typed out a quick response promising to check, then headed over to the flight information board to check his plane\u2019s estimated arrival.</p><p>He arrived at the screens at the same time as another man around his age, who Dan immediately noticed was, well, incredibly handsome. Just as he tried to find his flight number, all of the boards flashed with the message \u201cFLIGHT BA2491A TO LONDON - CANCELLED.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck. Fuck fuck fuck.\u201d</p><p>Dan didn\u2019t mean to swear as loudly as he did, and blushed when the raven-haired man next to him chuckled. Since when did Dan start referring to people as \u201craven-haired?\u201d What was he talking about?</p><!-- more --><p>He was jolted from his thoughts by someone asking, \u201cLondon?\u201d He didn\u2019t realize they were talking to him, but glanced over to see the man looking at him.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dan muttered. He was not a fan of talking to random strangers in airports, even incredibly handsome ones. God, what\u2019s gotten into me? He wasn\u2019t normally like this. Especially not to strangers. At the very least, he could normally get through one sentence without thinking of someone as \u201craven-haired\u201d and \u201cincredibly handsome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too. Although, I guess this isn\u2019t the worst airport to get stuck in\u2026 I\u2019m Phil, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan. Nice to meet you. Uh, what brings you to Isle of Man?\u201d Dan supposed that if he was going to be stuck here, he might as well talk to someone.</p><p>\u201cFamily. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust visiting some old friends for a few days.\u201d Phil\u2019s response had been so blunt, Dan kept his pretty short as well. Maybe he was annoying Phil and should just shut up. Or maybe he was just overthinking things. Fuck.</p><p>Dan\u2019s phone buzzed against his leg again, reminding him of why he was checking the flights in the first place.</p><p>\u201cCrap, that\u2019ll be my roommate. I gotta reply to this, sorry,\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ok. I should go try to figure out a flight. See you around, Dan,\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye.\u201d</p><p>Dan assumed that would be the last of their interaction. Even though they both lived in London, apparently, it didn\u2019t mean they\u2019d see each other around, the way Phil had suggested. London was a pretty big city, after all. He couldn\u2019t help but hope, just a little bit, but instead of dwelling on that, Dan opened up his phone to check his text from Josh.</p><p>Josh: dude it cant be taking that long to check how long your flights gonna be<br/>Dan: fuck sorry. <br/>Dan: it got cancelled<br/>Dan: have to wait till morning. maybe longer<br/>Josh: damn. gettin kinda boring around here w/out you<br/>Dan: sorry. be home asap<br/>Josh: k</p><p>Dan considered telling Josh about Phil, but decided against it last minute. He really didn\u2019t want to be getting a crush on some random guy from the airport based solely on the two sentences they\u2019d exchanged, and telling Josh would only solidify his feelings. Hell, he barely even knew anything about this guy. All he knew is that he lived in London and had family on Isle of Man.</p><p>He headed to the desk to inquire about his flight, only to discover that all flights to London had been cancelled until the next morning due to bad weather. He gave Josh the heads-up that he would be stuck overnight, then decided to head to the nearest place selling food. That place just so happened to be a Burger King, and Dan just so happened to run into Phil while in said Burger King. Quite literally run into him.</p><p>He was looking down at his phone, texting with Josh, when he slammed into someone.</p><p>\u201cFuck. Sorry.\u201d He looked up only to see that that someone was Phil. \u201cFuck,\u201d he said again.</p><p>\u201cHey, Dan,\u201d Phil said, laughing. \u201cTold you I\u2019d see you around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry.\u201d Dan couldn\u2019t help but chuckle a little bit, too; Phil\u2019s smile really was contagious.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright. You might wanna watch where you\u2019re going, though; next time it might not be someone as good natured as me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Dan muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you getting?\u201d Phil asked, changing the subject.</p><p>\u201cUh..\u201d Dan hadn\u2019t actually had a chance to check the menu yet, and he didn\u2019t usually end up in Burger Kings in airports talking to strangers about menu items. Are we still strangers? Probably. \u201cProbably a cheeseburger, those are good, I guess. I don\u2019t normally eat at Burger King.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe neither. I have no idea what to get. Maybe I\u2019ll just copy you and get a cheeseburger, but without the cheese.\u201d</p><p>Dan couldn\u2019t help the incredulousness in his voice. \u201cA cheeseburger without the cheese? Isn\u2019t that just a plain burger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Right. Probably.\u201d Phil giggled. It was rare that Dan had an excuse to use the word \u201cgiggled,\u201d but whatever noise just came out of Phil\u2019s mouth definitely qualified as a giggle. Dan almost rolled his eyes at himself for all the words he was using to describe Phil in his head, but narrowly avoided it, thank god. It really would have looked like he was rolling his eyes at Phil, and that would have made him look like a total dick.</p><p>They ended up eating their burgers together at an uncomfortable plastic table. The chairs made Dan feel like he was in primary school again. They chatted a little bit about their families and their roommates, and Dan learned that the two of them had a lot in common - they both had brothers, they both got along quite well with their roommates, and they both liked to play Mario Kart. They also realized they only lived a few blocks away from each other in London, and even frequently inhabited the same Starbucks.</p><p>\u201cHow have we not met each other before? It doesn\u2019t make any sense. We\u2019re practically the same person,\u201d Dan said. \u201cHell, we even go to the same Starbucks! Do you know how often I\u2019m in Starbucks?\u201d Dan was genuinely confused about how he didn\u2019t already know this guy.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we\u2019ve seen each other before and just didn\u2019t notice? I mean, there are a lot of people in that Starbucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Dan was pretty sure he\u2019d have noticed if he had seen Phil before, though. For one, he was almost as tall as Dan, and that was pretty damn tall. He was also, as Dan couldn\u2019t stop thinking about, incredibly handsome, and had a pretty big personality - he was wearing a bright red sweater with ladybug spots all over it, and Dan got the feeling wearing something as brightly colored as that wasn\u2019t unusual for him. It suited him, though. It brings out the bright blue of his eyes. There he went again. Thinking about Phil\u2019s appearance while he was supposed to be having a conversation.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of Starbucks - I could really use some coffee. Do you know if there&rsquo;s one around here?\u201d Dan really was starting to get tired. It was already 9pm, but he might as well get caffeinated if he was gonna be stuck at the airport until the next day.</p><p>\u201cThere must be,\u201d Phil replied, tapping his chin in thought. \u201cHey! I know! We can try all the holiday drinks!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what, why not? It\u2019s not like we\u2019re in a hurry.\u201d</p><p>They got up and threw out their trash, then headed into the long, plain airport hallway to try and find a Starbucks. They walked past plenty of little shops, selling things like magazines, candy, and makeup. Why anyone would want to buy makeup from an airport stand, Dan had no idea. He also learned that Phil had a bit of a sweet tooth, as he insisted they stop and get candy along the way. Dan expected him to just get something little, like a bag of M&amp;Ms, but instead he came out of the shop with an entire plastic bag of all sorts of candy.</p><p>\u201cThat is so much candy, Phil. Are you really going to eat all of that?\u201d Shit. Dan realized too late how judgemental that might have sounded, but luckily Phil didn\u2019t seem to take it that way.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t decide, so I got one of everything,\u201d Phil said, giggling again. God, that giggle had to be one of the cutest things Dan had ever heard. \u201cBesides, there\u2019s two of us, and we\u2019ve got all night. We might as well stock up on some snacks.\u201d</p><p>At that, Dan blushed a little bit. Did Phil really plan on spending all night with him? Dan wasn\u2019t complaining, of course, but he also wasn\u2019t expecting that.</p><p>\u201cWell, alright, then,\u201d Dan agreed after regaining his composure. This one guy who he barely knew shouldn\u2019t be ruffling his feathers this much. \u201cThat\u2019s still a shit tonne of candy, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s not just candy. There\u2019s popcorn and marshmallows, too!\u201d Phil had already started walking, and Dan had to jog a little to catch up.</p><p>\u201cMarshmallows?\u201d Dan asked, incredulous.</p><p>\u201cYeah! We can add them to coffee. They taste pretty good on their own, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd popcorn? Is there even a microwave around here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure we can find one. We can do anything we set our hearts to, Dan!\u201d Phil was so enthusiastic, Dan couldn\u2019t help but feel like they really could do anything.</p><p>\u201cSo, we can just make a microwave materialize if we can\u2019t find one?\u201d Dan might have felt inspired by Phil\u2019s little speech, but he couldn\u2019t help teasing him a little bit. Phil never responded, though, because he saw the Starbucks at the end of the hall and began to, well, skip towards it, dragging his suitcase and bag of candy behind him. Dan jogged a bit to catch up, and by the time he got there, Phil was waiting in line, out of breath.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you run? It\u2019s not like we\u2019re in a hurry,\u201d Dan said in between gasps for breath. He really hated running. A lot.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Phil was panting, too, but he wasn\u2019t as out of breath as Dan. \u201cI got excited, I guess. I really don\u2019t like to run, though, I don\u2019t know what I was thinking.\u201d Dan laughed and agreed. The line was moving fast, though, and by the time they had both caught their breath, they were at the front of the line.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I get you guys?\u201d The woman working the counter looked exhausted, and spoke in a completely monotone voice with no emotion on her face. Dan forgave her for her sullenness, though, because it was almost 10pm and she must have dealt with a crap tonne of grumpy airport goers today.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take one of all of your holiday specials, please.\u201d At Phil\u2019s request, the cashier definitely showed some emotion - pure confusion.</p><p>\u201cAll of them? You know there\u2019s more than 20, right?\u201d</p><p>Seeing Phil was about to nod his head, Dan cut in.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you pick five of your favorites?\u201d he suggested to the woman. And then to Phil, he said, \u201cWe really won\u2019t be able to get through 20 cups of coffee. Even if we\u2019ve got all night.\u201d</p><p>Phil still looked a little disappointed, but agreed in the end. Dan knew they\u2019d be better off without 20 cups of coffee to get through.</p><p>When the coffee was finally done, Dan steered them to the booths in one of the terminals. It was still pretty uncomfortable, but less so then the plastic tables they\u2019d eaten their burgers at. After trying - and finishing - all of the coffee, both Dan and Phil were very hyper. Dan solved this problem by fidgeting and bouncing his knee, but Phil, being much less shy, quite literally got up and began skipping around the mostly empty terminal.</p><p>Phil hopped back to Dan and did a little twirl in front of him, then started dancing to whatever shitty music airports played at 11pm. Dan realized that, with every stupid thing Phil did, Dan\u2019s crush only grew. He laughed and pulled out his phone camera to record Phil. He wanted to remember this night forever, even if he never saw Phil again. He really didn\u2019t like the idea of that, though. He decided that he would see this dork again, even if he didn\u2019t quite know how or when that would happen.</p><p>After he recorded for a couple minutes, Phil came over and sat down next to him, a little out of breath. Phil pulled his phone out of his pocket and then sat it down again.</p><p>\u201cShit. My phone\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, you swore! I think I\u2019m a bad influence on you.\u201d</p><p>Phil giggled again. \u201cNah. I swear a lot. But I lose my filter more when I\u2019m this caffeinated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, do you have a charger?\u201d Dan asked.</p><p>Phil reached into his smaller carry-on bag and fished around for a while.</p><p>\u201cCrap. I think it\u2019s in my suitcase or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, let&rsquo;s find it then.\u201d Dan had already flipped Phil\u2019s suitcase unto its back and started unzipping it. When he flipped the top open, he discovered that his earlier assumption that Phil wore bright clothes all the time was confirmed. Everything in his suitcase was blindingly bright.</p><p>After digging though his suitcase together for a while, Dan finally felt his hand hit something metal. He pulled the cord out victoriously.</p><p>\u201cHa! Found the bastard.\u201d</p><p>Phil cheered.</p><p>\u201cWait, where\u2019s the adaptor cube?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrap. Uhh.. I don\u2019t see one. Did you feel anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might have left it at my parent\u2019s house. I can text my brother, I think he\u2019s still there. Wait, never mind, my phone\u2019s dead. Can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid the place we got the candy from have chargers? We could buy a cube there,\u201d Dan suggested.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think so. Field trip!\u201d Phil hopped up from his seat on the floor, then promptly sat down again. \u201cWait, do you know where it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on. Their website has a map I can pull up\u2026 This says it\u2019s a five minute walk from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gay and caffeinated, it\u2019ll only take three. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Oh. Phil was gay. It hadn\u2019t even occurred to Dan that he wouldn\u2019t be. Of course he shouldn&rsquo;t have assumed, but it was ok that he had because Phil was. Thank god, Phil was gay.</p><p>Dan must have froze up because Phil turned to look at him funny.</p><p>\u201cEverything ok?\u201d Dan could almost watch Phil close off a little. \u201cUnless there\u2019s something wrong with me being gay&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo no no, of course not. Me too. I mean, I\u2019m gay, too. Well, not gay. Bi. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being gay. Sorry.\u201d Dan tripped over his words so many times, he wasn\u2019t sure if Phil knew what he meant, but he seemed to understand because Phil began to look relieved.</p><p>\u201cOk. Good. Me too. Bi, I mean. I\u2019m bi too.\u201d Dan laughed at their awkwardness, and Phil joined in. Dan stood up off the floor, and extended a hand to Phil.</p><p>\u201cShall we go get your phone charger, then?\u201d</p><p>Phil grasped his hand, and Dan blushed a little at the sudden contact.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Dan expected Phil to let go of his hand once he stood up, but he didn\u2019t, grabbing his suitcase in his other hand and pulling Dan in the direction of the shop.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Dan laughed. \u201cI gotta grab my suitcase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOops.\u201d Phil looked sheepish, and dropped Dan\u2019s hand, blushing. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>Dan, also blushing, just grabbed Phil\u2019s hand back in response.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ok. That is, if it\u2019s ok with you?\u201d</p><p>Phil just squeezed his hand a little and set off once again.</p><p>Still holding hands, they soon arrived at the shop. It really did only take them about three minutes, but Dan wasn\u2019t sure whether that was because they were \u201cgay and caffeinated,\u201d as Phil had said, or just because the airport was so empty. There really are surprisingly few people here. Maybe everyone went to hotels. That would have been a good idea. Oh. No. It wouldn&rsquo;t have. I wouldn\u2019t get this night with Phil.</p><p>After they grabbed a cube, Phil suggested they go find the terminal back for the flight back to London so they could be ready when the time came. After wandering the airport for another 10 minutes, they finally found a packed terminal full of all the Londoners. That must be where all the people went. They just came here instead of wandering the airport.</p><p>Phil spotted a charging port across the room and pulled Dan in that direction. They finally wove their way over there - it would have been a lot easier to let go of each other, but neither of them seemed willing to do so.</p><p>\u201cCrap. All the spots are taken. Do you see another one?\u201d Phil asked. He was still holding his giant bag of candy, which he waved in the air. \u201cWe can eat all this as soon as we get my phone plugged in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you wanna go over to another empty terminal? I think the one we were in before had a plug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk!\u201d Phil still seemed cheerful from the coffee, but Dan felt like he was starting to crash a little and really just wanted to sit down.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one right over there.\u201d He raised the hand that was holding Phil\u2019s to point them in the right direction. Holding Phil\u2019s hand. He was holding Phil\u2019s hand! Even in his mildly delirious and exhausted state, he couldn\u2019t help but smile.</p><p>With every passing second, Dan was getting more and more tired. As the effects of caffeine wore off, his body seemed to start to remember that it was nearly 2am. After Phil plugged in his phone, Dan pulled a charger out of his bag and plugged his in, too, not thinking anything of it.</p><p>\u201cWait! You had a charger this whole time?\u201d Phil seemed very awake still.</p><p>\u201cShit. I did.\u201d Dan started laughing, and Phil did, too. They eventually collapsed on one of the benches together, and Dan rested his head on Phil\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sleepy,\u201d Dan mumbled into Phil\u2019s shoulder, probably barely audible.</p><p>\u201cGo to sleep then, Dan,\u201d Phil whispered back.</p><p>\u201cMkay.\u201d Dan curled up on the bench, his head in Phil\u2019s lap, and almost instantly fell asleep.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>Dan awoke what must have been a few hours later with Phil shaking his shoulder gently.</p><p>\u201cDan\u2026 Wake up. I gotta go, they just called my flight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, you\u2019re leaving?\u201d Dan was suddenly very awake and sat up straight. Not yet! Phil can&rsquo;t be leaving! He felt he could spend forever with Phil, and they only had a couple minutes left, maybe less.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019ll miss you, Dan.\u201d Phil started to stand up, but Dan grabbed his hand.</p><p>\u201cWait. Gimme your phone.\u201d Phil unlocked his phone and handed it to Dan, who quickly added himself to Phil\u2019s contacts. \u201cCall me. I wanna see you again. I really like you, Phil.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t normally this blunt, but he was tired, and this was his last chance to persuade Phil to see him again.</p><p>\u201cI really like you, too, Dan.\u201d Phil\u2019s voice was softer than Dan had ever heard it. \u201cI\u2019ll call, I promise.\u201d</p><p>Phil leaned forward and kissed Dan on the cheek. \u201cSee you around, Dan.\u201d</p><p>And with that, Phil walked away, leaving Dan flustered and blushing, standing in the middle of an airport terminal.</p>",

He typed out a quick response promising to check, then headed over to the flight information board to check his plane\u2019s estimated arrival.</p><p>He arrived at the screens at the same time as another man around his age, who Dan immediately noticed was, well, incredibly handsome. Just as he tried to find his flight number, all of the boards flashed with the message \u201cFLIGHT BA2491A TO LONDON - CANCELLED.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck. Fuck fuck fuck.\u201d</p><p>Dan didn\u2019t mean to swear as loudly as he did, and blushed when the raven-haired man next to him chuckled. Since when did Dan start referring to people as \u201craven-haired?\u201d What was he talking about?</p>[[MORE]]<p>He was jolted from his thoughts by someone asking, \u201cLondon?\u201d He didn\u2019t realize they were talking to him, but glanced over to see the man looking at him.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dan muttered. He was not a fan of talking to random strangers in airports, even incredibly handsome ones. God, what\u2019s gotten into me? He wasn\u2019t normally like this. Especially not to strangers. At the very least, he could normally get through one sentence without thinking of someone as \u201craven-haired\u201d and \u201cincredibly handsome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too. Although, I guess this isn\u2019t the worst airport to get stuck in\u2026 I\u2019m Phil, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan. Nice to meet you. Uh, what brings you to Isle of Man?\u201d Dan supposed that if he was going to be stuck here, he might as well talk to someone.</p><p>\u201cFamily. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust visiting some old friends for a few days.\u201d Phil\u2019s response had been so blunt, Dan kept his pretty short as well. Maybe he was annoying Phil and should just shut up. Or maybe he was just overthinking things. Fuck.</p><p>Dan\u2019s phone buzzed against his leg again, reminding him of why he was checking the flights in the first place.</p><p>\u201cCrap, that\u2019ll be my roommate. I gotta reply to this, sorry,\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ok. I should go try to figure out a flight. See you around, Dan,\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye.\u201d</p><p>Dan assumed that would be the last of their interaction. Even though they both lived in London, apparently, it didn\u2019t mean they\u2019d see each other around, the way Phil had suggested. London was a pretty big city, after all. He couldn\u2019t help but hope, just a little bit, but instead of dwelling on that, Dan opened up his phone to check his text from Josh.</p><p>Josh: dude it cant be taking that long to check how long your flights gonna be<br>Dan: fuck sorry. <br>Dan: it got cancelled<br>Dan: have to wait till morning. maybe longer<br>Josh: damn. gettin kinda boring around here w/out you<br>Dan: sorry. be home asap<br>Josh: k</p><p>Dan considered telling Josh about Phil, but decided against it last minute. He really didn\u2019t want to be getting a crush on some random guy from the airport based solely on the two sentences they\u2019d exchanged, and telling Josh would only solidify his feelings. Hell, he barely even knew anything about this guy. All he knew is that he lived in London and had family on Isle of Man.</p><p>He headed to the desk to inquire about his flight, only to discover that all flights to London had been cancelled until the next morning due to bad weather. He gave Josh the heads-up that he would be stuck overnight, then decided to head to the nearest place selling food. That place just so happened to be a Burger King, and Dan just so happened to run into Phil while in said Burger King. Quite literally run into him.</p><p>He was looking down at his phone, texting with Josh, when he slammed into someone.</p><p>\u201cFuck. Sorry.\u201d He looked up only to see that that someone was Phil. \u201cFuck,\u201d he said again.</p><p>\u201cHey, Dan,\u201d Phil said, laughing. \u201cTold you I\u2019d see you around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry.\u201d Dan couldn\u2019t help but chuckle a little bit, too; Phil\u2019s smile really was contagious.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright. You might wanna watch where you\u2019re going, though; next time it might not be someone as good natured as me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Dan muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you getting?\u201d Phil asked, changing the subject.</p><p>\u201cUh..\u201d Dan hadn\u2019t actually had a chance to check the menu yet, and he didn\u2019t usually end up in Burger Kings in airports talking to strangers about menu items. Are we still strangers? Probably. \u201cProbably a cheeseburger, those are good, I guess. I don\u2019t normally eat at Burger King.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe neither. I have no idea what to get. Maybe I\u2019ll just copy you and get a cheeseburger, but without the cheese.\u201d</p><p>Dan couldn\u2019t help the incredulousness in his voice. \u201cA cheeseburger without the cheese? Isn\u2019t that just a plain burger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Right. Probably.\u201d Phil giggled. It was rare that Dan had an excuse to use the word \u201cgiggled,\u201d but whatever noise just came out of Phil\u2019s mouth definitely qualified as a giggle. Dan almost rolled his eyes at himself for all the words he was using to describe Phil in his head, but narrowly avoided it, thank god. It really would have looked like he was rolling his eyes at Phil, and that would have made him look like a total dick.</p><p>They ended up eating their burgers together at an uncomfortable plastic table. The chairs made Dan feel like he was in primary school again. They chatted a little bit about their families and their roommates, and Dan learned that the two of them had a lot in common - they both had brothers, they both got along quite well with their roommates, and they both liked to play Mario Kart. They also realized they only lived a few blocks away from each other in London, and even frequently inhabited the same Starbucks.</p><p>\u201cHow have we not met each other before? It doesn\u2019t make any sense. We\u2019re practically the same person,\u201d Dan said. \u201cHell, we even go to the same Starbucks! Do you know how often I\u2019m in Starbucks?\u201d Dan was genuinely confused about how he didn\u2019t already know this guy.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we\u2019ve seen each other before and just didn\u2019t notice? I mean, there are a lot of people in that Starbucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Dan was pretty sure he\u2019d have noticed if he had seen Phil before, though. For one, he was almost as tall as Dan, and that was pretty damn tall. He was also, as Dan couldn\u2019t stop thinking about, incredibly handsome, and had a pretty big personality - he was wearing a bright red sweater with ladybug spots all over it, and Dan got the feeling wearing something as brightly colored as that wasn\u2019t unusual for him. It suited him, though. It brings out the bright blue of his eyes. There he went again. Thinking about Phil\u2019s appearance while he was supposed to be having a conversation.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of Starbucks - I could really use some coffee. Do you know if there\u2019s one around here?\u201d Dan really was starting to get tired. It was already 9pm, but he might as well get caffeinated if he was gonna be stuck at the airport until the next day.</p><p>\u201cThere must be,\u201d Phil replied, tapping his chin in thought. \u201cHey! I know! We can try all the holiday drinks!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what, why not? It\u2019s not like we\u2019re in a hurry.\u201d</p><p>They got up and threw out their trash, then headed into the long, plain airport hallway to try and find a Starbucks. They walked past plenty of little shops, selling things like magazines, candy, and makeup. Why anyone would want to buy makeup from an airport stand, Dan had no idea. He also learned that Phil had a bit of a sweet tooth, as he insisted they stop and get candy along the way. Dan expected him to just get something little, like a bag of M&amp;Ms, but instead he came out of the shop with an entire plastic bag of all sorts of candy.</p><p>\u201cThat is so much candy, Phil. Are you really going to eat all of that?\u201d Shit. Dan realized too late how judgemental that might have sounded, but luckily Phil didn\u2019t seem to take it that way.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t decide, so I got one of everything,\u201d Phil said, giggling again. God, that giggle had to be one of the cutest things Dan had ever heard. \u201cBesides, there\u2019s two of us, and we\u2019ve got all night. We might as well stock up on some snacks.\u201d</p><p>At that, Dan blushed a little bit. Did Phil really plan on spending all night with him? Dan wasn\u2019t complaining, of course, but he also wasn\u2019t expecting that.</p><p>\u201cWell, alright, then,\u201d Dan agreed after regaining his composure. This one guy who he barely knew shouldn\u2019t be ruffling his feathers this much. \u201cThat\u2019s still a shit tonne of candy, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s not just candy. There\u2019s popcorn and marshmallows, too!\u201d Phil had already started walking, and Dan had to jog a little to catch up.</p><p>\u201cMarshmallows?\u201d Dan asked, incredulous.</p><p>\u201cYeah! We can add them to coffee. They taste pretty good on their own, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd popcorn? Is there even a microwave around here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure we can find one. We can do anything we set our hearts to, Dan!\u201d Phil was so enthusiastic, Dan couldn\u2019t help but feel like they really could do anything.</p><p>\u201cSo, we can just make a microwave materialize if we can\u2019t find one?\u201d Dan might have felt inspired by Phil\u2019s little speech, but he couldn\u2019t help teasing him a little bit. Phil never responded, though, because he saw the Starbucks at the end of the hall and began to, well, skip towards it, dragging his suitcase and bag of candy behind him. Dan jogged a bit to catch up, and by the time he got there, Phil was waiting in line, out of breath.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you run? It\u2019s not like we\u2019re in a hurry,\u201d Dan said in between gasps for breath. He really hated running. A lot.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Phil was panting, too, but he wasn\u2019t as out of breath as Dan. \u201cI got excited, I guess. I really don\u2019t like to run, though, I don\u2019t know what I was thinking.\u201d Dan laughed and agreed. The line was moving fast, though, and by the time they had both caught their breath, they were at the front of the line.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I get you guys?\u201d The woman working the counter looked exhausted, and spoke in a completely monotone voice with no emotion on her face. Dan forgave her for her sullenness, though, because it was almost 10pm and she must have dealt with a crap tonne of grumpy airport goers today.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take one of all of your holiday specials, please.\u201d At Phil\u2019s request, the cashier definitely showed some emotion - pure confusion.</p><p>\u201cAll of them? You know there\u2019s more than 20, right?\u201d</p><p>Seeing Phil was about to nod his head, Dan cut in.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you pick five of your favorites?\u201d he suggested to the woman. And then to Phil, he said, \u201cWe really won\u2019t be able to get through 20 cups of coffee. Even if we\u2019ve got all night.\u201d</p><p>Phil still looked a little disappointed, but agreed in the end. Dan knew they\u2019d be better off without 20 cups of coffee to get through.</p><p>When the coffee was finally done, Dan steered them to the booths in one of the terminals. It was still pretty uncomfortable, but less so then the plastic tables they\u2019d eaten their burgers at. After trying - and finishing - all of the coffee, both Dan and Phil were very hyper. Dan solved this problem by fidgeting and bouncing his knee, but Phil, being much less shy, quite literally got up and began skipping around the mostly empty terminal.</p><p>Phil hopped back to Dan and did a little twirl in front of him, then started dancing to whatever shitty music airports played at 11pm. Dan realized that, with every stupid thing Phil did, Dan\u2019s crush only grew. He laughed and pulled out his phone camera to record Phil. He wanted to remember this night forever, even if he never saw Phil again. He really didn\u2019t like the idea of that, though. He decided that he would see this dork again, even if he didn\u2019t quite know how or when that would happen.</p><p>After he recorded for a couple minutes, Phil came over and sat down next to him, a little out of breath. Phil pulled his phone out of his pocket and then sat it down again.</p><p>\u201cShit. My phone\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, you swore! I think I\u2019m a bad influence on you.\u201d</p><p>Phil giggled again. \u201cNah. I swear a lot. But I lose my filter more when I\u2019m this caffeinated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, do you have a charger?\u201d Dan asked.</p><p>Phil reached into his smaller carry-on bag and fished around for a while.</p><p>\u201cCrap. I think it\u2019s in my suitcase or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s find it then.\u201d Dan had already flipped Phil\u2019s suitcase unto its back and started unzipping it. When he flipped the top open, he discovered that his earlier assumption that Phil wore bright clothes all the time was confirmed. Everything in his suitcase was blindingly bright.</p><p>After digging though his suitcase together for a while, Dan finally felt his hand hit something metal. He pulled the cord out victoriously.</p><p>\u201cHa! Found the bastard.\u201d</p><p>Phil cheered.</p><p>\u201cWait, where\u2019s the adaptor cube?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrap. Uhh.. I don\u2019t see one. Did you feel anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might have left it at my parent\u2019s house. I can text my brother, I think he\u2019s still there. Wait, never mind, my phone\u2019s dead. Can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid the place we got the candy from have chargers? We could buy a cube there,\u201d Dan suggested.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think so. Field trip!\u201d Phil hopped up from his seat on the floor, then promptly sat down again. \u201cWait, do you know where it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on. Their website has a map I can pull up\u2026 This says it\u2019s a five minute walk from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gay and caffeinated, it\u2019ll only take three. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Oh. Phil was gay. It hadn\u2019t even occurred to Dan that he wouldn\u2019t be. Of course he shouldn\u2019t have assumed, but it was ok that he had because Phil was. Thank god, Phil was gay.</p><p>Dan must have froze up because Phil turned to look at him funny.</p><p>\u201cEverything ok?\u201d Dan could almost watch Phil close off a little. \u201cUnless there\u2019s something wrong with me being gay\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo no no, of course not. Me too. I mean, I\u2019m gay, too. Well, not gay. Bi. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being gay. Sorry.\u201d Dan tripped over his words so many times, he wasn\u2019t sure if Phil knew what he meant, but he seemed to understand because Phil began to look relieved.</p><p>\u201cOk. Good. Me too. Bi, I mean. I\u2019m bi too.\u201d Dan laughed at their awkwardness, and Phil joined in. Dan stood up off the floor, and extended a hand to Phil.</p><p>\u201cShall we go get your phone charger, then?\u201d</p><p>Phil grasped his hand, and Dan blushed a little at the sudden contact.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Dan expected Phil to let go of his hand once he stood up, but he didn\u2019t, grabbing his suitcase in his other hand and pulling Dan in the direction of the shop.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Dan laughed. \u201cI gotta grab my suitcase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOops.\u201d Phil looked sheepish, and dropped Dan\u2019s hand, blushing. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>Dan, also blushing, just grabbed Phil\u2019s hand back in response.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ok. That is, if it\u2019s ok with you?\u201d</p><p>Phil just squeezed his hand a little and set off once again.</p><p>Still holding hands, they soon arrived at the shop. It really did only take them about three minutes, but Dan wasn\u2019t sure whether that was because they were \u201cgay and caffeinated,\u201d as Phil had said, or just because the airport was so empty. There really are surprisingly few people here. Maybe everyone went to hotels. That would have been a good idea. Oh. No. It wouldn\u2019t have. I wouldn\u2019t get this night with Phil.</p><p>After they grabbed a cube, Phil suggested they go find the terminal back for the flight back to London so they could be ready when the time came. After wandering the airport for another 10 minutes, they finally found a packed terminal full of all the Londoners. That must be where all the people went. They just came here instead of wandering the airport.</p><p>Phil spotted a charging port across the room and pulled Dan in that direction. They finally wove their way over there - it would have been a lot easier to let go of each other, but neither of them seemed willing to do so.</p><p>\u201cCrap. All the spots are taken. Do you see another one?\u201d Phil asked. He was still holding his giant bag of candy, which he waved in the air. \u201cWe can eat all this as soon as we get my phone plugged in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you wanna go over to another empty terminal? I think the one we were in before had a plug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk!\u201d Phil still seemed cheerful from the coffee, but Dan felt like he was starting to crash a little and really just wanted to sit down.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one right over there.\u201d He raised the hand that was holding Phil\u2019s to point them in the right direction. Holding Phil\u2019s hand. He was holding Phil\u2019s hand! Even in his mildly delirious and exhausted state, he couldn\u2019t help but smile.</p><p>With every passing second, Dan was getting more and more tired. As the effects of caffeine wore off, his body seemed to start to remember that it was nearly 2am. After Phil plugged in his phone, Dan pulled a charger out of his bag and plugged his in, too, not thinking anything of it.</p><p>\u201cWait! You had a charger this whole time?\u201d Phil seemed very awake still.</p><p>\u201cShit. I did.\u201d Dan started laughing, and Phil did, too. They eventually collapsed on one of the benches together, and Dan rested his head on Phil\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sleepy,\u201d Dan mumbled into Phil\u2019s shoulder, probably barely audible.</p><p>\u201cGo to sleep then, Dan,\u201d Phil whispered back.</p><p>\u201cMkay.\u201d Dan curled up on the bench, his head in Phil\u2019s lap, and almost instantly fell asleep.</p><p>\u2014\u2014</p><p>Dan awoke what must have been a few hours later with Phil shaking his shoulder gently.</p><p>\u201cDan\u2026 Wake up. I gotta go, they just called my flight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, you\u2019re leaving?\u201d Dan was suddenly very awake and sat up straight. Not yet! Phil can\u2019t be leaving! He felt he could spend forever with Phil, and they only had a couple minutes left, maybe less.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019ll miss you, Dan.\u201d Phil started to stand up, but Dan grabbed his hand.</p><p>\u201cWait. Gimme your phone.\u201d Phil unlocked his phone and handed it to Dan, who quickly added himself to Phil\u2019s contacts. \u201cCall me. I wanna see you again. I really like you, Phil.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t normally this blunt, but he was tired, and this was his last chance to persuade Phil to see him again.</p><p>\u201cI really like you, too, Dan.\u201d Phil\u2019s voice was softer than Dan had ever heard it. \u201cI\u2019ll call, I promise.\u201d</p><p>Phil leaned forward and kissed Dan on the cheek. \u201cSee you around, Dan.\u201d</p><p>And with that, Phil walked away, leaving Dan flustered and blushing, standing in the middle of an airport terminal.</p>",

You should definitely go give both of them some love! Now, without further ado, Airport Coffee.\u00a0</p><hr><p>Pairing: Phan, obviously.\u00a0</p><p>Summary:\u00a0Complete strangers Dan and Phil get stranded in an airport together overnight. Lots of gay, caffeinated antics ensue.</p><p>Warnings: None, let me know if I missed something but it\u2019s just pretty fluffy.\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17635916/chapters/41584631\">Read it on AO3\u00a0</a>\u00a0</p><p>Dan reached into his pocket in response to the small buzz that had come from his phone to see a text from his roommate, Josh. \u201cETA?\u201d it read. He typed out a quick response promising to check, then headed over to the flight information board to check his plane\u2019s estimated arrival.</p><p>He arrived at the screens at the same time as another man around his age, who Dan immediately noticed was, well, incredibly handsome. Just as he tried to find his flight number, all of the boards flashed with the message \u201cFLIGHT BA2491A TO LONDON - CANCELLED.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck. Fuck fuck fuck.\u201d</p><p>Dan didn\u2019t mean to swear as loudly as he did, and blushed when the raven-haired man next to him chuckled. Since when did Dan start referring to people as \u201craven-haired?\u201d What was he talking about?</p>[[MORE]]<p>He was jolted from his thoughts by someone asking, \u201cLondon?\u201d He didn\u2019t realize they were talking to him, but glanced over to see the man looking at him.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dan muttered. He was not a fan of talking to random strangers in airports, even incredibly handsome ones. God, what\u2019s gotten into me? He wasn\u2019t normally like this. Especially not to strangers. At the very least, he could normally get through one sentence without thinking of someone as \u201craven-haired\u201d and \u201cincredibly handsome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too. Although, I guess this isn\u2019t the worst airport to get stuck in\u2026 I\u2019m Phil, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan. Nice to meet you. Uh, what brings you to Isle of Man?\u201d Dan supposed that if he was going to be stuck here, he might as well talk to someone.</p><p>\u201cFamily. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust visiting some old friends for a few days.\u201d Phil\u2019s response had been so blunt, Dan kept his pretty short as well. Maybe he was annoying Phil and should just shut up. Or maybe he was just overthinking things. Fuck.</p><p>Dan\u2019s phone buzzed against his leg again, reminding him of why he was checking the flights in the first place.</p><p>\u201cCrap, that\u2019ll be my roommate. I gotta reply to this, sorry,\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ok. I should go try to figure out a flight. See you around, Dan,\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye.\u201d</p><p>Dan assumed that would be the last of their interaction. Even though they both lived in London, apparently, it didn\u2019t mean they\u2019d see each other around, the way Phil had suggested. London was a pretty big city, after all. He couldn\u2019t help but hope, just a little bit, but instead of dwelling on that, Dan opened up his phone to check his text from Josh.</p><p>Josh: dude it cant be taking that long to check how long your flights gonna be<br>Dan: fuck sorry. <br>Dan: it got cancelled<br>Dan: have to wait till morning. maybe longer<br>Josh: damn. gettin kinda boring around here w/out you<br>Dan: sorry. be home asap<br>Josh: k</p><p>Dan considered telling Josh about Phil, but decided against it last minute. He really didn\u2019t want to be getting a crush on some random guy from the airport based solely on the two sentences they\u2019d exchanged, and telling Josh would only solidify his feelings. Hell, he barely even knew anything about this guy. All he knew is that he lived in London and had family on Isle of Man.</p><p>He headed to the desk to inquire about his flight, only to discover that all flights to London had been cancelled until the next morning due to bad weather. He gave Josh the heads-up that he would be stuck overnight, then decided to head to the nearest place selling food. That place just so happened to be a Burger King, and Dan just so happened to run into Phil while in said Burger King. Quite literally run into him.</p><p>He was looking down at his phone, texting with Josh, when he slammed into someone.</p><p>\u201cFuck. Sorry.\u201d He looked up only to see that that someone was Phil. \u201cFuck,\u201d he said again.</p><p>\u201cHey, Dan,\u201d Phil said, laughing. \u201cTold you I\u2019d see you around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry.\u201d Dan couldn\u2019t help but chuckle a little bit, too; Phil\u2019s smile really was contagious.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright. You might wanna watch where you\u2019re going, though; next time it might not be someone as good natured as me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Dan muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you getting?\u201d Phil asked, changing the subject.</p><p>\u201cUh..\u201d Dan hadn\u2019t actually had a chance to check the menu yet, and he didn\u2019t usually end up in Burger Kings in airports talking to strangers about menu items. Are we still strangers? Probably. \u201cProbably a cheeseburger, those are good, I guess. I don\u2019t normally eat at Burger King.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe neither. I have no idea what to get. Maybe I\u2019ll just copy you and get a cheeseburger, but without the cheese.\u201d</p><p>Dan couldn\u2019t help the incredulousness in his voice. \u201cA cheeseburger without the cheese? Isn\u2019t that just a plain burger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Right. Probably.\u201d Phil giggled. It was rare that Dan had an excuse to use the word \u201cgiggled,\u201d but whatever noise just came out of Phil\u2019s mouth definitely qualified as a giggle. Dan almost rolled his eyes at himself for all the words he was using to describe Phil in his head, but narrowly avoided it, thank god. It really would have looked like he was rolling his eyes at Phil, and that would have made him look like a total dick.</p><p>They ended up eating their burgers together at an uncomfortable plastic table. The chairs made Dan feel like he was in primary school again. They chatted a little bit about their families and their roommates, and Dan learned that the two of them had a lot in common - they both had brothers, they both got along quite well with their roommates, and they both liked to play Mario Kart. They also realized they only lived a few blocks away from each other in London, and even frequently inhabited the same Starbucks.</p><p>\u201cHow have we not met each other before? It doesn\u2019t make any sense. We\u2019re practically the same person,\u201d Dan said. \u201cHell, we even go to the same Starbucks! Do you know how often I\u2019m in Starbucks?\u201d Dan was genuinely confused about how he didn\u2019t already know this guy.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we\u2019ve seen each other before and just didn\u2019t notice? I mean, there are a lot of people in that Starbucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Dan was pretty sure he\u2019d have noticed if he had seen Phil before, though. For one, he was almost as tall as Dan, and that was pretty damn tall. He was also, as Dan couldn\u2019t stop thinking about, incredibly handsome, and had a pretty big personality - he was wearing a bright red sweater with ladybug spots all over it, and Dan got the feeling wearing something as brightly colored as that wasn\u2019t unusual for him. It suited him, though. It brings out the bright blue of his eyes. There he went again. Thinking about Phil\u2019s appearance while he was supposed to be having a conversation.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of Starbucks - I could really use some coffee. Do you know if there\u2019s one around here?\u201d Dan really was starting to get tired. It was already 9pm, but he might as well get caffeinated if he was gonna be stuck at the airport until the next day.</p><p>\u201cThere must be,\u201d Phil replied, tapping his chin in thought. \u201cHey! I know! We can try all the holiday drinks!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what, why not? It\u2019s not like we\u2019re in a hurry.\u201d</p><p>They got up and threw out their trash, then headed into the long, plain airport hallway to try and find a Starbucks. They walked past plenty of little shops, selling things like magazines, candy, and makeup. Why anyone would want to buy makeup from an airport stand, Dan had no idea. He also learned that Phil had a bit of a sweet tooth, as he insisted they stop and get candy along the way. Dan expected him to just get something little, like a bag of M&amp;Ms, but instead he came out of the shop with an entire plastic bag of all sorts of candy.</p><p>\u201cThat is so much candy, Phil. Are you really going to eat all of that?\u201d Shit. Dan realized too late how judgemental that might have sounded, but luckily Phil didn\u2019t seem to take it that way.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t decide, so I got one of everything,\u201d Phil said, giggling again. God, that giggle had to be one of the cutest things Dan had ever heard. \u201cBesides, there\u2019s two of us, and we\u2019ve got all night. We might as well stock up on some snacks.\u201d</p><p>At that, Dan blushed a little bit. Did Phil really plan on spending all night with him? Dan wasn\u2019t complaining, of course, but he also wasn\u2019t expecting that.</p><p>\u201cWell, alright, then,\u201d Dan agreed after regaining his composure. This one guy who he barely knew shouldn\u2019t be ruffling his feathers this much. \u201cThat\u2019s still a shit tonne of candy, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s not just candy. There\u2019s popcorn and marshmallows, too!\u201d Phil had already started walking, and Dan had to jog a little to catch up.</p><p>\u201cMarshmallows?\u201d Dan asked, incredulous.</p><p>\u201cYeah! We can add them to coffee. They taste pretty good on their own, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd popcorn? Is there even a microwave around here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure we can find one. We can do anything we set our hearts to, Dan!\u201d Phil was so enthusiastic, Dan couldn\u2019t help but feel like they really could do anything.</p><p>\u201cSo, we can just make a microwave materialize if we can\u2019t find one?\u201d Dan might have felt inspired by Phil\u2019s little speech, but he couldn\u2019t help teasing him a little bit. Phil never responded, though, because he saw the Starbucks at the end of the hall and began to, well, skip towards it, dragging his suitcase and bag of candy behind him. Dan jogged a bit to catch up, and by the time he got there, Phil was waiting in line, out of breath.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you run? It\u2019s not like we\u2019re in a hurry,\u201d Dan said in between gasps for breath. He really hated running. A lot.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Phil was panting, too, but he wasn\u2019t as out of breath as Dan. \u201cI got excited, I guess. I really don\u2019t like to run, though, I don\u2019t know what I was thinking.\u201d Dan laughed and agreed. The line was moving fast, though, and by the time they had both caught their breath, they were at the front of the line.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I get you guys?\u201d The woman working the counter looked exhausted, and spoke in a completely monotone voice with no emotion on her face. Dan forgave her for her sullenness, though, because it was almost 10pm and she must have dealt with a crap tonne of grumpy airport goers today.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take one of all of your holiday specials, please.\u201d At Phil\u2019s request, the cashier definitely showed some emotion - pure confusion.</p><p>\u201cAll of them? You know there\u2019s more than 20, right?\u201d</p><p>Seeing Phil was about to nod his head, Dan cut in.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you pick five of your favorites?\u201d he suggested to the woman. And then to Phil, he said, \u201cWe really won\u2019t be able to get through 20 cups of coffee. Even if we\u2019ve got all night.\u201d</p><p>Phil still looked a little disappointed, but agreed in the end. Dan knew they\u2019d be better off without 20 cups of coffee to get through.</p><p>When the coffee was finally done, Dan steered them to the booths in one of the terminals. It was still pretty uncomfortable, but less so then the plastic tables they\u2019d eaten their burgers at. After trying - and finishing - all of the coffee, both Dan and Phil were very hyper. Dan solved this problem by fidgeting and bouncing his knee, but Phil, being much less shy, quite literally got up and began skipping around the mostly empty terminal.</p><p>Phil hopped back to Dan and did a little twirl in front of him, then started dancing to whatever shitty music airports played at 11pm. Dan realized that, with every stupid thing Phil did, Dan\u2019s crush only grew. He laughed and pulled out his phone camera to record Phil. He wanted to remember this night forever, even if he never saw Phil again. He really didn\u2019t like the idea of that, though. He decided that he would see this dork again, even if he didn\u2019t quite know how or when that would happen.</p><p>After he recorded for a couple minutes, Phil came over and sat down next to him, a little out of breath. Phil pulled his phone out of his pocket and then sat it down again.</p><p>\u201cShit. My phone\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, you swore! I think I\u2019m a bad influence on you.\u201d</p><p>Phil giggled again. \u201cNah. I swear a lot. But I lose my filter more when I\u2019m this caffeinated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, do you have a charger?\u201d Dan asked.</p><p>Phil reached into his smaller carry-on bag and fished around for a while.</p><p>\u201cCrap. I think it\u2019s in my suitcase or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s find it then.\u201d Dan had already flipped Phil\u2019s suitcase unto its back and started unzipping it. When he flipped the top open, he discovered that his earlier assumption that Phil wore bright clothes all the time was confirmed. Everything in his suitcase was blindingly bright.</p><p>After digging though his suitcase together for a while, Dan finally felt his hand hit something metal. He pulled the cord out victoriously.</p><p>\u201cHa! Found the bastard.\u201d</p><p>Phil cheered.</p><p>\u201cWait, where\u2019s the adaptor cube?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrap. Uhh.. I don\u2019t see one. Did you feel anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might have left it at my parent\u2019s house. I can text my brother, I think he\u2019s still there. Wait, never mind, my phone\u2019s dead. Can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid the place we got the candy from have chargers? We could buy a cube there,\u201d Dan suggested.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think so. Field trip!\u201d Phil hopped up from his seat on the floor, then promptly sat down again. \u201cWait, do you know where it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on. Their website has a map I can pull up\u2026 This says it\u2019s a five minute walk from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gay and caffeinated, it\u2019ll only take three. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Oh. Phil was gay. It hadn\u2019t even occurred to Dan that he wouldn\u2019t be. Of course he shouldn\u2019t have assumed, but it was ok that he had because Phil was. Thank god, Phil was gay.</p><p>Dan must have froze up because Phil turned to look at him funny.</p><p>\u201cEverything ok?\u201d Dan could almost watch Phil close off a little. \u201cUnless there\u2019s something wrong with me being gay\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo no no, of course not. Me too. I mean, I\u2019m gay, too. Well, not gay. Bi. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being gay. Sorry.\u201d Dan tripped over his words so many times, he wasn\u2019t sure if Phil knew what he meant, but he seemed to understand because Phil began to look relieved.</p><p>\u201cOk. Good. Me too. Bi, I mean. I\u2019m bi too.\u201d Dan laughed at their awkwardness, and Phil joined in. Dan stood up off the floor, and extended a hand to Phil.</p><p>\u201cShall we go get your phone charger, then?\u201d</p><p>Phil grasped his hand, and Dan blushed a little at the sudden contact.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Dan expected Phil to let go of his hand once he stood up, but he didn\u2019t, grabbing his suitcase in his other hand and pulling Dan in the direction of the shop.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Dan laughed. \u201cI gotta grab my suitcase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOops.\u201d Phil looked sheepish, and dropped Dan\u2019s hand, blushing. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>Dan, also blushing, just grabbed Phil\u2019s hand back in response.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ok. That is, if it\u2019s ok with you?\u201d</p><p>Phil just squeezed his hand a little and set off once again.</p><p>Still holding hands, they soon arrived at the shop. It really did only take them about three minutes, but Dan wasn\u2019t sure whether that was because they were \u201cgay and caffeinated,\u201d as Phil had said, or just because the airport was so empty. There really are surprisingly few people here. Maybe everyone went to hotels. That would have been a good idea. Oh. No. It wouldn\u2019t have. I wouldn\u2019t get this night with Phil.</p><p>After they grabbed a cube, Phil suggested they go find the terminal back for the flight back to London so they could be ready when the time came. After wandering the airport for another 10 minutes, they finally found a packed terminal full of all the Londoners. That must be where all the people went. They just came here instead of wandering the airport.</p><p>Phil spotted a charging port across the room and pulled Dan in that direction. They finally wove their way over there - it would have been a lot easier to let go of each other, but neither of them seemed willing to do so.</p><p>\u201cCrap. All the spots are taken. Do you see another one?\u201d Phil asked. He was still holding his giant bag of candy, which he waved in the air. \u201cWe can eat all this as soon as we get my phone plugged in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you wanna go over to another empty terminal? I think the one we were in before had a plug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk!\u201d Phil still seemed cheerful from the coffee, but Dan felt like he was starting to crash a little and really just wanted to sit down.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one right over there.\u201d He raised the hand that was holding Phil\u2019s to point them in the right direction. Holding Phil\u2019s hand. He was holding Phil\u2019s hand! Even in his mildly delirious and exhausted state, he couldn\u2019t help but smile.</p><p>With every passing second, Dan was getting more and more tired. As the effects of caffeine wore off, his body seemed to start to remember that it was nearly 2am. After Phil plugged in his phone, Dan pulled a charger out of his bag and plugged his in, too, not thinking anything of it.</p><p>\u201cWait! You had a charger this whole time?\u201d Phil seemed very awake still.</p><p>\u201cShit. I did.\u201d Dan started laughing, and Phil did, too. They eventually collapsed on one of the benches together, and Dan rested his head on Phil\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sleepy,\u201d Dan mumbled into Phil\u2019s shoulder, probably barely audible.</p><p>\u201cGo to sleep then, Dan,\u201d Phil whispered back.</p><p>\u201cMkay.\u201d Dan curled up on the bench, his head in Phil\u2019s lap, and almost instantly fell asleep.</p><p>\u2014\u2014</p><p>Dan awoke what must have been a few hours later with Phil shaking his shoulder gently.</p><p>\u201cDan\u2026 Wake up. I gotta go, they just called my flight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, you\u2019re leaving?\u201d Dan was suddenly very awake and sat up straight. Not yet! Phil can\u2019t be leaving! He felt he could spend forever with Phil, and they only had a couple minutes left, maybe less.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019ll miss you, Dan.\u201d Phil started to stand up, but Dan grabbed his hand.</p><p>\u201cWait. Gimme your phone.\u201d Phil unlocked his phone and handed it to Dan, who quickly added himself to Phil\u2019s contacts. \u201cCall me. I wanna see you again. I really like you, Phil.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t normally this blunt, but he was tired, and this was his last chance to persuade Phil to see him again.</p><p>\u201cI really like you, too, Dan.\u201d Phil\u2019s voice was softer than Dan had ever heard it. \u201cI\u2019ll call, I promise.\u201d</p><p>Phil leaned forward and kissed Dan on the cheek. \u201cSee you around, Dan.\u201d</p><p>And with that, Phil walked away, leaving Dan flustered and blushing, standing in the middle of an airport terminal.</p>",

You should definitely go give both of them some love! Now, without further ado, Airport Coffee.&nbsp;</p><hr /><p>Pairing: Phan, obviously.&nbsp;</p><p>Summary:&nbsp;Complete strangers Dan and Phil get stranded in an airport together overnight. Lots of gay, caffeinated antics ensue.</p><p>Warnings: None, let me know if I missed something but it&rsquo;s just pretty fluffy.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17635916/chapters/41584631\">Read it on AO3&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Dan reached into his pocket in response to the small buzz that had come from his phone to see a text from his roommate, Josh. &ldquo;ETA?&rdquo; it read. He typed out a quick response promising to check, then headed over to the flight information board to check his plane&rsquo;s estimated arrival.</p><p>He arrived at the screens at the same time as another man around his age, who Dan immediately noticed was, well, incredibly handsome. Just as he tried to find his flight number, all of the boards flashed with the message &ldquo;FLIGHT BA2491A TO LONDON - CANCELLED.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck. Fuck fuck fuck.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan didn&rsquo;t mean to swear as loudly as he did, and blushed when the raven-haired man next to him chuckled. Since when did Dan start referring to people as &ldquo;raven-haired?&rdquo; What was he talking about?</p><p>He was jolted from his thoughts by someone asking, &ldquo;London?&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t realize they were talking to him, but glanced over to see the man looking at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Dan muttered. He was not a fan of talking to random strangers in airports, even incredibly handsome ones. God, what&rsquo;s gotten into me? He wasn&rsquo;t normally like this. Especially not to strangers. At the very least, he could normally get through one sentence without thinking of someone as &ldquo;raven-haired&rdquo; and &ldquo;incredibly handsome.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Me, too. Although, I guess this isn&rsquo;t the worst airport to get stuck in&hellip; I&rsquo;m Phil, by the way.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dan. Nice to meet you. Uh, what brings you to Isle of Man?&rdquo; Dan supposed that if he was going to be stuck here, he might as well talk to someone.</p><p>&ldquo;Family. You?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just visiting some old friends for a few days.&rdquo; Phil&rsquo;s response had been so blunt, Dan kept his pretty short as well. Maybe he was annoying Phil and should just shut up. Or maybe he was just overthinking things. Fuck.</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s phone buzzed against his leg again, reminding him of why he was checking the flights in the first place.</p><p>&ldquo;Crap, that&rsquo;ll be my roommate. I gotta reply to this, sorry,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ok. I should go try to figure out a flight. See you around, Dan,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bye.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan assumed that would be the last of their interaction. Even though they both lived in London, apparently, it didn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;d see each other around, the way Phil had suggested. London was a pretty big city, after all. He couldn&rsquo;t help but hope, just a little bit, but instead of dwelling on that, Dan opened up his phone to check his text from Josh.</p><p>Josh: dude it cant be taking that long to check how long your flights gonna be<br />Dan: fuck sorry. <br />Dan: it got cancelled<br />Dan: have to wait till morning. maybe longer<br />Josh: damn. gettin kinda boring around here w/out you<br />Dan: sorry. be home asap<br />Josh: k</p><p>Dan considered telling Josh about Phil, but decided against it last minute. He really didn&rsquo;t want to be getting a crush on some random guy from the airport based solely on the two sentences they&rsquo;d exchanged, and telling Josh would only solidify his feelings. Hell, he barely even knew anything about this guy. All he knew is that he lived in London and had family on Isle of Man.</p><p>He headed to the desk to inquire about his flight, only to discover that all flights to London had been cancelled until the next morning due to bad weather. He gave Josh the heads-up that he would be stuck overnight, then decided to head to the nearest place selling food. That place just so happened to be a Burger King, and Dan just so happened to run into Phil while in said Burger King. Quite literally run into him.</p><p>He was looking down at his phone, texting with Josh, when he slammed into someone.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck. Sorry.&rdquo; He looked up only to see that that someone was Phil. &ldquo;Fuck,&rdquo; he said again.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Dan,&rdquo; Phil said, laughing. &ldquo;Told you I&rsquo;d see you around.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really sorry.&rdquo; Dan couldn&rsquo;t help but chuckle a little bit, too; Phil&rsquo;s smile really was contagious.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright. You might wanna watch where you&rsquo;re going, though; next time it might not be someone as good natured as me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Dan muttered.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you getting?&rdquo; Phil asked, changing the subject.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh..&rdquo; Dan hadn&rsquo;t actually had a chance to check the menu yet, and he didn&rsquo;t usually end up in Burger Kings in airports talking to strangers about menu items. Are we still strangers? Probably. &ldquo;Probably a cheeseburger, those are good, I guess. I don&rsquo;t normally eat at Burger King.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Me neither. I have no idea what to get. Maybe I&rsquo;ll just copy you and get a cheeseburger, but without the cheese.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan couldn&rsquo;t help the incredulousness in his voice. &ldquo;A cheeseburger without the cheese? Isn&rsquo;t that just a plain burger?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh. Right. Probably.&rdquo; Phil giggled. It was rare that Dan had an excuse to use the word &ldquo;giggled,&rdquo; but whatever noise just came out of Phil&rsquo;s mouth definitely qualified as a giggle. Dan almost rolled his eyes at himself for all the words he was using to describe Phil in his head, but narrowly avoided it, thank god. It really would have looked like he was rolling his eyes at Phil, and that would have made him look like a total dick.</p><p>They ended up eating their burgers together at an uncomfortable plastic table. The chairs made Dan feel like he was in primary school again. They chatted a little bit about their families and their roommates, and Dan learned that the two of them had a lot in common - they both had brothers, they both got along quite well with their roommates, and they both liked to play Mario Kart. They also realized they only lived a few blocks away from each other in London, and even frequently inhabited the same Starbucks.</p><p>&ldquo;How have we not met each other before? It doesn&rsquo;t make any sense. We&rsquo;re practically the same person,&rdquo; Dan said. &ldquo;Hell, we even go to the same Starbucks! Do you know how often I&rsquo;m in Starbucks?&rdquo; Dan was genuinely confused about how he didn&rsquo;t already know this guy.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;ve seen each other before and just didn&rsquo;t notice? I mean, there are a lot of people in that Starbucks.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo; Dan was pretty sure he&rsquo;d have noticed if he had seen Phil before, though. For one, he was almost as tall as Dan, and that was pretty damn tall. He was also, as Dan couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about, incredibly handsome, and had a pretty big personality - he was wearing a bright red sweater with ladybug spots all over it, and Dan got the feeling wearing something as brightly colored as that wasn&rsquo;t unusual for him. It suited him, though. It brings out the bright blue of his eyes. There he went again. Thinking about Phil&rsquo;s appearance while he was supposed to be having a conversation.</p><p>&ldquo;Speaking of Starbucks - I could really use some coffee. Do you know if there&rsquo;s one around here?&rdquo; Dan really was starting to get tired. It was already 9pm, but he might as well get caffeinated if he was gonna be stuck at the airport until the next day.</p><p>&ldquo;There must be,&rdquo; Phil replied, tapping his chin in thought. &ldquo;Hey! I know! We can try all the holiday drinks!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know what, why not? It&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;re in a hurry.&rdquo;</p><p>They got up and threw out their trash, then headed into the long, plain airport hallway to try and find a Starbucks. They walked past plenty of little shops, selling things like magazines, candy, and makeup. Why anyone would want to buy makeup from an airport stand, Dan had no idea. He also learned that Phil had a bit of a sweet tooth, as he insisted they stop and get candy along the way. Dan expected him to just get something little, like a bag of M&amp;Ms, but instead he came out of the shop with an entire plastic bag of all sorts of candy.</p><p>&ldquo;That is so much candy, Phil. Are you really going to eat all of that?&rdquo; Shit. Dan realized too late how judgemental that might have sounded, but luckily Phil didn&rsquo;t seem to take it that way.</p><p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t decide, so I got one of everything,&rdquo; Phil said, giggling again. God, that giggle had to be one of the cutest things Dan had ever heard. &ldquo;Besides, there&rsquo;s two of us, and we&rsquo;ve got all night. We might as well stock up on some snacks.&rdquo;</p><p>At that, Dan blushed a little bit. Did Phil really plan on spending all night with him? Dan wasn&rsquo;t complaining, of course, but he also wasn&rsquo;t expecting that.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, alright, then,&rdquo; Dan agreed after regaining his composure. This one guy who he barely knew shouldn&rsquo;t be ruffling his feathers this much. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s still a shit tonne of candy, though.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s not just candy. There&rsquo;s popcorn and marshmallows, too!&rdquo; Phil had already started walking, and Dan had to jog a little to catch up.</p><p>&ldquo;Marshmallows?&rdquo; Dan asked, incredulous.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah! We can add them to coffee. They taste pretty good on their own, too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And popcorn? Is there even a microwave around here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we can find one. We can do anything we set our hearts to, Dan!&rdquo; Phil was so enthusiastic, Dan couldn&rsquo;t help but feel like they really could do anything.</p><p>&ldquo;So, we can just make a microwave materialize if we can&rsquo;t find one?&rdquo; Dan might have felt inspired by Phil&rsquo;s little speech, but he couldn&rsquo;t help teasing him a little bit. Phil never responded, though, because he saw the Starbucks at the end of the hall and began to, well, skip towards it, dragging his suitcase and bag of candy behind him. Dan jogged a bit to catch up, and by the time he got there, Phil was waiting in line, out of breath.</p><p>&ldquo;Why&rsquo;d you run? It&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;re in a hurry,&rdquo; Dan said in between gasps for breath. He really hated running. A lot.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Phil was panting, too, but he wasn&rsquo;t as out of breath as Dan. &ldquo;I got excited, I guess. I really don&rsquo;t like to run, though, I don&rsquo;t know what I was thinking.&rdquo; Dan laughed and agreed. The line was moving fast, though, and by the time they had both caught their breath, they were at the front of the line.</p><p>&ldquo;What can I get you guys?&rdquo; The woman working the counter looked exhausted, and spoke in a completely monotone voice with no emotion on her face. Dan forgave her for her sullenness, though, because it was almost 10pm and she must have dealt with a crap tonne of grumpy airport goers today.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take one of all of your holiday specials, please.&rdquo; At Phil&rsquo;s request, the cashier definitely showed some emotion - pure confusion.</p><p>&ldquo;All of them? You know there&rsquo;s more than 20, right?&rdquo;</p><p>Seeing Phil was about to nod his head, Dan cut in.</p><p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you pick five of your favorites?&rdquo; he suggested to the woman. And then to Phil, he said, &ldquo;We really won&rsquo;t be able to get through 20 cups of coffee. Even if we&rsquo;ve got all night.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil still looked a little disappointed, but agreed in the end. Dan knew they&rsquo;d be better off without 20 cups of coffee to get through.</p><p>When the coffee was finally done, Dan steered them to the booths in one of the terminals. It was still pretty uncomfortable, but less so then the plastic tables they&rsquo;d eaten their burgers at. After trying - and finishing - all of the coffee, both Dan and Phil were very hyper. Dan solved this problem by fidgeting and bouncing his knee, but Phil, being much less shy, quite literally got up and began skipping around the mostly empty terminal.</p><p>Phil hopped back to Dan and did a little twirl in front of him, then started dancing to whatever shitty music airports played at 11pm. Dan realized that, with every stupid thing Phil did, Dan&rsquo;s crush only grew. He laughed and pulled out his phone camera to record Phil. He wanted to remember this night forever, even if he never saw Phil again. He really didn&rsquo;t like the idea of that, though. He decided that he would see this dork again, even if he didn&rsquo;t quite know how or when that would happen.</p><p>After he recorded for a couple minutes, Phil came over and sat down next to him, a little out of breath. Phil pulled his phone out of his pocket and then sat it down again.</p><p>&ldquo;Shit. My phone&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, you swore! I think I&rsquo;m a bad influence on you.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil giggled again. &ldquo;Nah. I swear a lot. But I lose my filter more when I&rsquo;m this caffeinated.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, do you have a charger?&rdquo; Dan asked.</p><p>Phil reached into his smaller carry-on bag and fished around for a while.</p><p>&ldquo;Crap. I think it&rsquo;s in my suitcase or something.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s find it then.&rdquo; Dan had already flipped Phil&rsquo;s suitcase unto its back and started unzipping it. When he flipped the top open, he discovered that his earlier assumption that Phil wore bright clothes all the time was confirmed. Everything in his suitcase was blindingly bright.</p><p>After digging though his suitcase together for a while, Dan finally felt his hand hit something metal. He pulled the cord out victoriously.</p><p>&ldquo;Ha! Found the bastard.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil cheered.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, where&rsquo;s the adaptor cube?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Crap. Uhh.. I don&rsquo;t see one. Did you feel anything?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nope.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I might have left it at my parent&rsquo;s house. I can text my brother, I think he&rsquo;s still there. Wait, never mind, my phone&rsquo;s dead. Can&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did the place we got the candy from have chargers? We could buy a cube there,&rdquo; Dan suggested.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I think so. Field trip!&rdquo; Phil hopped up from his seat on the floor, then promptly sat down again. &ldquo;Wait, do you know where it is?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hang on. Their website has a map I can pull up&hellip; This says it&rsquo;s a five minute walk from here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gay and caffeinated, it&rsquo;ll only take three. Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p><p>Oh. Phil was gay. It hadn&rsquo;t even occurred to Dan that he wouldn&rsquo;t be. Of course he shouldn&rsquo;t have assumed, but it was ok that he had because Phil was. Thank god, Phil was gay.</p><p>Dan must have froze up because Phil turned to look at him funny.</p><p>&ldquo;Everything ok?&rdquo; Dan could almost watch Phil close off a little. &ldquo;Unless there&rsquo;s something wrong with me being gay&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No no no, of course not. Me too. I mean, I&rsquo;m gay, too. Well, not gay. Bi. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with being gay. Sorry.&rdquo; Dan tripped over his words so many times, he wasn&rsquo;t sure if Phil knew what he meant, but he seemed to understand because Phil began to look relieved.</p><p>&ldquo;Ok. Good. Me too. Bi, I mean. I&rsquo;m bi too.&rdquo; Dan laughed at their awkwardness, and Phil joined in. Dan stood up off the floor, and extended a hand to Phil.</p><p>&ldquo;Shall we go get your phone charger, then?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil grasped his hand, and Dan blushed a little at the sudden contact.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan expected Phil to let go of his hand once he stood up, but he didn&rsquo;t, grabbing his suitcase in his other hand and pulling Dan in the direction of the shop.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Dan laughed. &ldquo;I gotta grab my suitcase.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oops.&rdquo; Phil looked sheepish, and dropped Dan&rsquo;s hand, blushing. &ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan, also blushing, just grabbed Phil&rsquo;s hand back in response.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ok. That is, if it&rsquo;s ok with you?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil just squeezed his hand a little and set off once again.</p><p>Still holding hands, they soon arrived at the shop. It really did only take them about three minutes, but Dan wasn&rsquo;t sure whether that was because they were &ldquo;gay and caffeinated,&rdquo; as Phil had said, or just because the airport was so empty. There really are surprisingly few people here. Maybe everyone went to hotels. That would have been a good idea. Oh. No. It wouldn&rsquo;t have. I wouldn&rsquo;t get this night with Phil.</p><p>After they grabbed a cube, Phil suggested they go find the terminal back for the flight back to London so they could be ready when the time came. After wandering the airport for another 10 minutes, they finally found a packed terminal full of all the Londoners. That must be where all the people went. They just came here instead of wandering the airport.</p><p>Phil spotted a charging port across the room and pulled Dan in that direction. They finally wove their way over there - it would have been a lot easier to let go of each other, but neither of them seemed willing to do so.</p><p>&ldquo;Crap. All the spots are taken. Do you see another one?&rdquo; Phil asked. He was still holding his giant bag of candy, which he waved in the air. &ldquo;We can eat all this as soon as we get my phone plugged in.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you wanna go over to another empty terminal? I think the one we were in before had a plug.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ok!&rdquo; Phil still seemed cheerful from the coffee, but Dan felt like he was starting to crash a little and really just wanted to sit down.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one right over there.&rdquo; He raised the hand that was holding Phil&rsquo;s to point them in the right direction. Holding Phil&rsquo;s hand. He was holding Phil&rsquo;s hand! Even in his mildly delirious and exhausted state, he couldn&rsquo;t help but smile.</p><p>With every passing second, Dan was getting more and more tired. As the effects of caffeine wore off, his body seemed to start to remember that it was nearly 2am. After Phil plugged in his phone, Dan pulled a charger out of his bag and plugged his in, too, not thinking anything of it.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait! You had a charger this whole time?&rdquo; Phil seemed very awake still.</p><p>&ldquo;Shit. I did.&rdquo; Dan started laughing, and Phil did, too. They eventually collapsed on one of the benches together, and Dan rested his head on Phil&rsquo;s shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sleepy,&rdquo; Dan mumbled into Phil&rsquo;s shoulder, probably barely audible.</p><p>&ldquo;Go to sleep then, Dan,&rdquo; Phil whispered back.</p><p>&ldquo;Mkay.&rdquo; Dan curled up on the bench, his head in Phil&rsquo;s lap, and almost instantly fell asleep.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>Dan awoke what must have been a few hours later with Phil shaking his shoulder gently.</p><p>&ldquo;Dan&hellip; Wake up. I gotta go, they just called my flight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, you&rsquo;re leaving?&rdquo; Dan was suddenly very awake and sat up straight. Not yet! Phil can&rsquo;t be leaving! He felt he could spend forever with Phil, and they only had a couple minutes left, maybe less.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. I&rsquo;ll miss you, Dan.&rdquo; Phil started to stand up, but Dan grabbed his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait. Gimme your phone.&rdquo; Phil unlocked his phone and handed it to Dan, who quickly added himself to Phil&rsquo;s contacts. &ldquo;Call me. I wanna see you again. I really like you, Phil.&rdquo;</p><p>He wasn&rsquo;t normally this blunt, but he was tired, and this was his last chance to persuade Phil to see him again.</p><p>&ldquo;I really like you, too, Dan.&rdquo; Phil&rsquo;s voice was softer than Dan had ever heard it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call, I promise.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil leaned forward and kissed Dan on the cheek. &ldquo;See you around, Dan.&rdquo;</p><p>And with that, Phil walked away, leaving Dan flustered and blushing, standing in the middle of an airport terminal.</p>",

He typed out a quick response promising to check, then headed over to the flight information board to check his plane&rsquo;s estimated arrival.</p>\n<p>He arrived at the screens at the same time as another man around his age, who Dan immediately noticed was, well, incredibly handsome. Just as he tried to find his flight number, all of the boards flashed with the message &ldquo;FLIGHT BA2491A TO LONDON - CANCELLED.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Fuck. Fuck fuck fuck.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Dan didn&rsquo;t mean to swear as loudly as he did, and blushed when the raven-haired man next to him chuckled.

The Howell family and the Lester family. They take every measure they can to avoid each other. When Mrs. Howell and Mrs. Lester had children the same time, they panicked and did everything they could to keep them apart. And it worked, they never met.

Only Dan and Phil won\u2019t accept that. They work together to uncover long buried family secrets, all while switching between hating each other and something more. They find their hatred runs deeper and older than expected.

The Howell family and the Lester family. They take every measure they can to avoid each other. When Mrs. Howell and Mrs. Lester had children the same time, they panicked and did everything they could to keep them apart. And it worked, they never met. Until one night, by chance or fate, they lock eyes for the first time. They were trained to hate each other, the trouble is, neither families know why they hate the other, they just do. Only Dan and Phil won&rsquo;t accept that. They work together to uncover long buried family secrets, all while switching between hating each other and something more. They find their hatred runs deeper and older than expected.

Even when he managed to have the smallest amount of relief, during the night it crept back into the inner consciousness of his mind, never letting him escape the reality that lies hidden in the truth. In the dark corners of his mind were the shadows of happiness that he couldn\u2019t bear to see; the happiness that he felt throughout the day until the cold set in, reminding of the truth that was life.</p><!-- more --><p>Just as the sun rose and everyone was born, all things must come to an end; just as the sun sets in the evening and everyone dies one day. It was a part of life that no one could avoid. Something that comes naturally to everyone, but not something that settles well. For some, they\u2019re okay with it - they just see it as another event in their life, not worrying about what happens or comes after. For others, it\u2019s harder to accept - it fills them with dread and makes them question the point of their entire existence, and whether life is worth what it seems.</p><p>As the warm days draw near, and the light stayed longer to hide the dark, Dan couldn\u2019t help but wander to the dark depths of his mind - wonder on questions he knew there would never be an answer to as long as mankind was alive. It froze him with fear knowing he could never know the answer. That was life; you had to face the unknown head on and you couldn\u2019t question it. But Dan did, and he wished he didn\u2019t, but he couldn\u2019t help how his mind worked and the turns it took.</p><p>The sweat beaded on his palms as he stared up to the ceiling, drawing mindless shapes with his eyes that meant nothing, even to him. His hallowed eyes were fragile, shattering at the slightest utter of a word. The clock read <i>02:00</i>, and he wasn\u2019t drowsy, but quite the opposite despite him not leaving his room in days. <g class=\"gr_ gr_186 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"186\" data-gr-id=\"186\">Crumpled</g> paper was scattered around the floor, the words on the paper meaning nothing to anyone except Dan - words that held his deepest thoughts and worries.</p><p>The question he hadn&rsquo;t been able to figure out, however, was why. Why were we here when we will end up in the ground to rot away over the years? Was there a point to life? No one would be remembered forever, and one day, just like everyone else in history we know, we will fade away and be a star in the sky that we faintly see, but have no recollections of. Was there a point when we will leave behind the ones we love; or when they leave us? \u00a0Dan wasn\u2019t sure he could fathom that. The idea of him leaving Phil hurt, but worse was the idea of Phil leaving him. It struck a nerve deep inside that made him want to scream until his vocal cords ripped, and his throat turned raw, and for what?</p><p>He hadn\u2019t seen Phil in a few days. He couldn\u2019t remember if he was even home, or if he went up north to visit his family. Had Phil forgotten about him? It would only make sense - Dan forgot about himself, why wouldn\u2019t Phil?</p><p>Phil didn\u2019t know the deep thoughts of Dan\u2019s mind, and Dan didn\u2019t want him to. It was dark and he couldn\u2019t drag Phil down with him by opening up. He couldn\u2019t do that to anyone. Nothing about that was fair. Why ruin someone\u2019s happiness just because you can\u2019t find your own?</p><p>Stars die out, but humanity enjoys them. They watch them flicker in the sky, create memories under them. Dan wanted that, to live carelessly and not worry. God, he wanted that more than anything, but when his mind wandered, no matter how hard he tried, he just couldn\u2019t escape.</p><p>A soft knock came from outside in the hall. Dan looked over, not moving his body otherwise, and then returned to looking at the ceiling to draw mindless stars.</p><p>\u201cDan?\u201d Phil\u2019s voice, calm yet drenched in worry, quietly echoed through the door, sounding like screams to Dan. \u201cDan, please. I- <g class=\"gr_ gr_181 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del\" id=\"181\" data-gr-id=\"181\">I\u2019m</g> worried.\u201d</p><p>After a few moments of silence, Phil gently pushed open the door, shutting it behind him. Making his way over to Dan\u2019s bed, stepping on the paper, he climbed across Dan and lied beside him on his side looking at him. \u201cDan, please talk to me. You haven\u2019t come out in days. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>Dan sighed and turned his head towards Phil. He noticed the worry plastered onto Phil\u2019s face that wasn\u2019t leaving anytime soon. He knew he couldn\u2019t avoid this, but he knew he couldn\u2019t tell Phil. To be scared of something so natural was rubbish in his mind.</p><p>\u201cDan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-\u201c Dan sighed deeply and closed his eyes briefly. \u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d he whispered into the air. Confusion crossed Phil\u2019s face a bit.</p><p>\u201cScared? What <g class=\"gr_ gr_182 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del\" id=\"182\" data-gr-id=\"182\">of</g>?\u201d Phil asked, his voice hushed and soft. Dan knew that Phil knew harsh tones and jagged voices hurt him deeply, especially in a state like where he was now.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s stupid really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan, it\u2019s not stupid. We all have our fears, even the silly ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you scared of anything?\u201d Dan looked at Phil, brushing the curls out of his face.</p><p>\u201cHorses.\u201d</p><p>Dan stifled a giggle, \u00a0and Phil smiled. Dan was hurt deep inside, and a small laugh helped in the slightest. It reminded him that somewhere, the truth lies and that one day he won\u2019t have to worry about what\u2019s to come.</p><p>\u201cReally? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you seen them? I don&rsquo;t trust them.\u201d Phil shrugged. \u201cThey could kick you at any moment, and their faces .\u201d He shuddered. \u201cTheir faces are the worst.\u201d</p><p>Dan cracked a smile, one that barely had any sort of feeling and was forced the entire way. \u201cThat\u2019s weird Phil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but just because others see it as weird doesn\u2019t mean anything, Dan. Your fears still matter because you live with them, no matter how silly they seem. If someone is afraid of spiders you don&rsquo;t tell them it\u2019s silly, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2026 I guess not. But what does <g class=\"gr_ gr_179 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"179\" data-gr-id=\"179\">tha</g>-\u201c</p><p>\u201cThen your own aren\u2019t silly either Dan.\u201d Phil interrupted him and sighed. \u201cI can\u2019t make you tell me Dan, but I want to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeath.\u201d Phil cocked his brow slightly as Dan continued. \u201cI\u2019m scared of death and of dying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh Dan,\u201d Phil calmly spoke, laying his hand on Dan\u2019s cheek gently. \u201cThat\u2019s not stupid. It\u2019s valid, you know. Death is scary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhil it basically paralyzes me. It - it entraps me with this fear of not knowing, and makes me question everything until it breaks me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s made to be broken, Dan.\u201d Tears brimmed Dan\u2019s eyes, and Phil pulled him close. \u201cWhat exactly scares you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot knowing if dying hurts, what comes after. What if it\u2019s just lights out, and darkness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring some glow sticks to the afterlife and we\u2019ll shine in the dark,\u201d Phil chuckled and wiped Dan\u2019s eyes. \u201cDan, it\u2019s scary. I know, trust me. But you have to believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn what? I\u2019m scared I\u2019ll die before accomplishing anything, that you\u2019ll die before me and leave me alone in the world, Phil.</p><p>\u201cLife Dan. You have to be willing to just believe that things are more than they seem. I promise we\u2019ll do everything you wish to do before we die. You\u2019ll accomplish everything you can dream of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhil, it\u2019s not that easy.\u201d</p><p>Phil sighed, threading his fingers through Dan\u2019s hair. \u201cI know it isn\u2019t that easy Dan; facing your fears never is. But you have to be able to try and fight on. For example, dandelions. A lot of people see them as weeds and no good. Others see them as this beautiful enchanting thing that has such meaning. Your life is like a dandelion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA flower?\u201d</p><p>Chuckling, Phil laid his head on top of Dan\u2019s. \u201cIt holds more worth than you see from your perspective, Dan. It\u2019ll be okay. Fears are scary, but you can overcome them. It just takes time, and I\u2019ll be there to help you. Even if it means holding your hand every step of the way.\u201d</p>",

The idea of him leaving Phil hurt, but worse was the idea of Phil leaving him. It struck a nerve deep inside that made him want to scream until his vocal cords ripped, and his throat turned raw, and for what?</p><p>He hadn\u2019t seen Phil in a few days. He couldn\u2019t remember if he was even home, or if he went up north to visit his family. Had Phil forgotten about him? It would only make sense - Dan forgot about himself, why wouldn\u2019t Phil?</p><p>Phil didn\u2019t know the deep thoughts of Dan\u2019s mind, and Dan didn\u2019t want him to. It was dark and he couldn\u2019t drag Phil down with him by opening up. He couldn\u2019t do that to anyone. Nothing about that was fair. Why ruin someone\u2019s happiness just because you can\u2019t find your own?</p><p>Stars die out, but humanity enjoys them. They watch them flicker in the sky, create memories under them. Dan wanted that, to live carelessly and not worry. God, he wanted that more than anything, but when his mind wandered, no matter how hard he tried, he just couldn\u2019t escape.</p><p>A soft knock came from outside in the hall. Dan looked over, not moving his body otherwise, and then returned to looking at the ceiling to draw mindless stars.</p><p>\u201cDan?\u201d Phil\u2019s voice, calm yet drenched in worry, quietly echoed through the door, sounding like screams to Dan. \u201cDan, please. I- <g class=\"gr_ gr_181 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del\" id=\"181\" data-gr-id=\"181\">I\u2019m</g> worried.\u201d</p><p>After a few moments of silence, Phil gently pushed open the door, shutting it behind him. Making his way over to Dan\u2019s bed, stepping on the paper, he climbed across Dan and lied beside him on his side looking at him. \u201cDan, please talk to me. You haven\u2019t come out in days. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>Dan sighed and turned his head towards Phil. He noticed the worry plastered onto Phil\u2019s face that wasn\u2019t leaving anytime soon. He knew he couldn\u2019t avoid this, but he knew he couldn\u2019t tell Phil. To be scared of something so natural was rubbish in his mind.</p><p>\u201cDan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-\u201c Dan sighed deeply and closed his eyes briefly. \u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d he whispered into the air. Confusion crossed Phil\u2019s face a bit.</p><p>\u201cScared? What <g class=\"gr_ gr_182 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del\" id=\"182\" data-gr-id=\"182\">of</g>?\u201d Phil asked, his voice hushed and soft. Dan knew that Phil knew harsh tones and jagged voices hurt him deeply, especially in a state like where he was now.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s stupid really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan, it\u2019s not stupid. We all have our fears, even the silly ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you scared of anything?\u201d Dan looked at Phil, brushing the curls out of his face.</p><p>\u201cHorses.\u201d</p><p>Dan stifled a giggle, \u00a0and Phil smiled. Dan was hurt deep inside, and a small laugh helped in the slightest. It reminded him that somewhere, the truth lies and that one day he won\u2019t have to worry about what\u2019s to come.</p><p>\u201cReally? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you seen them? I don\u2019t trust them.\u201d Phil shrugged. \u201cThey could kick you at any moment, and their faces .\u201d He shuddered. \u201cTheir faces are the worst.\u201d</p><p>Dan cracked a smile, one that barely had any sort of feeling and was forced the entire way. \u201cThat\u2019s weird Phil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but just because others see it as weird doesn\u2019t mean anything, Dan. Your fears still matter because you live with them, no matter how silly they seem. If someone is afraid of spiders you don\u2019t tell them it\u2019s silly, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2026 I guess not. But what does <g class=\"gr_ gr_179 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"179\" data-gr-id=\"179\">tha</g>-\u201c</p><p>\u201cThen your own aren\u2019t silly either Dan.\u201d Phil interrupted him and sighed. \u201cI can\u2019t make you tell me Dan, but I want to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeath.\u201d Phil cocked his brow slightly as Dan continued. \u201cI\u2019m scared of death and of dying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh Dan,\u201d Phil calmly spoke, laying his hand on Dan\u2019s cheek gently. \u201cThat\u2019s not stupid. It\u2019s valid, you know. Death is scary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhil it basically paralyzes me. It - it entraps me with this fear of not knowing, and makes me question everything until it breaks me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s made to be broken, Dan.\u201d Tears brimmed Dan\u2019s eyes, and Phil pulled him close. \u201cWhat exactly scares you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot knowing if dying hurts, what comes after. What if it\u2019s just lights out, and darkness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring some glow sticks to the afterlife and we\u2019ll shine in the dark,\u201d Phil chuckled and wiped Dan\u2019s eyes. \u201cDan, it\u2019s scary. I know, trust me. But you have to believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn what? I\u2019m scared I\u2019ll die before accomplishing anything, that you\u2019ll die before me and leave me alone in the world, Phil.</p><p>\u201cLife Dan. You have to be willing to just believe that things are more than they seem. I promise we\u2019ll do everything you wish to do before we die. You\u2019ll accomplish everything you can dream of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhil, it\u2019s not that easy.\u201d</p><p>Phil sighed, threading his fingers through Dan\u2019s hair. \u201cI know it isn\u2019t that easy Dan; facing your fears never is. But you have to be able to try and fight on. For example, dandelions. A lot of people see them as weeds and no good. Others see them as this beautiful enchanting thing that has such meaning. Your life is like a dandelion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA flower?\u201d</p><p>Chuckling, Phil laid his head on top of Dan\u2019s. \u201cIt holds more worth than you see from your perspective, Dan. It\u2019ll be okay. Fears are scary, but you can overcome them. It just takes time, and I\u2019ll be there to help you. Even if it means holding your hand every step of the way.\u201d</p></p>",

It reminded him that somewhere, the truth lies and that one day he won&rsquo;t have to worry about what&rsquo;s to come.</p><p>&ldquo;Really? Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have you seen them? I don&rsquo;t trust them.&rdquo; Phil shrugged. &ldquo;They could kick you at any moment, and their faces .&rdquo; He shuddered. &ldquo;Their faces are the worst.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan cracked a smile, one that barely had any sort of feeling and was forced the entire way. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s weird Phil.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, but just because others see it as weird doesn&rsquo;t mean anything, Dan. Your fears still matter because you live with them, no matter how silly they seem. If someone is afraid of spiders you don&rsquo;t tell them it&rsquo;s silly, do you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No&hellip; I guess not. But what does tha-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then your own aren&rsquo;t silly either Dan.&rdquo; Phil interrupted him and sighed. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make you tell me Dan, but I want to help.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Death.&rdquo; Phil cocked his brow slightly as Dan continued. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared of death and of dying.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh Dan,&rdquo; Phil calmly spoke, laying his hand on Dan&rsquo;s cheek gently. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not stupid. It&rsquo;s valid, you know. Death is scary.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Phil it basically paralyzes me. It - it entraps me with this fear of not knowing, and makes me question everything until it breaks me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s made to be broken, Dan.&rdquo; Tears brimmed Dan&rsquo;s eyes, and Phil pulled him close. &ldquo;What exactly scares you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not knowing if dying hurts, what comes after. What if it&rsquo;s just lights out, and darkness?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring some glow sticks to the afterlife and we&rsquo;ll shine in the dark,&rdquo; Phil chuckled and wiped Dan&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Dan, it&rsquo;s scary. I know, trust me. But you have to believe.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In what? I&rsquo;m scared I&rsquo;ll die before accomplishing anything, that you&rsquo;ll die before me and leave me alone in the world, Phil.</p><p>&ldquo;Life Dan. You have to be willing to just believe that things are more than they seem. I promise we&rsquo;ll do everything you wish to do before we die. You&rsquo;ll accomplish everything you can dream of.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Phil, it&rsquo;s not that easy.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil sighed, threading his fingers through Dan&rsquo;s hair. &ldquo;I know it isn&rsquo;t that easy Dan; facing your fears never is. But you have to be able to try and fight on. For example, dandelions. A lot of people see them as weeds and no good. Others see them as this beautiful enchanting thing that has such meaning. Your life is like a dandelion.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A flower?&rdquo;</p><p>Chuckling, Phil laid his head on top of Dan&rsquo;s. &ldquo;It holds more worth than you see from your perspective, Dan. It&rsquo;ll be okay. Fears are scary, but you can overcome them. It just takes time, and I&rsquo;ll be there to help you. Even if it means holding your hand every step of the way.&rdquo;</p></p>",
