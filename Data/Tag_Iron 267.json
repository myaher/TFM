You could feel him staring and knew that he was seeping with impatience, but you remained unfazed as you continued to focus on the documents spread out on your desk- documents that he had forgotten to review and sign before the deadline, so you were doing it for him now.</p><p>\u201cYou could be a god and I could still ignore you,\u201d you said curtly, flipping to the next page.</p><p>\u201cYou- I- you can\u2019t talk to your boss like that,\u201d he stammered, somehow still surprised at your audacious remarks to him, even after several long months of this perpetual cycle.</p><p>\u201cSo fire me,\u201d you quipped as you closed the folder and tossed it on the desk.</p><p>You finally met his gaze and found him with his mouth ajar, finally unable to retort.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right, you can\u2019t,\u201d you continued, returning your eyes to the contents on your desk and opening up another file, \u201cbecause you can\u2019t run this company without me. You can barely make it through the biweekly board meeting without me. And can you imagine the headlines? <i><b>Tech Empire Ceo Superhero Billionaire Playboy Philanthropist Fires Assistant Because She Wouldn\u2019t Screw Him.</b></i> Not quite the image you want, especially after your little yacht incident.\u201d</p><p>Eight months ago, you were hired to fix the mess that Tony had made of his PR department after crashing his yacht into a cruise dock. He was sued by 13 out of the 20 supermodels that were with him, and charged for boating under the influence. Of course, he was able to buy his way out of all of it, but you really had your hands full scrubbing away all the media evidence and organizing a press tour to frame him in a slightly better light.</p><p>In two months, the event had been long forgotten by the world thanks to you and the team that you had led. At that time, he realized he could probably use a full-time assistant (manager\u2026 babysitter&hellip; ), so he offered you a position and a paygrade you couldn\u2019t refuse. It only took three weeks after that for him to start hitting on you, and since then you\u2019ve been doing all of the \u2018boring\u2019 parts of his work for him, while all he\u2019s done is flirt and pester you day in and day out.</p><p>\u201cCan we please stop bringing up the yacht thing? Everyone else has forgotten it, why can\u2019t we?\u201d Tony insisted, crossing his arms across his chest.</p><p>\u201cI can forget it, but I choose not to,\u201d you said, signing his signature across the bottom of an approval draft and then moving on to the next packet, \u201cThat event and the weeks that followed told me everything I need to know about you. Knowing those things help me do my job, the job that you hired me for.\u201d</p><p>They also helped you protect your heart from falling for him, but you certainly weren\u2019t going to tell him that.</p><p>\u201cOkay, but still,\u201d he pleaded, shoving his hands in his back pockets and leaning forward so that his waist was pressed against your desk, \u201cand I\u2019m not trying to screw you. You know that\u2019s not what I\u2019m asking\u2026\u201d</p><p>You signed the last document and closed the last folder, slipped the ones you needed to mail out into your bag, and clicked off the lamp on your desk, thrusting the room into a soft darkness illuminated only by the glow of the city below your office window.</p><p>\u201cThat is what you\u2019re asking, Mr. Stark,\u201d you stated, watching him cringe at your continuous refusal to simply call him Tony, \u201cMaybe not right now, not this very moment, but eventually, down the line, it\u2019s expected,\u201d you stated as you stood from your chair but stayed behind the desk, keeping the safe distance between the two of you, \u201cMaybe it starts with coffee, or wine, or dinner, but I\u2019ve seen enough of your past and cleaned up enough of your messes to know that that\u2019s what it always leads to with you. That\u2019s always what the question means. You\u2019ve just never had anyone tell you \u2018no\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Without another word you walked out of the office and left him standing in the darkness without a chance to respond.</p><p><br/></p><hr><p><br/></p><p>You headed down to your office early the next morning, coffee in hand and the conversation from the night before pushed completely out of your mind. You refused to develop feelings for him, so that meant that you could never linger on his offers or on the conversations that followed them. You couldn\u2019t beat yourself up for being a little harsher than necessary, or for ignoring the way your heart would flutter just the slightest bit when he\u2019d say your name. You wouldn\u2019t allow yourself to be just another number on the list of people he\u2019s slept with or another name in a headline about him.</p><p>And you\u2019d gotten good at avoiding him, limiting the amount of times you had to see him or the amount of opportunities he had to ask you out. When you were officially hired for the full-time position, he moved you into a room in his penthouse at the top of the tower, because it made the most sense for you to be onsite whenever he needed you, and for you to be just a few floors away from the offices and labs to avoid the city traffic everyday. At first, you worried that it would be a risk at worst or awkward at best, living just down the hall from him, but most mornings you were down in your office before he was even awake, and most nights he was down in the lab or the garage tinkering away at another project, leaving you to have the penthouse to yourself until late in the evenings.</p><p>But despite the facade that you wore so well, your resolve was slowly wearing down and you found yourself letting the butterflies linger a little longer than you\u2019d like, especially when he made little gestures that convinced you that he cared more than you were willing to believe.</p><p>Like now, when you walked into your office to find a massive bouquet of red roses sitting on the center of your desk.</p><p>You set your coffee and bag on the desk and inspected the gorgeous arrangement until you found a small gold envelope. You slipped the envelope from it\u2019s holder and opened it up to find a handwritten note on a little white piece of paper. You knew it was Tony\u2019s handwriting because you\u2019d learned to imitate it, and you were surprised he\u2019d taken the time to write this note himself.</p><p>\u201c<i>You\u2019re right - I can\u2019t do this without you. I\u2019m sorry.</i>\u201d</p><p>You slid the note back into the envelope and placed it in the top drawer of your desk before moving the flowers safely to one side of your desk. Before you could even sit down, your phone rang. You fished it out of your bag and saw Tony\u2019s name and photo lighting up your screen. It was odd for him to be up this early.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Mr. Stark,\u201d you said professionally as you answered the phone.</p><p>\u201cDid you get the flowers?\u201d he asked immediately, and you could tell he was trying to hide the pride and excitement in his voice.</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d you responded courteously, hoping to sound like you appreciated them without revealing just how impressed you were by them, \u201cThey\u2019re lovely. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat! I\u2019m in the gym, should be done in twenty. Let\u2019s meet in an hour to discuss the project proposals that came in last week. I looked over two of them this morning that I think look promising. I\u2019ll come to you,\u201d he said, and before you could even process what he had said, he ended the call.</p><p>Tony was rarely out of bed at this hour, so for him to be in the gym and not complaining about it so early was shocking enough. But for him to be aware of a task that needed to be done and ahead of it before you even gave him the first reminder was unbelievable. You had braced yourself for whatever flirty comment you knew would come with those flowers, but instead he was all business.</p><p>The meeting went by as remarkably as the call did. He was as polite and as friendly as ever, but there wasn\u2019t even a hint of flirtation or intention behind any of his words. He focused on the tasks and was prepared to ask and answer questions about the proposals, and even signed them himself without complaining. You kept waiting for a quip or an unprofessional comment, but none ever came.</p><p>You spent the rest of the day in the same state of pleasant surprise as every meeting and task went by timely and successfully, and by the end of the day you were both ahead of schedule and your to-do list was completely cleared. You had actually managed to get off work on time. You returned to your office to collect your things. You were straightening up the files on your desk for tomorrow when Tony appeared in your doorway. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cGot any plans tonight?\u201d he asked casually, fiddling with a Newton\u2019s Cradle figure on your desk.</p><p><i>Didn\u2019t even last a day</i>, you thought, assuming he was asking so he could ask you out again.</p><p>\u201cYes, actually,\u201d you said as you stored the last file in the organizer and grabbed your bag, \u201cI think I\u2019m going to go see a movie with Wanda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood! You should go have some fun,\u201d he said with a soft smile.</p><p><i>Well that was unexpected.</i></p><p>You were too dumbfounded to really say anything, so you just stammered something similar to a \u201cyeah\u201d as you tried to carry both your bag and vase of flowers around your desk towards the door.</p><p>\u201cHere, I\u2019ll take these up for you,\u201d Tony offered, carefully taking the bouquet from your hands, \u201cI\u2019ll leave them on the counter in the kitchen.</p><p>The two of you silently walked together to the two elevators at the end of the hall, and he pressed both the up and down buttons. When your elevator arrived to take you to the garage, he simply told you to have a good night. Once the elevator doors closed you leaned against the sidewall, still trying to process what in the world had happened.</p><p>You felt like you were living in some alternate universe were Tony didn\u2019t incessantly hit on you or never got any work done. You half expected to wake up the next day and everything be back to normal, as if it was just a fluke or a weird dream, but that wasn\u2019t the case. For the next ten weeks, Tony was a powerhouse of productivity. He was in the gym every morning before you had even made your coffee, he attended every meeting punctually, and he was constantly engaged and involved in the current projects. He was even using his own office more, for actual work and not just for storage of random project drafts.</p><p>He also hadn\u2019t flirted with you, hit on you, or made even the slightest attempt to ask you out. It made your job a million times easier, and you actually enjoyed being able to interact with him closely without fear of overstepping professional boundaries. And while a small part of you missed the little flirty comments and the way they made you feel despite you always pretending like you loathed them, you were ultimately happy with the progress in your strictly professional relationship with Tony, and the risk of developing deeper feelings for him was long behind you.</p><p>Or so you thought, until you walked into his office to find him with a gorgeous blonde who you had never seen before.</p><p>They weren\u2019t doing anything, just sitting across from each other on either side of Tony\u2019s desk, but she was stunning and he was smiling, and for some reason, that bothered you.</p><p>\u201cSorry to interrupt, I didn\u2019t know you were with anyone,\u201d you said, keeping a perfect posture as you stood in the doorway, \u201cwe have a briefing meeting with the new project team in an hour and I wanted to go over the itinerary. But I\u2019ll just email it to you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, it\u2019s fine, I was just leaving,\u201d the bombshell said with a dazzling smile as she rose from her chair.</p><p>Tony stood and walked around the desk to meet her, shaking her hand as they whispered exchanges through flirty smiles. Her heels clacked on the concrete floor as she sauntered past you, and you tried to bury the feeling that was bubbling up inside you. Was it\u2026 jealousy? It couldn\u2019t be. You\u2019d never truly envied another woman, and you didn\u2019t have feelings for Tony. So why would you care, now?</p><p>You\u2019d been staring at your own feet while you tried to process this and lost yourself in your train of thought until you finally registered Tony calling your name.</p><p>\u201cEarth to Y/N,\u201d he laughed.</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry. Yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe itinerary?\u201d</p><p>He was leaning back against the front of his desk, one hand in his pocket and the other extended, waiting for you to bring him the document. You strode forward, trying to clear your head and control your expression so that you wouldn\u2019t give yourself away, but it was easier said than done once you were close enough to him to smell his cologne.</p><p>\u201cYou smell nice,\u201d you commented without thinking as you handed him the paper.</p><p>You saw him smirk at your compliment, but before he could respond you immediately began a run through of the meeting order, hoping you could distract him long enough that he would forget and so that you could regain your own composure.</p><p>Luckily, he seemed to let it go and you were able to push down those feelings long enough to get to the meeting and through the rest of the day. But after work you spent the whole night tossing and turning in bed, wondering just exactly why you had felt that way&hellip; why seeing him with this beautiful stranger in his office with her sitting in the seat you usually sat in would bother you so much.</p><p><br/></p><hr><p><br/></p><p>You only got a few hours of sleep, but when you woke up the next morning you were determined to renounce any feelings you could have for Tony. You realized that even though he hadn\u2019t flirted with you in over two months, you had gotten comfortable with him, and you had begun to let your own guard down- something you swore you\u2019d never do when you took this job. </p><p>You figured that it would be easy to get back on track, especially since he had been respecting your professional relationship, and it would be even easier if he did suddenly have a girlfriend (once you could truly get over your feelings of jealousy and not just ignore them).</p><p>And it was easy, for most of that day, but only because you hadn\u2019t seen him. He had sent you a text after the gym saying he was heading down to the lab to work out some kinks in the latest project, and you hadn\u2019t heard from him since.</p><p>Your work flew by as you made the last minute preparations and confirmed the orders for the formal party that Tony was hosting Saturday evening. It had been scheduled months ago and you did all of the planning and made all of the orders immediately, so you only had a few small details left to finalize. </p><p>You finished your work for the day and had just made a mental note to remind Tony of the event (since it was something that had been scheduled long before he had re-invested himself in the company) when you heard a knock on your office door.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Tony smirked as he strut into your office. His Black Sabbath t-shirt had a small rip near his ribs and there were grease marks on his face and neck.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the world have you been working on,\u201d you laughed, taking in his disheveled appearance.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s classified,\u201d he winked.</p><p>You rolled your eyes, trying to appear once again unfazed but unable to fully ignore the butterflies that fluttered at that wink and smirk.</p><p>\u201cProject 48,\u201d he said, giving you an actual answer, \u201cbut that\u2019s not important. I have a party on Saturday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I planned it,\u201d you stated as you put away your last folders.</p><p>\u201cYes, but I- thank you, for doing that by the way-,\u201d he said quickly and almost nervously, \u201cbut I want you to come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured I was already invited, since I planned the whole event, and it\u2019s in the penthouse which I also live in, so\u2026\u201d you laughed, not understanding what he meant.</p><p>\u201cNo, I want you to come with me,\u201d he rephrased with a bit of hesitation, \u201cas my date.\u201d</p><p>Your world froze and your mind flooded with a thousand thoughts and questions.<i> Why was he asking you out now after months of not even one flirtatious comment? Why wasn\u2019t he asking the blonde from yesterday? Why are you so relieved that he\u2019s asking you, instead? Why do you want to say yes? You have to say no, right? You have to say no.</i></p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, I already have a date,\u201d you blurted out before realizing that it wasn\u2019t true at all but was simply the best way of saying \u2018no\u2019 that your mind could come up with on the spot. </p><p>\u201cYou do? <i>Who</i>?\u201d he asked, clearly not expecting that answer.</p><p>\u201cSteve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRogers? Really?\u201d</p><p>Tony almost seemed offended at this point, but he eventually just said okay and apologized for asking. Before you could say anything else, he turned around and walked out of your office. You hung your head in your hands with your elbows on your desk, cursing yourself for all the emotions you were feeling and wondering what was worse- the fact that he asked you out for the millionth time or the fact that you denied him yet again.</p><p>You picked up your phone from off your desk and swiped across the screen to unlock it, sighing when you were greeted with the photo you had just set as your wallpaper a week before- a photo that Bruce had taken of you and Tony goofing off in the lab, each of you wearing half of one of the suits Tony had been working on.</p><p>You quickly opened the text message application to avoid looking at the picture any longer, and sent Steve a text. \u201c<i>Please tell me you don\u2019t have a date for Saturday</i>.\u201d <br/></p><hr><p><a

You could feel him staring and knew that he was seeping with impatience, but you remained unfazed as you continued to focus on the documents spread out on your desk- documents that he had forgotten to review and sign before the deadline, so you were doing it for him now.</p><p>\u201cYou could be a god and I could still ignore you,\u201d you said curtly, flipping to the next page.</p><p>\u201cYou- I- you can\u2019t talk to your boss like that,\u201d he stammered, somehow still surprised at your audacious remarks to him, even after several long months of this perpetual cycle.</p><p>\u201cSo fire me,\u201d you quipped as you closed the folder and tossed it on the desk.</p><p>You finally met his gaze and found him with his mouth ajar, finally unable to retort.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right, you can\u2019t,\u201d you continued, returning your eyes to the contents on your desk and opening up another file, \u201cbecause you can\u2019t run this company without me. You can barely make it through the biweekly board meeting without me. And can you imagine the headlines? <i><b>Tech Empire Ceo Superhero Billionaire Playboy Philanthropist Fires Assistant Because She Wouldn\u2019t Screw Him.</b></i> Not quite the image you want, especially after your little yacht incident.\u201d</p><p>Eight months ago, you were hired to fix the mess that Tony had made of his PR department after crashing his yacht into a cruise dock. He was sued by 13 out of the 20 supermodels that were with him, and charged for boating under the influence. Of course, he was able to buy his way out of all of it, but you really had your hands full scrubbing away all the media evidence and organizing a press tour to frame him in a slightly better light.</p><p>In two months, the event had been long forgotten by the world thanks to you and the team that you had led. At that time, he realized he could probably use a full-time assistant (manager\u2026 babysitter\u2026 ), so he offered you a position and a paygrade you couldn\u2019t refuse. It only took three weeks after that for him to start hitting on you, and since then you\u2019ve been doing all of the \u2018boring\u2019 parts of his work for him, while all he\u2019s done is flirt and pester you day in and day out.</p><p>\u201cCan we please stop bringing up the yacht thing? Everyone else has forgotten it, why can\u2019t we?\u201d Tony insisted, crossing his arms across his chest.</p><p>\u201cI can forget it, but I choose not to,\u201d you said, signing his signature across the bottom of an approval draft and then moving on to the next packet, \u201cThat event and the weeks that followed told me everything I need to know about you. Knowing those things help me do my job, the job that you hired me for.\u201d</p><p>They also helped you protect your heart from falling for him, but you certainly weren\u2019t going to tell him that.</p><p>\u201cOkay, but still,\u201d he pleaded, shoving his hands in his back pockets and leaning forward so that his waist was pressed against your desk, \u201cand I\u2019m not trying to screw you. You know that\u2019s not what I\u2019m asking\u2026\u201d</p><p>You signed the last document and closed the last folder, slipped the ones you needed to mail out into your bag, and clicked off the lamp on your desk, thrusting the room into a soft darkness illuminated only by the glow of the city below your office window.</p><p>\u201cThat is what you\u2019re asking, Mr. Stark,\u201d you stated, watching him cringe at your continuous refusal to simply call him Tony, \u201cMaybe not right now, not this very moment, but eventually, down the line, it\u2019s expected,\u201d you stated as you stood from your chair but stayed behind the desk, keeping the safe distance between the two of you, \u201cMaybe it starts with coffee, or wine, or dinner, but I\u2019ve seen enough of your past and cleaned up enough of your messes to know that that\u2019s what it always leads to with you. That\u2019s always what the question means. You\u2019ve just never had anyone tell you \u2018no\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Without another word you walked out of the office and left him standing in the darkness without a chance to respond.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>You headed down to your office early the next morning, coffee in hand and the conversation from the night before pushed completely out of your mind. You refused to develop feelings for him, so that meant that you could never linger on his offers or on the conversations that followed them. You couldn\u2019t beat yourself up for being a little harsher than necessary, or for ignoring the way your heart would flutter just the slightest bit when he\u2019d say your name. You wouldn\u2019t allow yourself to be just another number on the list of people he\u2019s slept with or another name in a headline about him.</p><p>And you\u2019d gotten good at avoiding him, limiting the amount of times you had to see him or the amount of opportunities he had to ask you out. When you were officially hired for the full-time position, he moved you into a room in his penthouse at the top of the tower, because it made the most sense for you to be onsite whenever he needed you, and for you to be just a few floors away from the offices and labs to avoid the city traffic everyday. At first, you worried that it would be a risk at worst or awkward at best, living just down the hall from him, but most mornings you were down in your office before he was even awake, and most nights he was down in the lab or the garage tinkering away at another project, leaving you to have the penthouse to yourself until late in the evenings.</p><p>But despite the facade that you wore so well, your resolve was slowly wearing down and you found yourself letting the butterflies linger a little longer than you\u2019d like, especially when he made little gestures that convinced you that he cared more than you were willing to believe.</p><p>Like now, when you walked into your office to find a massive bouquet of red roses sitting on the center of your desk.</p><p>You set your coffee and bag on the desk and inspected the gorgeous arrangement until you found a small gold envelope. You slipped the envelope from it\u2019s holder and opened it up to find a handwritten note on a little white piece of paper. You knew it was Tony\u2019s handwriting because you\u2019d learned to imitate it, and you were surprised he\u2019d taken the time to write this note himself.</p><p>\u201c<i>You\u2019re right - I can\u2019t do this without you. I\u2019m sorry.</i>\u201d</p><p>You slid the note back into the envelope and placed it in the top drawer of your desk before moving the flowers safely to one side of your desk. Before you could even sit down, your phone rang. You fished it out of your bag and saw Tony\u2019s name and photo lighting up your screen. It was odd for him to be up this early.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Mr. Stark,\u201d you said professionally as you answered the phone.</p><p>\u201cDid you get the flowers?\u201d he asked immediately, and you could tell he was trying to hide the pride and excitement in his voice.</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d you responded courteously, hoping to sound like you appreciated them without revealing just how impressed you were by them, \u201cThey\u2019re lovely. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat! I\u2019m in the gym, should be done in twenty. Let\u2019s meet in an hour to discuss the project proposals that came in last week. I looked over two of them this morning that I think look promising. I\u2019ll come to you,\u201d he said, and before you could even process what he had said, he ended the call.</p><p>Tony was rarely out of bed at this hour, so for him to be in the gym and not complaining about it so early was shocking enough. But for him to be aware of a task that needed to be done and ahead of it before you even gave him the first reminder was unbelievable. You had braced yourself for whatever flirty comment you knew would come with those flowers, but instead he was all business.</p><p>The meeting went by as remarkably as the call did. He was as polite and as friendly as ever, but there wasn\u2019t even a hint of flirtation or intention behind any of his words. He focused on the tasks and was prepared to ask and answer questions about the proposals, and even signed them himself without complaining. You kept waiting for a quip or an unprofessional comment, but none ever came.</p><p>You spent the rest of the day in the same state of pleasant surprise as every meeting and task went by timely and successfully, and by the end of the day you were both ahead of schedule and your to-do list was completely cleared. You had actually managed to get off work on time. You returned to your office to collect your things. You were straightening up the files on your desk for tomorrow when Tony appeared in your doorway. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cGot any plans tonight?\u201d he asked casually, fiddling with a Newton\u2019s Cradle figure on your desk.</p><p><i>Didn\u2019t even last a day</i>, you thought, assuming he was asking so he could ask you out again.</p><p>\u201cYes, actually,\u201d you said as you stored the last file in the organizer and grabbed your bag, \u201cI think I\u2019m going to go see a movie with Wanda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood! You should go have some fun,\u201d he said with a soft smile.</p><p><i>Well that was unexpected.</i></p><p>You were too dumbfounded to really say anything, so you just stammered something similar to a \u201cyeah\u201d as you tried to carry both your bag and vase of flowers around your desk towards the door.</p><p>\u201cHere, I\u2019ll take these up for you,\u201d Tony offered, carefully taking the bouquet from your hands, \u201cI\u2019ll leave them on the counter in the kitchen.</p><p>The two of you silently walked together to the two elevators at the end of the hall, and he pressed both the up and down buttons. When your elevator arrived to take you to the garage, he simply told you to have a good night. Once the elevator doors closed you leaned against the sidewall, still trying to process what in the world had happened.</p><p>You felt like you were living in some alternate universe were Tony didn\u2019t incessantly hit on you or never got any work done. You half expected to wake up the next day and everything be back to normal, as if it was just a fluke or a weird dream, but that wasn\u2019t the case. For the next ten weeks, Tony was a powerhouse of productivity. He was in the gym every morning before you had even made your coffee, he attended every meeting punctually, and he was constantly engaged and involved in the current projects. He was even using his own office more, for actual work and not just for storage of random project drafts.</p><p>He also hadn\u2019t flirted with you, hit on you, or made even the slightest attempt to ask you out. It made your job a million times easier, and you actually enjoyed being able to interact with him closely without fear of overstepping professional boundaries. And while a small part of you missed the little flirty comments and the way they made you feel despite you always pretending like you loathed them, you were ultimately happy with the progress in your strictly professional relationship with Tony, and the risk of developing deeper feelings for him was long behind you.</p><p>Or so you thought, until you walked into his office to find him with a gorgeous blonde who you had never seen before.</p><p>They weren\u2019t doing anything, just sitting across from each other on either side of Tony\u2019s desk, but she was stunning and he was smiling, and for some reason, that bothered you.</p><p>\u201cSorry to interrupt, I didn\u2019t know you were with anyone,\u201d you said, keeping a perfect posture as you stood in the doorway, \u201cwe have a briefing meeting with the new project team in an hour and I wanted to go over the itinerary. But I\u2019ll just email it to you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, it\u2019s fine, I was just leaving,\u201d the bombshell said with a dazzling smile as she rose from her chair.</p><p>Tony stood and walked around the desk to meet her, shaking her hand as they whispered exchanges through flirty smiles. Her heels clacked on the concrete floor as she sauntered past you, and you tried to bury the feeling that was bubbling up inside you. Was it\u2026 jealousy? It couldn\u2019t be. You\u2019d never truly envied another woman, and you didn\u2019t have feelings for Tony. So why would you care, now?</p><p>You\u2019d been staring at your own feet while you tried to process this and lost yourself in your train of thought until you finally registered Tony calling your name.</p><p>\u201cEarth to Y/N,\u201d he laughed.</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry. Yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe itinerary?\u201d</p><p>He was leaning back against the front of his desk, one hand in his pocket and the other extended, waiting for you to bring him the document. You strode forward, trying to clear your head and control your expression so that you wouldn\u2019t give yourself away, but it was easier said than done once you were close enough to him to smell his cologne.</p><p>\u201cYou smell nice,\u201d you commented without thinking as you handed him the paper.</p><p>You saw him smirk at your compliment, but before he could respond you immediately began a run through of the meeting order, hoping you could distract him long enough that he would forget and so that you could regain your own composure.</p><p>Luckily, he seemed to let it go and you were able to push down those feelings long enough to get to the meeting and through the rest of the day. But after work you spent the whole night tossing and turning in bed, wondering just exactly why you had felt that way\u2026 why seeing him with this beautiful stranger in his office with her sitting in the seat you usually sat in would bother you so much.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>You only got a few hours of sleep, but when you woke up the next morning you were determined to renounce any feelings you could have for Tony. You realized that even though he hadn\u2019t flirted with you in over two months, you had gotten comfortable with him, and you had begun to let your own guard down- something you swore you\u2019d never do when you took this job. </p><p>You figured that it would be easy to get back on track, especially since he had been respecting your professional relationship, and it would be even easier if he did suddenly have a girlfriend (once you could truly get over your feelings of jealousy and not just ignore them).</p><p>And it was easy, for most of that day, but only because you hadn\u2019t seen him. He had sent you a text after the gym saying he was heading down to the lab to work out some kinks in the latest project, and you hadn\u2019t heard from him since.</p><p>Your work flew by as you made the last minute preparations and confirmed the orders for the formal party that Tony was hosting Saturday evening. It had been scheduled months ago and you did all of the planning and made all of the orders immediately, so you only had a few small details left to finalize. </p><p>You finished your work for the day and had just made a mental note to remind Tony of the event (since it was something that had been scheduled long before he had re-invested himself in the company) when you heard a knock on your office door.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Tony smirked as he strut into your office. His Black Sabbath t-shirt had a small rip near his ribs and there were grease marks on his face and neck.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the world have you been working on,\u201d you laughed, taking in his disheveled appearance.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s classified,\u201d he winked.</p><p>You rolled your eyes, trying to appear once again unfazed but unable to fully ignore the butterflies that fluttered at that wink and smirk.</p><p>\u201cProject 48,\u201d he said, giving you an actual answer, \u201cbut that\u2019s not important. I have a party on Saturday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I planned it,\u201d you stated as you put away your last folders.</p><p>\u201cYes, but I- thank you, for doing that by the way-,\u201d he said quickly and almost nervously, \u201cbut I want you to come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured I was already invited, since I planned the whole event, and it\u2019s in the penthouse which I also live in, so\u2026\u201d you laughed, not understanding what he meant.</p><p>\u201cNo, I want you to come with me,\u201d he rephrased with a bit of hesitation, \u201cas my date.\u201d</p><p>Your world froze and your mind flooded with a thousand thoughts and questions.<i> Why was he asking you out now after months of not even one flirtatious comment? Why wasn\u2019t he asking the blonde from yesterday? Why are you so relieved that he\u2019s asking you, instead? Why do you want to say yes? You have to say no, right? You have to say no.</i></p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, I already have a date,\u201d you blurted out before realizing that it wasn\u2019t true at all but was simply the best way of saying \u2018no\u2019 that your mind could come up with on the spot. </p><p>\u201cYou do? <i>Who</i>?\u201d he asked, clearly not expecting that answer.</p><p>\u201cSteve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRogers? Really?\u201d</p><p>Tony almost seemed offended at this point, but he eventually just said okay and apologized for asking. Before you could say anything else, he turned around and walked out of your office. You hung your head in your hands with your elbows on your desk, cursing yourself for all the emotions you were feeling and wondering what was worse- the fact that he asked you out for the millionth time or the fact that you denied him yet again.</p><p>You picked up your phone from off your desk and swiped across the screen to unlock it, sighing when you were greeted with the photo you had just set as your wallpaper a week before- a photo that Bruce had taken of you and Tony goofing off in the lab, each of you wearing half of one of the suits Tony had been working on.</p><p>You quickly opened the text message application to avoid looking at the picture any longer, and sent Steve a text. \u201c<i>Please tell me you don\u2019t have a date for Saturday</i>.\u201d <br></p><hr><p><a

You could feel him staring and knew that he was seeping with impatience, but you remained unfazed as you continued to focus on the documents spread out on your desk- documents that he had forgotten to review and sign before the deadline, so you were doing it for him now.</p><p>\u201cYou could be a god and I could still ignore you,\u201d you said curtly, flipping to the next page.</p><p>\u201cYou- I- you can\u2019t talk to your boss like that,\u201d he stammered, somehow still surprised at your audacious remarks to him, even after several long months of this perpetual cycle.</p><p>\u201cSo fire me,\u201d you quipped as you closed the folder and tossed it on the desk.</p><p>You finally met his gaze and found him with his mouth ajar, finally unable to retort.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right, you can\u2019t,\u201d you continued, returning your eyes to the contents on your desk and opening up another file, \u201cbecause you can\u2019t run this company without me. You can barely make it through the biweekly board meeting without me. And can you imagine the headlines? <i><b>Tech Empire Ceo Superhero Billionaire Playboy Philanthropist Fires Assistant Because She Wouldn\u2019t Screw Him.</b></i> Not quite the image you want, especially after your little yacht incident.\u201d</p><p>Eight months ago, you were hired to fix the mess that Tony had made of his PR department after crashing his yacht into a cruise dock. He was sued by 13 out of the 20 supermodels that were with him, and charged for boating under the influence. Of course, he was able to buy his way out of all of it, but you really had your hands full scrubbing away all the media evidence and organizing a press tour to frame him in a slightly better light.</p><p>In two months, the event had been long forgotten by the world thanks to you and the team that you had led. At that time, he realized he could probably use a full-time assistant (manager\u2026 babysitter\u2026 ), so he offered you a position and a paygrade you couldn\u2019t refuse. It only took three weeks after that for him to start hitting on you, and since then you\u2019ve been doing all of the \u2018boring\u2019 parts of his work for him, while all he\u2019s done is flirt and pester you day in and day out.</p><p>\u201cCan we please stop bringing up the yacht thing? Everyone else has forgotten it, why can\u2019t we?\u201d Tony insisted, crossing his arms across his chest.</p><p>\u201cI can forget it, but I choose not to,\u201d you said, signing his signature across the bottom of an approval draft and then moving on to the next packet, \u201cThat event and the weeks that followed told me everything I need to know about you. Knowing those things help me do my job, the job that you hired me for.\u201d</p><p>They also helped you protect your heart from falling for him, but you certainly weren\u2019t going to tell him that.</p><p>\u201cOkay, but still,\u201d he pleaded, shoving his hands in his back pockets and leaning forward so that his waist was pressed against your desk, \u201cand I\u2019m not trying to screw you. You know that\u2019s not what I\u2019m asking\u2026\u201d</p><p>You signed the last document and closed the last folder, slipped the ones you needed to mail out into your bag, and clicked off the lamp on your desk, thrusting the room into a soft darkness illuminated only by the glow of the city below your office window.</p><p>\u201cThat is what you\u2019re asking, Mr. Stark,\u201d you stated, watching him cringe at your continuous refusal to simply call him Tony, \u201cMaybe not right now, not this very moment, but eventually, down the line, it\u2019s expected,\u201d you stated as you stood from your chair but stayed behind the desk, keeping the safe distance between the two of you, \u201cMaybe it starts with coffee, or wine, or dinner, but I\u2019ve seen enough of your past and cleaned up enough of your messes to know that that\u2019s what it always leads to with you. That\u2019s always what the question means. You\u2019ve just never had anyone tell you \u2018no\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Without another word you walked out of the office and left him standing in the darkness without a chance to respond.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>You headed down to your office early the next morning, coffee in hand and the conversation from the night before pushed completely out of your mind. You refused to develop feelings for him, so that meant that you could never linger on his offers or on the conversations that followed them. You couldn\u2019t beat yourself up for being a little harsher than necessary, or for ignoring the way your heart would flutter just the slightest bit when he\u2019d say your name. You wouldn\u2019t allow yourself to be just another number on the list of people he\u2019s slept with or another name in a headline about him.</p><p>And you\u2019d gotten good at avoiding him, limiting the amount of times you had to see him or the amount of opportunities he had to ask you out. When you were officially hired for the full-time position, he moved you into a room in his penthouse at the top of the tower, because it made the most sense for you to be onsite whenever he needed you, and for you to be just a few floors away from the offices and labs to avoid the city traffic everyday. At first, you worried that it would be a risk at worst or awkward at best, living just down the hall from him, but most mornings you were down in your office before he was even awake, and most nights he was down in the lab or the garage tinkering away at another project, leaving you to have the penthouse to yourself until late in the evenings.</p><p>But despite the facade that you wore so well, your resolve was slowly wearing down and you found yourself letting the butterflies linger a little longer than you\u2019d like, especially when he made little gestures that convinced you that he cared more than you were willing to believe.</p><p>Like now, when you walked into your office to find a massive bouquet of red roses sitting on the center of your desk.</p><p>You set your coffee and bag on the desk and inspected the gorgeous arrangement until you found a small gold envelope. You slipped the envelope from it\u2019s holder and opened it up to find a handwritten note on a little white piece of paper. You knew it was Tony\u2019s handwriting because you\u2019d learned to imitate it, and you were surprised he\u2019d taken the time to write this note himself.</p><p>\u201c<i>You\u2019re right - I can\u2019t do this without you. I\u2019m sorry.</i>\u201d</p><p>You slid the note back into the envelope and placed it in the top drawer of your desk before moving the flowers safely to one side of your desk. Before you could even sit down, your phone rang. You fished it out of your bag and saw Tony\u2019s name and photo lighting up your screen. It was odd for him to be up this early.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Mr. Stark,\u201d you said professionally as you answered the phone.</p><p>\u201cDid you get the flowers?\u201d he asked immediately, and you could tell he was trying to hide the pride and excitement in his voice.</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d you responded courteously, hoping to sound like you appreciated them without revealing just how impressed you were by them, \u201cThey\u2019re lovely. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat! I\u2019m in the gym, should be done in twenty. Let\u2019s meet in an hour to discuss the project proposals that came in last week. I looked over two of them this morning that I think look promising. I\u2019ll come to you,\u201d he said, and before you could even process what he had said, he ended the call.</p><p>Tony was rarely out of bed at this hour, so for him to be in the gym and not complaining about it so early was shocking enough. But for him to be aware of a task that needed to be done and ahead of it before you even gave him the first reminder was unbelievable. You had braced yourself for whatever flirty comment you knew would come with those flowers, but instead he was all business.</p><p>The meeting went by as remarkably as the call did. He was as polite and as friendly as ever, but there wasn\u2019t even a hint of flirtation or intention behind any of his words. He focused on the tasks and was prepared to ask and answer questions about the proposals, and even signed them himself without complaining. You kept waiting for a quip or an unprofessional comment, but none ever came.</p><p>You spent the rest of the day in the same state of pleasant surprise as every meeting and task went by timely and successfully, and by the end of the day you were both ahead of schedule and your to-do list was completely cleared. You had actually managed to get off work on time. You returned to your office to collect your things. You were straightening up the files on your desk for tomorrow when Tony appeared in your doorway. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cGot any plans tonight?\u201d he asked casually, fiddling with a Newton\u2019s Cradle figure on your desk.</p><p><i>Didn\u2019t even last a day</i>, you thought, assuming he was asking so he could ask you out again.</p><p>\u201cYes, actually,\u201d you said as you stored the last file in the organizer and grabbed your bag, \u201cI think I\u2019m going to go see a movie with Wanda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood! You should go have some fun,\u201d he said with a soft smile.</p><p><i>Well that was unexpected.</i></p><p>You were too dumbfounded to really say anything, so you just stammered something similar to a \u201cyeah\u201d as you tried to carry both your bag and vase of flowers around your desk towards the door.</p><p>\u201cHere, I\u2019ll take these up for you,\u201d Tony offered, carefully taking the bouquet from your hands, \u201cI\u2019ll leave them on the counter in the kitchen.</p><p>The two of you silently walked together to the two elevators at the end of the hall, and he pressed both the up and down buttons. When your elevator arrived to take you to the garage, he simply told you to have a good night. Once the elevator doors closed you leaned against the sidewall, still trying to process what in the world had happened.</p><p>You felt like you were living in some alternate universe were Tony didn\u2019t incessantly hit on you or never got any work done. You half expected to wake up the next day and everything be back to normal, as if it was just a fluke or a weird dream, but that wasn\u2019t the case. For the next ten weeks, Tony was a powerhouse of productivity. He was in the gym every morning before you had even made your coffee, he attended every meeting punctually, and he was constantly engaged and involved in the current projects. He was even using his own office more, for actual work and not just for storage of random project drafts.</p><p>He also hadn\u2019t flirted with you, hit on you, or made even the slightest attempt to ask you out. It made your job a million times easier, and you actually enjoyed being able to interact with him closely without fear of overstepping professional boundaries. And while a small part of you missed the little flirty comments and the way they made you feel despite you always pretending like you loathed them, you were ultimately happy with the progress in your strictly professional relationship with Tony, and the risk of developing deeper feelings for him was long behind you.</p><p>Or so you thought, until you walked into his office to find him with a gorgeous blonde who you had never seen before.</p><p>They weren\u2019t doing anything, just sitting across from each other on either side of Tony\u2019s desk, but she was stunning and he was smiling, and for some reason, that bothered you.</p><p>\u201cSorry to interrupt, I didn\u2019t know you were with anyone,\u201d you said, keeping a perfect posture as you stood in the doorway, \u201cwe have a briefing meeting with the new project team in an hour and I wanted to go over the itinerary. But I\u2019ll just email it to you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, it\u2019s fine, I was just leaving,\u201d the bombshell said with a dazzling smile as she rose from her chair.</p><p>Tony stood and walked around the desk to meet her, shaking her hand as they whispered exchanges through flirty smiles. Her heels clacked on the concrete floor as she sauntered past you, and you tried to bury the feeling that was bubbling up inside you. Was it\u2026 jealousy? It couldn\u2019t be. You\u2019d never truly envied another woman, and you didn\u2019t have feelings for Tony. So why would you care, now?</p><p>You\u2019d been staring at your own feet while you tried to process this and lost yourself in your train of thought until you finally registered Tony calling your name.</p><p>\u201cEarth to Y/N,\u201d he laughed.</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry. Yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe itinerary?\u201d</p><p>He was leaning back against the front of his desk, one hand in his pocket and the other extended, waiting for you to bring him the document. You strode forward, trying to clear your head and control your expression so that you wouldn\u2019t give yourself away, but it was easier said than done once you were close enough to him to smell his cologne.</p><p>\u201cYou smell nice,\u201d you commented without thinking as you handed him the paper.</p><p>You saw him smirk at your compliment, but before he could respond you immediately began a run through of the meeting order, hoping you could distract him long enough that he would forget and so that you could regain your own composure.</p><p>Luckily, he seemed to let it go and you were able to push down those feelings long enough to get to the meeting and through the rest of the day. But after work you spent the whole night tossing and turning in bed, wondering just exactly why you had felt that way\u2026 why seeing him with this beautiful stranger in his office with her sitting in the seat you usually sat in would bother you so much.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>You only got a few hours of sleep, but when you woke up the next morning you were determined to renounce any feelings you could have for Tony. You realized that even though he hadn\u2019t flirted with you in over two months, you had gotten comfortable with him, and you had begun to let your own guard down- something you swore you\u2019d never do when you took this job. </p><p>You figured that it would be easy to get back on track, especially since he had been respecting your professional relationship, and it would be even easier if he did suddenly have a girlfriend (once you could truly get over your feelings of jealousy and not just ignore them).</p><p>And it was easy, for most of that day, but only because you hadn\u2019t seen him. He had sent you a text after the gym saying he was heading down to the lab to work out some kinks in the latest project, and you hadn\u2019t heard from him since.</p><p>Your work flew by as you made the last minute preparations and confirmed the orders for the formal party that Tony was hosting Saturday evening. It had been scheduled months ago and you did all of the planning and made all of the orders immediately, so you only had a few small details left to finalize. </p><p>You finished your work for the day and had just made a mental note to remind Tony of the event (since it was something that had been scheduled long before he had re-invested himself in the company) when you heard a knock on your office door.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Tony smirked as he strut into your office. His Black Sabbath t-shirt had a small rip near his ribs and there were grease marks on his face and neck.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the world have you been working on,\u201d you laughed, taking in his disheveled appearance.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s classified,\u201d he winked.</p><p>You rolled your eyes, trying to appear once again unfazed but unable to fully ignore the butterflies that fluttered at that wink and smirk.</p><p>\u201cProject 48,\u201d he said, giving you an actual answer, \u201cbut that\u2019s not important. I have a party on Saturday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I planned it,\u201d you stated as you put away your last folders.</p><p>\u201cYes, but I- thank you, for doing that by the way-,\u201d he said quickly and almost nervously, \u201cbut I want you to come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured I was already invited, since I planned the whole event, and it\u2019s in the penthouse which I also live in, so\u2026\u201d you laughed, not understanding what he meant.</p><p>\u201cNo, I want you to come with me,\u201d he rephrased with a bit of hesitation, \u201cas my date.\u201d</p><p>Your world froze and your mind flooded with a thousand thoughts and questions.<i> Why was he asking you out now after months of not even one flirtatious comment? Why wasn\u2019t he asking the blonde from yesterday? Why are you so relieved that he\u2019s asking you, instead? Why do you want to say yes? You have to say no, right? You have to say no.</i></p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, I already have a date,\u201d you blurted out before realizing that it wasn\u2019t true at all but was simply the best way of saying \u2018no\u2019 that your mind could come up with on the spot. </p><p>\u201cYou do? <i>Who</i>?\u201d he asked, clearly not expecting that answer.</p><p>\u201cSteve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRogers? Really?\u201d</p><p>Tony almost seemed offended at this point, but he eventually just said okay and apologized for asking. Before you could say anything else, he turned around and walked out of your office. You hung your head in your hands with your elbows on your desk, cursing yourself for all the emotions you were feeling and wondering what was worse- the fact that he asked you out for the millionth time or the fact that you denied him yet again.</p><p>You picked up your phone from off your desk and swiped across the screen to unlock it, sighing when you were greeted with the photo you had just set as your wallpaper a week before- a photo that Bruce had taken of you and Tony goofing off in the lab, each of you wearing half of one of the suits Tony had been working on.</p><p>You quickly opened the text message application to avoid looking at the picture any longer, and sent Steve a text. \u201c<i>Please tell me you don\u2019t have a date for Saturday</i>.\u201d <br></p><hr><p><a

Just an idea, maybe it sparks a little something :P&rdquo;.</i></p><p><i>This somehow turned into 6,500+ words, so I&rsquo;m splitting it up into two parts. Why am I like this?

You could feel him staring and knew that he was seeping with impatience, but you remained unfazed as you continued to focus on the documents spread out on your desk- documents that he had forgotten to review and sign before the deadline, so you were doing it for him now.</p><p>&ldquo;You could be a god and I could still ignore you,&rdquo; you said curtly, flipping to the next page.</p><p>&ldquo;You- I- you can&rsquo;t talk to your boss like that,&rdquo; he stammered, somehow still surprised at your audacious remarks to him, even after several long months of this perpetual cycle.</p><p>&ldquo;So fire me,&rdquo; you quipped as you closed the folder and tossed it on the desk.</p><p>You finally met his gaze and found him with his mouth ajar, finally unable to retort.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right, you can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; you continued, returning your eyes to the contents on your desk and opening up another file, &ldquo;because you can&rsquo;t run this company without me. You can barely make it through the biweekly board meeting without me. And can you imagine the headlines? <i><b>Tech Empire Ceo Superhero Billionaire Playboy Philanthropist Fires Assistant Because She Wouldn&rsquo;t Screw Him.</b></i> Not quite the image you want, especially after your little yacht incident.&rdquo;</p><p>Eight months ago, you were hired to fix the mess that Tony had made of his PR department after crashing his yacht into a cruise dock. He was sued by 13 out of the 20 supermodels that were with him, and charged for boating under the influence. Of course, he was able to buy his way out of all of it, but you really had your hands full scrubbing away all the media evidence and organizing a press tour to frame him in a slightly better light.</p><p>In two months, the event had been long forgotten by the world thanks to you and the team that you had led. At that time, he realized he could probably use a full-time assistant (manager&hellip; babysitter&hellip; ), so he offered you a position and a paygrade you couldn&rsquo;t refuse. It only took three weeks after that for him to start hitting on you, and since then you&rsquo;ve been doing all of the &lsquo;boring&rsquo; parts of his work for him, while all he&rsquo;s done is flirt and pester you day in and day out.</p><p>&ldquo;Can we please stop bringing up the yacht thing? Everyone else has forgotten it, why can&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; Tony insisted, crossing his arms across his chest.</p><p>&ldquo;I can forget it, but I choose not to,&rdquo; you said, signing his signature across the bottom of an approval draft and then moving on to the next packet, &ldquo;That event and the weeks that followed told me everything I need to know about you. Knowing those things help me do my job, the job that you hired me for.&rdquo;</p><p>They also helped you protect your heart from falling for him, but you certainly weren&rsquo;t going to tell him that.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, but still,&rdquo; he pleaded, shoving his hands in his back pockets and leaning forward so that his waist was pressed against your desk, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m not trying to screw you. You know that&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m asking&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>You signed the last document and closed the last folder, slipped the ones you needed to mail out into your bag, and clicked off the lamp on your desk, thrusting the room into a soft darkness illuminated only by the glow of the city below your office window.</p><p>&ldquo;That is what you&rsquo;re asking, Mr. Stark,&rdquo; you stated, watching him cringe at your continuous refusal to simply call him Tony, &ldquo;Maybe not right now, not this very moment, but eventually, down the line, it&rsquo;s expected,&rdquo; you stated as you stood from your chair but stayed behind the desk, keeping the safe distance between the two of you, &ldquo;Maybe it starts with coffee, or wine, or dinner, but I&rsquo;ve seen enough of your past and cleaned up enough of your messes to know that that&rsquo;s what it always leads to with you. That&rsquo;s always what the question means. You&rsquo;ve just never had anyone tell you &lsquo;no&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p>Without another word you walked out of the office and left him standing in the darkness without a chance to respond.</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>You headed down to your office early the next morning, coffee in hand and the conversation from the night before pushed completely out of your mind. You refused to develop feelings for him, so that meant that you could never linger on his offers or on the conversations that followed them. You couldn&rsquo;t beat yourself up for being a little harsher than necessary, or for ignoring the way your heart would flutter just the slightest bit when he&rsquo;d say your name. You wouldn&rsquo;t allow yourself to be just another number on the list of people he&rsquo;s slept with or another name in a headline about him.</p><p>And you&rsquo;d gotten good at avoiding him, limiting the amount of times you had to see him or the amount of opportunities he had to ask you out. When you were officially hired for the full-time position, he moved you into a room in his penthouse at the top of the tower, because it made the most sense for you to be onsite whenever he needed you, and for you to be just a few floors away from the offices and labs to avoid the city traffic everyday. At first, you worried that it would be a risk at worst or awkward at best, living just down the hall from him, but most mornings you were down in your office before he was even awake, and most nights he was down in the lab or the garage tinkering away at another project, leaving you to have the penthouse to yourself until late in the evenings.</p><p>But despite the facade that you wore so well, your resolve was slowly wearing down and you found yourself letting the butterflies linger a little longer than you&rsquo;d like, especially when he made little gestures that convinced you that he cared more than you were willing to believe.</p><p>Like now, when you walked into your office to find a massive bouquet of red roses sitting on the center of your desk.</p><p>You set your coffee and bag on the desk and inspected the gorgeous arrangement until you found a small gold envelope. You slipped the envelope from it&rsquo;s holder and opened it up to find a handwritten note on a little white piece of paper. You knew it was Tony&rsquo;s handwriting because you&rsquo;d learned to imitate it, and you were surprised he&rsquo;d taken the time to write this note himself.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;re right - I can&rsquo;t do this without you. I&rsquo;m sorry.</i>&rdquo;</p><p>You slid the note back into the envelope and placed it in the top drawer of your desk before moving the flowers safely to one side of your desk. Before you could even sit down, your phone rang. You fished it out of your bag and saw Tony&rsquo;s name and photo lighting up your screen. It was odd for him to be up this early.</p><p>&ldquo;Good morning, Mr. Stark,&rdquo; you said professionally as you answered the phone.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you get the flowers?&rdquo; he asked immediately, and you could tell he was trying to hide the pride and excitement in his voice.</p><p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; you responded courteously, hoping to sound like you appreciated them without revealing just how impressed you were by them, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re lovely. Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Great! I&rsquo;m in the gym, should be done in twenty. Let&rsquo;s meet in an hour to discuss the project proposals that came in last week. I looked over two of them this morning that I think look promising. I&rsquo;ll come to you,&rdquo; he said, and before you could even process what he had said, he ended the call.</p><p>Tony was rarely out of bed at this hour, so for him to be in the gym and not complaining about it so early was shocking enough. But for him to be aware of a task that needed to be done and ahead of it before you even gave him the first reminder was unbelievable. You had braced yourself for whatever flirty comment you knew would come with those flowers, but instead he was all business.</p><p>The meeting went by as remarkably as the call did. He was as polite and as friendly as ever, but there wasn&rsquo;t even a hint of flirtation or intention behind any of his words. He focused on the tasks and was prepared to ask and answer questions about the proposals, and even signed them himself without complaining. You kept waiting for a quip or an unprofessional comment, but none ever came.</p><p>You spent the rest of the day in the same state of pleasant surprise as every meeting and task went by timely and successfully, and by the end of the day you were both ahead of schedule and your to-do list was completely cleared. You had actually managed to get off work on time. You returned to your office to collect your things. You were straightening up the files on your desk for tomorrow when Tony appeared in your doorway. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Got any plans tonight?&rdquo; he asked casually, fiddling with a Newton&rsquo;s Cradle figure on your desk.</p><p><i>Didn&rsquo;t even last a day</i>, you thought, assuming he was asking so he could ask you out again.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, actually,&rdquo; you said as you stored the last file in the organizer and grabbed your bag, &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m going to go see a movie with Wanda.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good! You should go have some fun,&rdquo; he said with a soft smile.</p><p><i>Well that was unexpected.</i></p><p>You were too dumbfounded to really say anything, so you just stammered something similar to a &ldquo;yeah&rdquo; as you tried to carry both your bag and vase of flowers around your desk towards the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Here, I&rsquo;ll take these up for you,&rdquo; Tony offered, carefully taking the bouquet from your hands, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave them on the counter in the kitchen.</p><p>The two of you silently walked together to the two elevators at the end of the hall, and he pressed both the up and down buttons. When your elevator arrived to take you to the garage, he simply told you to have a good night. Once the elevator doors closed you leaned against the sidewall, still trying to process what in the world had happened.</p><p>You felt like you were living in some alternate universe were Tony didn&rsquo;t incessantly hit on you or never got any work done. You half expected to wake up the next day and everything be back to normal, as if it was just a fluke or a weird dream, but that wasn&rsquo;t the case. For the next ten weeks, Tony was a powerhouse of productivity. He was in the gym every morning before you had even made your coffee, he attended every meeting punctually, and he was constantly engaged and involved in the current projects. He was even using his own office more, for actual work and not just for storage of random project drafts.</p><p>He also hadn&rsquo;t flirted with you, hit on you, or made even the slightest attempt to ask you out. It made your job a million times easier, and you actually enjoyed being able to interact with him closely without fear of overstepping professional boundaries. And while a small part of you missed the little flirty comments and the way they made you feel despite you always pretending like you loathed them, you were ultimately happy with the progress in your strictly professional relationship with Tony, and the risk of developing deeper feelings for him was long behind you.</p><p>Or so you thought, until you walked into his office to find him with a gorgeous blonde who you had never seen before.</p><p>They weren&rsquo;t doing anything, just sitting across from each other on either side of Tony&rsquo;s desk, but she was stunning and he was smiling, and for some reason, that bothered you.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry to interrupt, I didn&rsquo;t know you were with anyone,&rdquo; you said, keeping a perfect posture as you stood in the doorway, &ldquo;we have a briefing meeting with the new project team in an hour and I wanted to go over the itinerary. But I&rsquo;ll just email it to you-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, no, it&rsquo;s fine, I was just leaving,&rdquo; the bombshell said with a dazzling smile as she rose from her chair.</p><p>Tony stood and walked around the desk to meet her, shaking her hand as they whispered exchanges through flirty smiles. Her heels clacked on the concrete floor as she sauntered past you, and you tried to bury the feeling that was bubbling up inside you. Was it&hellip; jealousy? It couldn&rsquo;t be. You&rsquo;d never truly envied another woman, and you didn&rsquo;t have feelings for Tony. So why would you care, now?</p><p>You&rsquo;d been staring at your own feet while you tried to process this and lost yourself in your train of thought until you finally registered Tony calling your name.</p><p>&ldquo;Earth to Y/N,&rdquo; he laughed.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, sorry. Yes?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The itinerary?&rdquo;</p><p>He was leaning back against the front of his desk, one hand in his pocket and the other extended, waiting for you to bring him the document. You strode forward, trying to clear your head and control your expression so that you wouldn&rsquo;t give yourself away, but it was easier said than done once you were close enough to him to smell his cologne.</p><p>&ldquo;You smell nice,&rdquo; you commented without thinking as you handed him the paper.</p><p>You saw him smirk at your compliment, but before he could respond you immediately began a run through of the meeting order, hoping you could distract him long enough that he would forget and so that you could regain your own composure.</p><p>Luckily, he seemed to let it go and you were able to push down those feelings long enough to get to the meeting and through the rest of the day. But after work you spent the whole night tossing and turning in bed, wondering just exactly why you had felt that way&hellip; why seeing him with this beautiful stranger in his office with her sitting in the seat you usually sat in would bother you so much.</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>You only got a few hours of sleep, but when you woke up the next morning you were determined to renounce any feelings you could have for Tony. You realized that even though he hadn&rsquo;t flirted with you in over two months, you had gotten comfortable with him, and you had begun to let your own guard down- something you swore you&rsquo;d never do when you took this job. </p><p>You figured that it would be easy to get back on track, especially since he had been respecting your professional relationship, and it would be even easier if he did suddenly have a girlfriend (once you could truly get over your feelings of jealousy and not just ignore them).</p><p>And it was easy, for most of that day, but only because you hadn&rsquo;t seen him. He had sent you a text after the gym saying he was heading down to the lab to work out some kinks in the latest project, and you hadn&rsquo;t heard from him since.</p><p>Your work flew by as you made the last minute preparations and confirmed the orders for the formal party that Tony was hosting Saturday evening. It had been scheduled months ago and you did all of the planning and made all of the orders immediately, so you only had a few small details left to finalize. </p><p>You finished your work for the day and had just made a mental note to remind Tony of the event (since it was something that had been scheduled long before he had re-invested himself in the company) when you heard a knock on your office door.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; Tony smirked as he strut into your office. His Black Sabbath t-shirt had a small rip near his ribs and there were grease marks on his face and neck.</p><p>&ldquo;What in the world have you been working on,&rdquo; you laughed, taking in his disheveled appearance.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s classified,&rdquo; he winked.</p><p>You rolled your eyes, trying to appear once again unfazed but unable to fully ignore the butterflies that fluttered at that wink and smirk.</p><p>&ldquo;Project 48,&rdquo; he said, giving you an actual answer, &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s not important. I have a party on Saturday.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know, I planned it,&rdquo; you stated as you put away your last folders.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, but I- thank you, for doing that by the way-,&rdquo; he said quickly and almost nervously, &ldquo;but I want you to come with me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I figured I was already invited, since I planned the whole event, and it&rsquo;s in the penthouse which I also live in, so&hellip;&rdquo; you laughed, not understanding what he meant.</p><p>&ldquo;No, I want you to come with me,&rdquo; he rephrased with a bit of hesitation, &ldquo;as my date.&rdquo;</p><p>Your world froze and your mind flooded with a thousand thoughts and questions.<i> Why was he asking you out now after months of not even one flirtatious comment? Why wasn&rsquo;t he asking the blonde from yesterday? Why are you so relieved that he&rsquo;s asking you, instead? Why do you want to say yes? You have to say no, right? You have to say no.</i></p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, I already have a date,&rdquo; you blurted out before realizing that it wasn&rsquo;t true at all but was simply the best way of saying &lsquo;no&rsquo; that your mind could come up with on the spot. </p><p>&ldquo;You do? <i>Who</i>?&rdquo; he asked, clearly not expecting that answer.</p><p>&ldquo;Steve.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Rogers? Really?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony almost seemed offended at this point, but he eventually just said okay and apologized for asking. Before you could say anything else, he turned around and walked out of your office. You hung your head in your hands with your elbows on your desk, cursing yourself for all the emotions you were feeling and wondering what was worse- the fact that he asked you out for the millionth time or the fact that you denied him yet again.</p><p>You picked up your phone from off your desk and swiped across the screen to unlock it, sighing when you were greeted with the photo you had just set as your wallpaper a week before- a photo that Bruce had taken of you and Tony goofing off in the lab, each of you wearing half of one of the suits Tony had been working on.</p><p>You quickly opened the text message application to avoid looking at the picture any longer, and sent Steve a text. &ldquo;<i>Please tell me you don&rsquo;t have a date for Saturday</i>.&rdquo; <br /></p><hr
