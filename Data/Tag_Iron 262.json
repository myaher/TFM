Tony looked up from his phone when he heard Peter walking towards him.</p><p>\u201cMorning sleepy head.\u201d</p><p>Peter smiled, \u201cMorning old man.\u201d</p><p>Tony faked offense, \u201cHey now, that\u2019s Steve\u2019s title.\u201d</p><p>Peter froze, remembering the events of the evening before. He didn\u2019t even notice that his bowl began overflowing with cereal.</p><p>\u201cKid,\u201d Tony grabbed Peter\u2019s wrist, pulling him back into reality.</p><p>\u201cCrap! I\u2019m sorry!\u201d He went to clean up his mess, but Tony grabbed his wrist again, stopping him.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>Peter looked down at the table, pointedly not looking at his mentor, \u201cUm, about what?\u201d</p><p>Tony sighed, \u201cAbout yesterday, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather not-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a request, Peter.\u201d Tony winced when his voice came out a little harsher than he meant.</p><p>Peter fell farther into his chair, curling in on himself.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Tony put his head in his hands, \u201cSteve and I have some, issues, yes. But I don\u2019t hate him. We both acted like children back in that bunker. We should have stopped and just talked it through, but we let Zemo get exactly what he wanted. He got to us, and we tore ourselves apart.\u201d</p><p>Peter finally looked up, \u201cBut-!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh ah! No buts, the adult is talking.\u201d</p><p>Peter huffed, his eyebrows furrowing, and he fell back into the chair once again.</p><p>\u201cSteve and I are\u2026 We\u2019re still working on what happened. Am I still mad at him for not telling me what happened? Yes. But we\u2019re both adults, Pete. And the world still needs us. So we can\u2019t let a fight be what causes us to lose in the face of a threat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I saw-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI talked with Friday, I know what you saw. And I know it looked bad. I don\u2019t blame you for being mad at him. But, I\u2019m really trying to make things right. We both are. It\u2019s just hard, after everything that happened. And I could really use you in my corner.\u201d</p><p>Peter looked up at Tony and saw that his eyes were suspiciously wet.</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019ll always be in your corner, dad.\u201d</p><p>Tony smiled, \u201cI know. I just need you to maybe, not start fights with grandpa. We\u2019ll both figure this out, okay? Just try to get along with him.\u201d</p><p>Peter shifted his gaze to his hands, \u201cOkay,\u201d he replied quietly.</p><p>Tony sniffed, wiping away the moisture from his eyes, \u201cOkay, that\u2019s enough feelings for today.\u201d</p><p>Peter giggled, rolling his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re done, we\u2019re gonna go down and properly introduce you to everyone.\u201d</p><p>Peter choked on his cereal, \u201cWhat??\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey need to meet my kid! You know, without holding him hostage.\u201d Tony winked and Peter groaned.</p><p>***</p><p>When the two finished breakfast, Peter followed Tony to the elevator.</p><p>Not that Peter would admit it, but he was super excited. He was going to get to meet the Avengers! Properly!</p><p>Granted, he wasn\u2019t all that excited about meeting Steve again, but beggars can\u2019t be choosers.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d </p><p>Peter looked up to see Tony staring down at him with concern.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Yeah! I\u2019m fine. Promise.\u201d He smiled in an attempt to convince the older man.</p><p>Tony searched his kid\u2019s face looking for any signs of deceit, but smiled when he found none.</p><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d He slapped a hand on Peter\u2019s back, \u201cI told them to behave, no shouting or arguing like last night. So you should be good.\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded just as the elevator dinged, coming to a stop. Tony stepped out first, Peter following suit. Looking around his mentor, Peter saw everyone sitting in the common room, much like they had been yesterday.</p><p>Tony clapped his hands, startling Peter and getting the attention of everyone in the room.</p><p>He had a talent for that.</p><p>\u201cI want you all to officially meet Peter.\u201d He stepped to the side, allowing everyone to see his kid. </p><p>Peter squirmed under everyone\u2019s gaze, his cheeks heating up a bright red.</p><p>Tony threw an arm around him as a form of comfort. He could tell Peter was nervous just by the way he fidgeted with his sleeves in the elevator. He may have been fine, but he was still nervous. And everyone staring at him didn\u2019t help.</p><p>He pushed himself into Tony\u2019s side, \u201cH-hey.\u201d He gave a small wave.</p><p>Wanda was the first to walk up to him, immediately jumping off the couch, \u201cHello Peter.\u201d She smiled, offering him her small hand.</p><p>He hesitated before taking it in his and shook it.</p><p>\u201cI want to apologize for tossing you across the room yesterday. I thought you were an intruder.\u201d Her voice sounds unsure, her smile wavering.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay.\u201d He quickly assured her, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have been eavesdropping.\u201d Peter offered her a smile.</p><p>Wanda returns it with a larger smile, \u201cVision has told me a lot about you. I hope we can become friends. It would be nice to know somebody close to my age.\u201d</p><p>Peter, who had very few friends himself (two to be exact), basically jumped at the offer, \u201cYeah! That would be awesome!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, my turn!\u201d Sam ran up behind Wanda, also extending his hand, \u201cI\u2019m Sam. Nice to meet you, spider child.\u201d</p><p>Peter rolled his eyes, but shook his hand as well, \u201cYou keep calling me a child, but that only makes the fact that I beat your butt back in Germany that much worse.\u201d</p><p>Sam\u2019s mouth dropped open and Tony barked out a laugh, squeezing Peter, \u201cThat\u2019s my boy.\u201d</p><p>Sam sputtered, \u201cIf anything, I beat <i>your </i>ass, punk.\u201d He playfully shoved Peter\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Peter shrugged, \u201cTechnically, your drone did. You were already webbed to the ground.\u201d</p><p>Sam slapped a hand on his chest, \u201cI\u2018m offended,\u201d he then turned to Tony, \u201cI like him.\u201d</p><p>Tony chuckled, \u201cYeah, he tends to have that effect on people.\u201d</p><p>Natasha and Clint were next.</p><p>\u201cHi Peter. It\u2019s nice to finally meet you.\u201d Natasha gave him a small smile.</p><p>Peter\u2019s nerves suddenly came back full force. He was meeting <i>the</i> Black Widow! And <i>the </i>Hawkeye!</p><p>He thought he might faint.</p><p>Tony gently shook him, \u201cEarth to Peter?\u201d</p><p>Peter shook his head, \u201cSorry&hellip; H-Hi! It\u2019s so cool to meet you. I\u2019m like, a big fan.\u201d </p><p>Sam yelled in the background, \u201cYO WHAT THE <i>FUCK</i>-\u201d </p><p>\u201cSam!\u201d Steve hissed.</p><p>Clint spoke, ignoring the two behind him, \u201cI\u2019m Clint. You\u2019ve got guts kid, standing up to Captain America like that,\u201d</p><p>Natasha smacked the back of his head and Tony groaned, \u201cClint!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?? He\u2019s a spunky little shit! I like him!\u201d</p><p>Tony facepalmed, and Natasha grabbed Clint, pulling him away. But not before Peter heard Clint whisper to her, \u201cI think we\u2019re gonna be best buds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse you, but we\u2019re spider pals. Back off.\u201d</p><p>Peter giggled at them, knowing they probably weren\u2019t aware he could hear them, and at the fact that the Black freaking Widow just called <i>him </i>her spider pal.</p><p>He was pulled from his thoughts when he felt Tony let go of him, pushing him forward.</p><p>He looked up to see Steve standing in front of him, a few feet between them.</p><p>Steve looked just as uncomfortable as Peter felt.</p><p>\u201cI guess you already know me.\u201d He gave a small smile, \u201cI just wanted to apologize for yesterday, and for, you know, everything else.\u201d</p><p>Peter was silent for a few moments before Tony cleared his throat, silently telling Peter<i> your turn</i>.</p><p>\u201cOh right,\u201d He began playing with his sleeves again, \u201cUm, I\u2019m sorry for how I acted yesterday. I thought I knew the full story, but I guess I didn\u2019t.

But I don\u2019t hate him. We both acted like children back in that bunker. We should have stopped and just talked it through, but we let Zemo get exactly what he wanted. He got to us, and we tore ourselves apart.\u201d</p><p>Peter finally looked up, \u201cBut-!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh ah! No buts, the adult is talking.\u201d</p><p>Peter huffed, his eyebrows furrowing, and he fell back into the chair once again.</p><p>\u201cSteve and I are\u2026 We\u2019re still working on what happened. Am I still mad at him for not telling me what happened? Yes. But we\u2019re both adults, Pete. And the world still needs us. So we can\u2019t let a fight be what causes us to lose in the face of a threat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I saw-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI talked with Friday, I know what you saw. And I know it looked bad. I don\u2019t blame you for being mad at him. But, I\u2019m really trying to make things right. We both are. It\u2019s just hard, after everything that happened. And I could really use you in my corner.\u201d</p><p>Peter looked up at Tony and saw that his eyes were suspiciously wet.</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019ll always be in your corner, dad.\u201d</p><p>Tony smiled, \u201cI know. I just need you to maybe, not start fights with grandpa. We\u2019ll both figure this out, okay? Just try to get along with him.\u201d</p><p>Peter shifted his gaze to his hands, \u201cOkay,\u201d he replied quietly.</p><p>Tony sniffed, wiping away the moisture from his eyes, \u201cOkay, that\u2019s enough feelings for today.\u201d</p><p>Peter giggled, rolling his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re done, we\u2019re gonna go down and properly introduce you to everyone.\u201d</p><p>Peter choked on his cereal, \u201cWhat??\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey need to meet my kid! You know, without holding him hostage.\u201d Tony winked and Peter groaned.</p><p>***</p><p>When the two finished breakfast, Peter followed Tony to the elevator.</p><p>Not that Peter would admit it, but he was super excited. He was going to get to meet the Avengers! Properly!</p><p>Granted, he wasn\u2019t all that excited about meeting Steve again, but beggars can\u2019t be choosers.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d </p><p>Peter looked up to see Tony staring down at him with concern.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Yeah! I\u2019m fine. Promise.\u201d He smiled in an attempt to convince the older man.</p><p>Tony searched his kid\u2019s face looking for any signs of deceit, but smiled when he found none.</p><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d He slapped a hand on Peter\u2019s back, \u201cI told them to behave, no shouting or arguing like last night. So you should be good.\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded just as the elevator dinged, coming to a stop. Tony stepped out first, Peter following suit. Looking around his mentor, Peter saw everyone sitting in the common room, much like they had been yesterday.</p><p>Tony clapped his hands, startling Peter and getting the attention of everyone in the room.</p><p>He had a talent for that.</p><p>\u201cI want you all to officially meet Peter.\u201d He stepped to the side, allowing everyone to see his kid. </p><p>Peter squirmed under everyone\u2019s gaze, his cheeks heating up a bright red.</p><p>Tony threw an arm around him as a form of comfort. He could tell Peter was nervous just by the way he fidgeted with his sleeves in the elevator. He may have been fine, but he was still nervous. And everyone staring at him didn\u2019t help.</p><p>He pushed himself into Tony\u2019s side, \u201cH-hey.\u201d He gave a small wave.</p><p>Wanda was the first to walk up to him, immediately jumping off the couch, \u201cHello Peter.\u201d She smiled, offering him her small hand.</p><p>He hesitated before taking it in his and shook it.</p><p>\u201cI want to apologize for tossing you across the room yesterday. I thought you were an intruder.\u201d Her voice sounds unsure, her smile wavering.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay.\u201d He quickly assured her, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have been eavesdropping.\u201d Peter offered her a smile.</p><p>Wanda returns it with a larger smile, \u201cVision has told me a lot about you. I hope we can become friends. It would be nice to know somebody close to my age.\u201d</p><p>Peter, who had very few friends himself (two to be exact), basically jumped at the offer, \u201cYeah! That would be awesome!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, my turn!\u201d Sam ran up behind Wanda, also extending his hand, \u201cI\u2019m Sam. Nice to meet you, spider child.\u201d</p><p>Peter rolled his eyes, but shook his hand as well, \u201cYou keep calling me a child, but that only makes the fact that I beat your butt back in Germany that much worse.\u201d</p><p>Sam\u2019s mouth dropped open and Tony barked out a laugh, squeezing Peter, \u201cThat\u2019s my boy.\u201d</p><p>Sam sputtered, \u201cIf anything, I beat <i>your </i>ass, punk.\u201d He playfully shoved Peter\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Peter shrugged, \u201cTechnically, your drone did. You were already webbed to the ground.\u201d</p><p>Sam slapped a hand on his chest, \u201cI\u2018m offended,\u201d he then turned to Tony, \u201cI like him.\u201d</p><p>Tony chuckled, \u201cYeah, he tends to have that effect on people.\u201d</p><p>Natasha and Clint were next.</p><p>\u201cHi Peter. It\u2019s nice to finally meet you.\u201d Natasha gave him a small smile.</p><p>Peter\u2019s nerves suddenly came back full force. He was meeting <i>the</i> Black Widow! And <i>the </i>Hawkeye!</p><p>He thought he might faint.</p><p>Tony gently shook him, \u201cEarth to Peter?\u201d</p><p>Peter shook his head, \u201cSorry\u2026 H-Hi! It\u2019s so cool to meet you. I\u2019m like, a big fan.\u201d </p><p>Sam yelled in the background, \u201cYO WHAT THE <i>FUCK</i>-\u201d </p><p>\u201cSam!\u201d Steve hissed.</p><p>Clint spoke, ignoring the two behind him, \u201cI\u2019m Clint. You\u2019ve got guts kid, standing up to Captain America like that,\u201d</p><p>Natasha smacked the back of his head and Tony groaned, \u201cClint!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?? He\u2019s a spunky little shit! I like him!\u201d</p><p>Tony facepalmed, and Natasha grabbed Clint, pulling him away. But not before Peter heard Clint whisper to her, \u201cI think we\u2019re gonna be best buds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse you, but we\u2019re spider pals. Back off.\u201d</p><p>Peter giggled at them, knowing they probably weren\u2019t aware he could hear them, and at the fact that the Black freaking Widow just called <i>him </i>her spider pal.</p><p>He was pulled from his thoughts when he felt Tony let go of him, pushing him forward.</p><p>He looked up to see Steve standing in front of him, a few feet between them.</p><p>Steve looked just as uncomfortable as Peter felt.</p><p>\u201cI guess you already know me.\u201d He gave a small smile, \u201cI just wanted to apologize for yesterday, and for, you know, everything else.\u201d</p><p>Peter was silent for a few moments before Tony cleared his throat, silently telling Peter<i> your turn</i>.</p><p>\u201cOh right,\u201d He began playing with his sleeves again, \u201cUm, I\u2019m sorry for how I acted yesterday. I thought I knew the full story, but I guess I didn\u2019t. I acted like a child.\u201d </p><p>He heard Sam in the background whisper to someone, \u201cWell technically he is a child- <i>ow</i>!\u201d</p><p>Steve smiled a little brighter, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, kid. I hurt Tony.

But he may as well be. He\u2019s got my brains and my good looks.\u201d</p><p>Peter groaned, \u201cMister Staaaark!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey now, you called me dad.

I\u2019m like, a big fan.\u201d </p><p>Sam yelled in the background, \u201cYO WHAT THE <i>FUCK</i>-\u201d </p><p>\u201cSam!\u201d Steve hissed.</p><p>Clint spoke, ignoring the two behind him, \u201cI\u2019m Clint. You\u2019ve got guts kid, standing up to Captain America like that,\u201d</p><p>Natasha smacked the back of his head and Tony groaned, \u201cClint!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?? He\u2019s a spunky little shit! I like him!\u201d</p><p>Tony facepalmed, and Natasha grabbed Clint, pulling him away. But not before Peter heard Clint whisper to her, \u201cI think we\u2019re gonna be best buds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse you, but we\u2019re spider pals. Back off.\u201d</p><p>Peter giggled at them, knowing they probably weren\u2019t aware he could hear them, and at the fact that the Black freaking Widow just called <i>him </i>her spider pal.</p><p>He was pulled from his thoughts when he felt Tony let go of him, pushing him forward.</p><p>He looked up to see Steve standing in front of him, a few feet between them.</p><p>Steve looked just as uncomfortable as Peter felt.</p><p>\u201cI guess you already know me.\u201d He gave a small smile, \u201cI just wanted to apologize for yesterday, and for, you know, everything else.\u201d</p><p>Peter was silent for a few moments before Tony cleared his throat, silently telling Peter<i> your turn</i>.</p><p>\u201cOh right,\u201d He began playing with his sleeves again, \u201cUm, I\u2019m sorry for how I acted yesterday. I thought I knew the full story, but I guess I didn\u2019t. I acted like a child.\u201d </p><p>He heard Sam in the background whisper to someone, \u201cWell technically he is a child- <i>ow</i>!\u201d</p><p>Steve smiled a little brighter, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, kid. I hurt Tony. You had every right to be mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t encourage my kid, Rogers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, speaking of,\u201d Clint called from the couch, \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell us you had a child, Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a child!\u201d Peter threw his head back in frustration.</p><p>Tony chuckled, stepping forward and pulling Peter back into his side, \u201cYeah well, he\u2019s not biologically mine. But he may as well be. He\u2019s got my brains and my good looks.\u201d</p><p>Peter groaned, \u201cMister Staaaark!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey now, you called me dad. We\u2019re not going back to formalities.\u201d</p><p>Peter rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnyways, his aunt and I co-parent him. So really, he\u2019s my kid all the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn aunt huh?\u201d Sam asked, \u201cShe single?\u201d</p><p>Tony grinned and nodded, \u201cSuper attractive too.\u201d</p><p>Peter squawked, burying his face in his hands, \u201cOH MY GOD.\u201d</p>",

Tony looked up from his phone when he heard Peter walking towards him.</p><p>&ldquo;Morning sleepy head.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter smiled, &ldquo;Morning old man.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony faked offense, &ldquo;Hey now, that&rsquo;s Steve&rsquo;s title.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter froze, remembering the events of the evening before. He didn&rsquo;t even notice that his bowl began overflowing with cereal.</p><p>&ldquo;Kid,&rdquo; Tony grabbed Peter&rsquo;s wrist, pulling him back into reality.</p><p>&ldquo;Crap! I&rsquo;m sorry!&rdquo; He went to clean up his mess, but Tony grabbed his wrist again, stopping him.</p><p>&ldquo;We need to talk.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter looked down at the table, pointedly not looking at his mentor, &ldquo;Um, about what?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony sighed, &ldquo;About yesterday, kiddo.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather not-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t a request, Peter.&rdquo; Tony winced when his voice came out a little harsher than he meant.</p><p>Peter fell farther into his chair, curling in on himself.</p><p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; Tony put his head in his hands, &ldquo;Steve and I have some, issues, yes. But I don&rsquo;t hate him. We both acted like children back in that bunker. We should have stopped and just talked it through, but we let Zemo get exactly what he wanted. He got to us, and we tore ourselves apart.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter finally looked up, &ldquo;But-!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah ah! No buts, the adult is talking.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter huffed, his eyebrows furrowing, and he fell back into the chair once again.</p><p>&ldquo;Steve and I are&hellip; We&rsquo;re still working on what happened. Am I still mad at him for not telling me what happened? Yes. But we&rsquo;re both adults, Pete. And the world still needs us. So we can&rsquo;t let a fight be what causes us to lose in the face of a threat.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I saw-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I talked with Friday, I know what you saw. And I know it looked bad. I don&rsquo;t blame you for being mad at him. But, I&rsquo;m really trying to make things right. We both are. It&rsquo;s just hard, after everything that happened. And I could really use you in my corner.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter looked up at Tony and saw that his eyes were suspiciously wet.</p><p>&ldquo;You know I&rsquo;ll always be in your corner, dad.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony smiled, &ldquo;I know. I just need you to maybe, not start fights with grandpa. We&rsquo;ll both figure this out, okay? Just try to get along with him.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter shifted his gaze to his hands, &ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; he replied quietly.</p><p>Tony sniffed, wiping away the moisture from his eyes, &ldquo;Okay, that&rsquo;s enough feelings for today.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter giggled, rolling his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re done, we&rsquo;re gonna go down and properly introduce you to everyone.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter choked on his cereal, &ldquo;What??&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They need to meet my kid! You know, without holding him hostage.&rdquo; Tony winked and Peter groaned.</p><p>***</p><p>When the two finished breakfast, Peter followed Tony to the elevator.</p><p>Not that Peter would admit it, but he was super excited. He was going to get to meet the Avengers! Properly!</p><p>Granted, he wasn&rsquo;t all that excited about meeting Steve again, but beggars can&rsquo;t be choosers.</p><p>&ldquo;You okay?&rdquo; </p><p>Peter looked up to see Tony staring down at him with concern.</p><p>&ldquo;What? Yeah! I&rsquo;m fine. Promise.&rdquo; He smiled in an attempt to convince the older man.</p><p>Tony searched his kid&rsquo;s face looking for any signs of deceit, but smiled when he found none.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; He slapped a hand on Peter&rsquo;s back, &ldquo;I told them to behave, no shouting or arguing like last night. So you should be good.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nodded just as the elevator dinged, coming to a stop. Tony stepped out first, Peter following suit. Looking around his mentor, Peter saw everyone sitting in the common room, much like they had been yesterday.</p><p>Tony clapped his hands, startling Peter and getting the attention of everyone in the room.</p><p>He had a talent for that.</p><p>&ldquo;I want you all to officially meet Peter.&rdquo; He stepped to the side, allowing everyone to see his kid. </p><p>Peter squirmed under everyone&rsquo;s gaze, his cheeks heating up a bright red.</p><p>Tony threw an arm around him as a form of comfort. He could tell Peter was nervous just by the way he fidgeted with his sleeves in the elevator. He may have been fine, but he was still nervous. And everyone staring at him didn&rsquo;t help.</p><p>He pushed himself into Tony&rsquo;s side, &ldquo;H-hey.&rdquo; He gave a small wave.</p><p>Wanda was the first to walk up to him, immediately jumping off the couch, &ldquo;Hello Peter.&rdquo; She smiled, offering him her small hand.</p><p>He hesitated before taking it in his and shook it.</p><p>&ldquo;I want to apologize for tossing you across the room yesterday. I thought you were an intruder.&rdquo; Her voice sounds unsure, her smile wavering.</p><p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo; He quickly assured her, &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have been eavesdropping.&rdquo; Peter offered her a smile.</p><p>Wanda returns it with a larger smile, &ldquo;Vision has told me a lot about you. I hope we can become friends. It would be nice to know somebody close to my age.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter, who had very few friends himself (two to be exact), basically jumped at the offer, &ldquo;Yeah! That would be awesome!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, my turn!&rdquo; Sam ran up behind Wanda, also extending his hand, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Sam. Nice to meet you, spider child.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter rolled his eyes, but shook his hand as well, &ldquo;You keep calling me a child, but that only makes the fact that I beat your butt back in Germany that much worse.&rdquo;</p><p>Sam&rsquo;s mouth dropped open and Tony barked out a laugh, squeezing Peter, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my boy.&rdquo;</p><p>Sam sputtered, &ldquo;If anything, I beat <i>your </i>ass, punk.&rdquo; He playfully shoved Peter&rsquo;s shoulder.</p><p>Peter shrugged, &ldquo;Technically, your drone did. You were already webbed to the ground.&rdquo;</p><p>Sam slapped a hand on his chest, &ldquo;I&lsquo;m offended,&rdquo; he then turned to Tony, &ldquo;I like him.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony chuckled, &ldquo;Yeah, he tends to have that effect on people.&rdquo;</p><p>Natasha and Clint were next.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi Peter. It&rsquo;s nice to finally meet you.&rdquo; Natasha gave him a small smile.</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s nerves suddenly came back full force. He was meeting <i>the</i> Black Widow! And <i>the </i>Hawkeye!</p><p>He thought he might faint.</p><p>Tony gently shook him, &ldquo;Earth to Peter?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter shook his head, &ldquo;Sorry&hellip; H-Hi! It&rsquo;s so cool to meet you. I&rsquo;m like, a big fan.&rdquo; </p><p>Sam yelled in the background, &ldquo;YO WHAT THE <i>FUCK</i>-&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Sam!&rdquo; Steve hissed.</p><p>Clint spoke, ignoring the two behind him, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Clint. You&rsquo;ve got guts kid, standing up to Captain America like that,&rdquo;</p><p>Natasha smacked the back of his head and Tony groaned, &ldquo;Clint!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What??
