Your curtains were closed and your room was pitch\nblack \u2013 what time was it? You&rsquo;d been having a pleasant dream about\nbeing invited to a concert by your favorite musical artist and\nstriking up a friendship with them; so a flood of disappointment\nwashed over you the moment you realized that it was only that, a\ndream. The momentary disappointment was quickly replaced by fear; who\nwould be knocking on your window at this time of night? Was it a\nrobber testing to see if anyone was in the apartment? Was it an\nassociate of your would-be murderer, coming to finish you off? A\nthousand thoughts flooded through your mind as you slowly stepped out\nof bed, careful not to make any distinguishable noise. You tip-toed\nto the kitchen and carefully slid the largest and sharpest butcher\nknife from the wooden cutting block. \n</p><p>\nYour\nreflection looked back at you in the shining steel of the knife,\nsleep-deprived and obviously afraid. You searched your own alarmed\neyes and took a deep breath \u2013 you were <i>not</i> going to be the\nweak damsel again. Resolve formed behind the hesitance. With a nod to\nyourself, you tip-toed back to your room with the knife held above\nyour head, ready for instant action. Whoever or <i>what</i>ever the\nhell this was, they&rsquo;d picked the wrong fucking apartment to rob\ntonight.</p><p>\nAs\nyou approached, armed with determination and a huge-ass knife, the\nsoft tap sounded at the window again. You just barely kept yourself\nfrom jumping a mile into the air and giving away your position. With\ncaution, you reached your shaking hand toward the dark blue curtains,\nbarely able to distinguish your hand from the darkness. You held your\nbreath, and in what seemed like slow motion, your fingers closed\naround the rough fabric.</p><!-- more --><p>\nAll\nat once, you swung open the curtains, knife wielded in your firm\ngrasp, ready to defend yourself the moment it was necessary. You were\nmet with large white eyes that made you yelp, dropping the knife onto\nthe soft carpet of your bedroom as you stumbled back, hand clutched\nover your frantic heart. The muscle was trying to bust out of the\nprison of your rib cage and escape, as if was frightened itself. \n</p><p>\n\u201cWhoa,\nwhoa, whoa, I&rsquo;m sorry!\u201d came a frantic familiar voice, red hands\npressed against the glass in a concerned way. You threw your head\nback and sighed in relief, hand still grasping at your chest. It was\njust Spider-Man.</p><p>\nWait.\nIt was Spider-Man.</p><p>\n\u201cWhat\n\u2013 what are you doing here?\u201d you demanded in disbelief. \u201cWhat\ntime is it?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWell,\nI was just out, ya know, patrolling the city, and I \u2013 hey, could\nyou maybe open the window?\u201d he asked a little squeamishly, pointing\nto the closed latches on your windowsill. His large white eyes\nwidened innocently.</p><p>\nYou\nsighed exasperatedly at the scare he gave you, coming forward to do\nas he asked. You slowly lifted the bottom half of your window to\nallow in the chilly night breeze, Spider-Man standing back on your\nfire escape with his hands grasped together in an almost-ashamed way.\nIt was an odd oxymoron to see a hero so graceful standing there\nlooking so very awkward.</p><p>\n\u201cUm,\u201d\nyou began, arms crossed over your chest; you were suddenly painfully\naware of the bra you were lacking, \u201cwhat\u2014what&rsquo;s up, Spider-Man?\u201d\nThe words felt so surreal falling from your lips. The \u00a0retreating\nmelatonin, rushing adrenaline, and surprise mixing in your veins was\nquite the heady combination.</p><p>\nTo\nyour adding surprise, he looked even more awkward, staring at his\nfeet.</p><p>\n\u201cLike\nI said, I was just swinging around Queens, keeping an eye on stuff,\nya know?\u201d he shrugged, scratching at the back of his neck where you\nassumed his mask met his suit. \u201cAnd I was already in the\nneighborhood and thought, hey, I wonder how Y/N&rsquo;s doing?\u201d</p><p>\nYour\neyebrows rose. \u201cUm, wow&hellip; thanks for coming by, but I&rsquo;m doing\nfine. Keeping myself distracted with school and stuff.\u201d He nodded\nand clasped his hands behind his back, looking at his feet once\nagain. Your brows furrowed. \u201cWas there something else&hellip;?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cDid\nyou, uh, get my apple?\u201d he asked, looking up at you. The large\nwhite eyes somehow seemed hopeful. His kind voice certainly was. You\ncouldn&rsquo;t stop the embarrassingly large grin that stretched across\nyour face.</p><p>\n\u201cUm,\nyeah. Yeah, I did,\u201d you replied, hoping he could tell how thankful\nyou were for his thoughtfulness. \u201cThat was&hellip; so sweet. You didn&rsquo;t\nhave to do that.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI\ntold you I&rsquo;d walk you home \u2013 more or less,\u201d he shrugged, bashful.\nYou smiled even bigger. \u201cSo, uh&hellip; how was your first full day in\nNew York?\u201d</p><p>\nYour\nsmile reached your eyes as you looked at him, almost shaking your\nhead in disbelief. Spider-Man was here, on your fire escape, in the\nearly hours of the morning, checking on you and asking you about your\nfirst day. You had another &lsquo;Is this your life?&rsquo; moment.</p><p>\n\u201cIt\nwas okay, I guess,\u201d you laughed, your tone making your amusement at\nhis interest in you apparent. \u201cI went to my new school yesterday.\nKinda scary, a lot bigger than what I&rsquo;m used to.\u201d You stifled a\nyawn.</p><p>\n\u201cOh,\nokay, cool,\u201d he nodded, shifting his weight back and forth onto his\nright foot, then his left. He looked like he desperately wanted\nsomething, but what, you couldn&rsquo;t tell.</p><p>\n\u201cLook,\nI cannot put into words how much I appreciate you coming by, even\nthough you almost made me pee my pants,\u201d you chuckled, trying to\nkeep your tone light, \u201cbut what are you doing here, really?\u201d</p><p>\nHe\nsighed, and you imagined him biting his lip.</p><p>\n\u201cYou\nhave to promise not to ask any questions, okay? Because I can&rsquo;t tell\nyou anything.\u201d</p><p>\nYour\ninterest instantly piqued, you carefully climbed out of the window to\nmeet him on the fire escape. You kept your arms crossed to guard your\nbra-less chest against the cold New York wind. You sat on your\nwindowsill, trying to appear relaxed and friendly as you gave him an\nencouraging smile.</p><p>\n\u201cI\ndon&rsquo;t really know what all of this is about, but I promise,\u201d you\nsaid. Spider-Man crossed his arms as well and leaned against your\nrailing, crossing one ankle over the other. He stood out in an almost\nethereal way against the black night sky and the glowing lights of\nQueens below.</p><p>\n\u201cLet&rsquo;s\njust say that&hellip; I know a guy at Midtown High,\u201d he began\nhesitantly, and your brows automatically pulled together, \u201cand he\nfeels really awful about how he treated you at school yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\nYour\nmind instantly flashed to Peter Parker, or was it Ned? Was it maybe\none of the assholes who catcalled you throughout the day?</p><p>\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nyou asked, almost as if you didn&rsquo;t hear him correctly. What was he\ntelling you? That he is friends with Ned and Peter, or one of the\njerks that liked to ogle you from across the room? Did <i>he</i> go\nto Midtown High? Could Spider-Man really be that young? He <i>sounded</i>\nyoung.</p><p>\n\u201cYou\nsaid you wouldn&rsquo;t ask any questions,\u201d he reminded you, almost in a\npanicked way. His hands were held out in front of him as if they\nwould physically block the questions in your gaze and coming out of\nyour mouth.</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2014I\nknow,\u201d you said, trying to think of a way to phrase what you wanted\nto know without it technically asking something. \u201cNot asking a\nquestion\u2014but you&rsquo;re gonna have to clarify who feels awful. I had a\nfew incidents yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\nDid\nSpider-Man look <i>guilty</i>? Surely not, but you didn&rsquo;t know how\nelse to describe his hung head and lack of eye contact. He seemed\nincredibly uncomfortable. Well, it <i>did</i> suck having to play the\nmessenger between two parties, you reminded yourself.</p><p>\n\u201cNot\na good first day?\u201d he asked, and he sounded like he wanted to punch\nhimself in the face.</p><p>\n\u201cSome\nguys are assholes,\u201d you said simply, tone still light. \u201cLook, you\ndon&rsquo;t have to play intermediary for whoever it is. They can apologize\nthemselves, you know.\u201d</p><p>\nHe\nsighed heavily, his shoulders slumping with it. \u201cYou&rsquo;re right.\nI&rsquo;ll, uh, I&rsquo;ll let him know. But he does feel like a total jerk.\u201d</p><p>\nYou\nsquinted at him and tilted your head to the side, trying to somehow\nlook past his lensed white eyes and into his mind. He looked back,\nhis mask unusually inexpressive: a perfect poker face. The air was\ntense.</p><p>\n\u201cHe\ndoes?\u201d you asked, but it sounded more like a statement than a\nquestion. \n</p><p>\nSpider-Man\nnodded earnestly. \n</p><p>\nUncrossing\nyour arms, you stood up from your position on the windowsill and\nstepped closer to the guy who saved your life, twice. You smiled at\nhim. He stopped leaning against your rail and stood up as well, a\nfull head taller than you. You craned your neck a bit to look into\nthe eyes of his mask.</p><p>\n\u201cEnough\nabout me,\u201d you smiled softly, \u201cwhat about you? How was <i>your</i>\nday, Spidey?\u201d</p><p>\nHe\nchuckled a bit uneasily, and his hand started rubbing the back of his\nneck again. You could see him smiling underneath the mask, and if you\ndidn&rsquo;t know better, you&rsquo;d say he seemed a bit flustered.</p><p>\n\u201cOh,\nyou know, the usual,\u201d he said, and you were overwhelmed by fondness\nfor his apparent bashfulness. \u201cStopped a homeless guy from breaking\ninto an ATM a few blocks away, walked an old lady home who forgot\nwhere she lived \u2013 again. Stopped by to check on this girl&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\nYou\nlaughed. \u201cLucky her. Do you stop by and wake up all the girls you\nsave in the wee hours of the morning?\u201d</p><p>\nSpider-Man\nseemed very interested in his feet again, and you found yourself\nhaving trouble believing what Ned said about the rumored Avenger&rsquo;s\nhabit of giving women gifts. The lean, muscular hero looked a bit\nlike an overwhelmed puppy in a costume right now. He didn&rsquo;t answer\nyour question, he just shrugged. You could still see the smile\nunderneath the mask.</p><p>\n\u201cWell,\nuh, I&rsquo;d better get going,\u201d he said suddenly, seeming to come back\nto himself a bit. He motioned over his shoulder toward the faint\nsound of sirens in the distance. \u201cSorry about waking you up.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNo,\nno, it&rsquo;s okay,\u201d you said quickly, stopping yourself from reaching\nfor him. His announcement of his soon-to-be exit made you realize\njust how badly you didn&rsquo;t want him to go just yet. \u201cCome wake me up\nanytime. Who needs sleep anyway?\u201d</p><p>\nHe\nseemed to laugh to himself, launching into a crouch on your\nguardrail. You were amazed that he could effortlessly balance on such\na thin piece of metal. He turned his head back toward you.</p><p>\n\u201cGoodnight,\nY/N,\u201d he said quietly. Then, as quickly as he appeared, he was gone\nin a blur of webs, red, and blue.</p><p>\n\u201cGoodnight,\nSpider-Man,\u201d you smiled to yourself.</p><p>\nYou\nhadn&rsquo;t fallen back asleep until two hours before you woke up for\nschool, your mind racing with what Spider-Man&rsquo;s visit meant. Had he\nreally come to check on you because he cared about you, or did he\nfeel obligated to play messenger for his elusive friend at Midtown?\nWas it some strange combination of both? Your heart swelled as you\nthought about his sweet demeanor and floor-drawn eyes. Did you make\nSpider-Man blush? Not that you&rsquo;d know with that mask.</p><p>\nYour\nheart fluttered as you awoke, the events of the previous night\nreplaying in your head like a constantly-rewinding tape. You wondered\nif he would visit you again. You certainly hoped so.</p><hr><p>\nYour\nbrave decision to confront Peter Parker about his bizarre behavior\ntoward you dwindled away, along with your courage, as the day passed.\nYou&rsquo;d seen Ned a handful of times from across the hall that day, and\nhe had smiled at you as if absolutely nothing was out of the\nordinary; this confused you more. He even stopped to talk to you\nonce, explaining how he and Peter would be missing lunch to put the\nfinishing touches on their project for robotics class. You nodded,\nunsure of how to interpret his sudden warmth. Was Ned the friend that\nSpider-Man had been apologizing for?</p><p>\nThe\nstudent body found you no less interesting than they had the day\nbefore, a particular group of jocks whistling at you in the hallways,\njust like yesterday. You blushed and kept walking, gripping on to\nyour backpack straps a bit more tightly.</p><p>\nChemistry\nwas your final class of the day, and you were thankful that your\napartment was only an hour and thirty minutes away from your grasp.\nYou&rsquo;d forgotten to bring your lunch to school that day, the result\nbeing a suspicious-looking 'pizza&rsquo; and sitting in a girls&rsquo; bathroom\nstall to eat it. With Ned not at lunch, you were terrified of the\nstares you&rsquo;d receive by sitting alone. Eating lunch alone, in\nprivate, was 1,000 times better than eating your lunch alone in\npublic. The day had almost been worse than yesterday, and you sighed\nin relief as you stepped into the Chemistry classroom. You could\ntaste the anticipation of the final period of the day in the air. It\ntasted like freedom.</p><p>\nThe\nbell rang to start class, and just before the teacher closed the\nclassroom door, rushing in came none other than a disheveled Peter\nParker. The teacher eyed him a bit scornfully but said nothing, his\nmouth pursed in a straight line as he closed the door behind Peter.\n\u201cNot technically late,\u201d you thought you heard Peter mumble to him\nhopefully.</p><p>\nPeter\npower-walked to a seat in the back of the classroom at a lab table\ncovered in papers, keeping his head down.</p><p>\n\u201cNow,\u201d\nyour professor began, picking up a piece of chalk and turning to\nwrite on the board, \u201cwe are going to continue our discussion of\natoms and what environmental factors influence their behavior. I have\ndecided to delegate a bit of partner work \u2014 I know that it&rsquo;s Friday\nand we are all eager to get home. There are 24 of you in here, so\npair up.\u201d He wrote out a few multipart questions for you all to\ncopy. \u201cI don&rsquo;t care with who, but pick a partner and get to work.\nThe faster you get done, the faster we can all get outta here. How&rsquo;s\nthat?\u201d</p><p>\nYour\nclassmates smiled and hummed in agreement. You had to concur. The\nfaster today was over with, the better. But then anxiety slammed into\nyou like a speeding truck on a highway. You didn&rsquo;t know anyone in\nthis classroom. Well, the only person you <i>had</i> met was Peter,\nand you were sure that he would rather work with anyone<i> but</i>\nyou. With hopeless eyes, you turned toward the rest of the classroom\nas chairs started to scrape and backpacks began being stuffed,\nstudents finding their friends and moving about the classroom to join\nthem. This was going to be embarrassing.</p><p>\nAs\nyou prepared yourself to stand up and start aimlessly wandering\naround the room so that you didn&rsquo;t look so pitiful and alone, you\nheard the loud scrape of a stool behind you. You turned to find Peter\nParker sliding into the seat next to you at your lab table with a\ncautious smile, as if afraid you were going to bite him for coming\ntoo close. You were positive that the shock was showing on your face.</p><p>\n\u201cUm,\nhi, I&rsquo;m Peter,\u201d he said softly, as if you&rsquo;d run any minute. He\nhesitantly extended his hand to shake yours, a hopeful yet guilty\nlook in his brown eyes. \u201cPeter Parker. My buddy Ned introduced us\nat lunch yesterday?\u201d</p><p>\nYou\nstared at his hand for a moment, almost rudely, but then caught\nyourself. You shook it back. His grip was surprisingly strong and\nfirm. His hand was warm.</p><p>\n\u201cYeah,\nI remember you,\u201d you said, eyes a bit narrowed. You were tempted to\nchew him out for his rude departure, but you bit your tongue. \u201cYou,\nuh, had to run off?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYeah,\u201d\nhe breathed, almost in an exhausted way, \u201cI&hellip; had something come\nup.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNed\nsaid you had an internship with Tony Stark?\u201d you questioned, hoping\nto gauge his reaction to this information as truthful or not. His\neyes widened.</p><p>\n\u201cYeah,\nI have since last year,\u201d he said, and you almost felt the wave of\nrelief flood through him. \u201cIt&rsquo;s super crazy. Mr. Stark has me\ndoing&hellip; <i>all kinds</i> of stuff for him.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWorking\nfor Iron Man has to be pretty awesome,\u201d you said lightly, taking\nthe handouts that were being passed around the room. \u201cI bet you get\naccess to all kinds of cool tech, huh?\u201d</p><p>\nPeter\nsmiled, and you tried to hold back your own. He was quite attractive\nto you, and keeping your blush at bay was priority Defcon One. How\ndid you go from being angry with him two minutes ago to beating down\nthe butterflies in your stomach the next?</p><p>\n\u201cYeah,\nit <i>is</i> pretty cool,\u201d he conceded, shrugging his shoulders\nmodestly. He turned his stool toward you, his entire body facing you\nnow. \u201cYou&rsquo;re Y/N, right?\u201d \n</p><p>\nYou\nturned your entire body toward him as well, not able to stop your\ngenuine grin. Something about him felt familiar, but you couldn&rsquo;t\nquite put your finger on it. You tried to deny how much you liked the\nsound of your name coming from his mouth, but when he met your\naffirming nod with a sweet smile, you knew denial was pointless. You\nhad a crush.</p><p>\n\u201cHey,\nso, this might sound kinda weird,\u201d he started, scratching the back\nof his neck nervously. The movement caught your eye, \u201cbut running\naway like that at lunch yesterday wasn&rsquo;t cool of me to do. I didn&rsquo;t\nmean to&hellip; make you think that I didn&rsquo;t want to meet you or\nanything&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\nYour\neyes narrowed further, and you tilted your head to the side,\nobserving him. Peter looked downright nervous. He ran a hand through\nhis thick chocolate waves.</p><p>\n\u201cDo\nyou&hellip; do you happen to have a friend that makes a habit of swinging\nby people&rsquo;s apartments at 2:30 in the morning?\u201d you ask curiously,\na lazy smile tugging at the corner of your pink lips. Peter gulped\nand his eyes widened just the smallest bit.</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2014I\ndon&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about,\u201d he said. His hands were\nwringing underneath the table and you definitely noticed.</p><p>\n\u201cSo\nyou&rsquo;re <i>not</i> friends with Spider-Man?\u201d you clarified, smirking\na little. His face was the only answer that you really needed. Poor\nPeter was an open book.</p><p>\n\u201cI\nmean,\u201d he started, observing your knowing look and stuttering, \u201cI\nmight&rsquo;ve met the guy a <i>few</i> times. He&hellip; he s-saved my friends.\nIn an elevator. Last year. In Washington D.C.\u201d</p><p>\nYou\ngrinned, concluding without a doubt that Peter was on the other side\nof Spider-Man&rsquo;s awkward apologies. Peter smiled back at you, his\nchocolate eyes crinkling at the corners. Any anger or resentment you\nmay have harbored toward Peter was obliterated in that moment.</p><p>\n\u201cGet\nworking!\u201d called your teacher suddenly, making the whole class look\nup from their conversations to pick up their beakers and appropriate\nforms.</p><p>\nPeter\nfollowed the teacher&rsquo;s instructions, but had a subtle smile pulling\nat the corner of his lips as he organized your supplies.</p><p>\n\u201cSo,\nI&rsquo;m guessing that Spider-Man told you about our little run-in two\nnights ago?\u201d you asked, handing \u00a0Peter a copy of your handout. His\neyebrows rose in question. \u201cI mean, you sent the poor guy to my\napartment at 2:00 AM this morning.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOh,\nyeah, he mentioned you,\u201d Peter agreed suddenly, turning on the\nBunsen Burner with caution. \u201cYa know, uh&hellip; he just told me about\nthe guy who was trying to hurt you. Your\u2014your name came up and he\nsaid it was your first night in New York&hellip; so I thought we had to be\ntalking about the same person.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhy\ndidn&rsquo;t you just wait to talk to me today?\u201d you asked, picking up a\nsmall bottle filled with white powder and turning it around in your\nhands. Your confused look caused Peter to hold out his hand, a small\nsmile still playing at his lips. You placed the bottle in his palm,\ntrying to ignore the spark of butterflies in your stomach when your\nfingers brushed his.</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2014I\ndon&rsquo;t know,\u201d Peter said, his voice small and a bit embarrassed.\n\u201cMaybe I thought you&rsquo;d take it better from him, from Spider-Man.\nHe&rsquo;s kinda a cool guy, you know? Not <i>kinda</i> cool, but you know,\n<i>really </i>cool.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cHe\nis pretty awesome,\u201d you grinned at Peter&rsquo;s fanboying. \u201cYou know,\nhe has these super cool tiny lenses that make up the eyes on his\nmask?\u201d</p><p>\nPeter\nturned to you, his look some combination of astonishment and another\nemotion you couldn&rsquo;t quite place.</p><p>\n\u201cI,\nuh, I never noticed,\u201d he said, clearing his throat.</p><p>\n\u201cYeah,\nI noticed them the other night,\u201d you continued, fangirling a bit.\n\u201cHis suit was really neat, his eyes kind of do this auto-focus\nthing. I wonder where he got it\u2014maybe he made it? I don&rsquo;t know, it\nseems kinda high-tech.\u201d</p><p>\nPeter\nhanded you a pair of protective eyeglasses, clearing his throat\nagain. He placed his own over his eyes, suddenly very interested in\nadjusting the flame of the Bunsen Burner just so.</p><p>\n\u201cWho\nknows?\u201d Peter shrugged dismissively. \u201cHey, do you mind handing me\nthe sodium polyacrylate?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThe\nwhat?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThe\nlittle bottle next to your notebook,\u201d he said, trying to hide his\nsmile.</p><p>\n\u201cYeah,\nyeah, sure,\u201d you nod quickly, handing him the aforementioned\nchemical. Peter obviously knew what he was doing, and you very\nobviously did not. \u201cSorry, I won&rsquo;t be too great of a partner&hellip; I\ndon&rsquo;t really get any of this.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNo,\nit&rsquo;s okay,\u201d Peter said quickly, stopping just before he poured a\nbit of the sodium whatever-it&rsquo;s-called into the boiling beaker to\nlook at you. \u201cYou came in right as we were finishing up the unit. I\ndon&rsquo;t think anybody would know what was going on.\u201d</p><p>\nYou\nlooked around the classroom, and only one other table looked remotely\ncompetent. Everyone else seemed to have just as much of an idea of\nwhat they were supposed to do as you did. You thanked your lucky\nstars that Peter was your partner, and not only because you found him\ncute. Ned did say that Peter was 'wicked smart&rsquo;, and you were sure\nhis skills in chemistry were just the tip of the iceberg. After all,\nhe had an internship with <i>Tony Stark\u2014</i>someone has to be\ngenius-level smart for that, right?</p><p>\n\u201cI\ndon&rsquo;t think anyone really knows what they&rsquo;re doing,\u201d you commented\nwith an air of relief. \u201cThanks for coming to sit with me, or I&rsquo;d\nstill be trying to light the Bunsen Burner right about now.\u201d</p><p>\nPeter&rsquo;s\neyes darted from the beaker to you, but only for a moment, before\nreturning to his task. One corner of his mouth pulled up, ever so\nslightly. For whatever reason, the expression made the butterflies in\nyour stomach dance.</p><p>\n\u201cYeah,\nyeah, no problem,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, after running off yesterday\nit&rsquo;s the least I could do.\u201d</p><p>\nYou\nboth worked in comfortable silence after that, occasionally making\ncomments and asking questions back and forth, mostly related to the\nassignment. You both reached for a pencil at the same time and\nbrushed fingers again, sending your heart into a frenzy. His cheeks\nwere tinted pink for a moment after that, and you hoped it was for\nthe same reason yours were, and not from the heat of the Bunsen\nBurner.</p><p>\nBefore\nyou knew it, you were quite literally saved by the bell, and students\ngrabbed their backpacks and booked it out of the classroom for the\nweekend. You were still gathering your books, and to your pleasant\nsurprise, Peter waited on you, his backpack thrown over one shoulder\nand a hand in the pocket of his jeans.</p><p>\n\u201cOh,\nyou don&rsquo;t have to wait on me,\u201d you said quickly, letting your hair\nfall over your face as you organized some loose pages in your binder.\nYour cheeks felt a little hot again and you didn&rsquo;t want Peter to\nnotice.</p><p>\n\u201cI\nknow,\u201d Peter said simply, a kind smile on his handsome face. \u201cI\nthought maybe you&rsquo;d want someone to walk to the bus stop with? Or\u2014or\nnot, that&rsquo;s cool, too.\u201d He was scratching the back of his neck\nagain. It must be a nervous habit.</p><p>\n\u201cI&rsquo;d\nlove that, actually,\u201d you reassured him, flashing him a brilliant\nsmile. He smiled back at you and his cheeks were tinted pink again.\nAnd there went your damn butterflies.</p><p>\nAs\nyou walked to the bus stop, Ned met up with the two of you, a\nshit-eating grin on his face. It was apparent that Peter apologizing\nto you in Chemistry had been a plan between the two of them, and Ned\nwas happy to see that it came to fruition.</p><p>\nBut\nthe smiles and occasional laughter were short-lived. \n</p><p>\nYou\nfroze. Ned and Peter&rsquo;s eyes followed yours, landing on the thin\nfigure of your mother, leaning against a black car. Her eyes were red\nand swollen, all color drained from her face. Your heart dropped into\nyour stomach like a bomb.</p><p>\nSomething\nwas wrong.</p><p>\nYou\nlooked back at Ned and Peter apologetically with panic in your eyes.\nYou ran to your mother, immediately demanding to know what was going\non.</p><p>\n\u201cBaby,\u201d\nshe whispered, clutching your shoulders in what you assumed was meant\nto be a comforting fashion, but it was more like she was holding on\nfor dear life, \u201cat your dad&rsquo;s work&hellip; there was an accident.\u201d</p><p>\nIn\na single moment, your world crumbled.</p><p><b><a href=\"http://loveissupernatural.tumblr.com/post/177006987816/the-man-behind-the-mask-pt-4-peter-parker-x\">Pt 4</a></b></p>",

You held your\nbreath, and in what seemed like slow motion, your fingers closed\naround the rough fabric.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\nAll\nat once, you swung open the curtains, knife wielded in your firm\ngrasp, ready to defend yourself the moment it was necessary. You were\nmet with large white eyes that made you yelp, dropping the knife onto\nthe soft carpet of your bedroom as you stumbled back, hand clutched\nover your frantic heart. The muscle was trying to bust out of the\nprison of your rib cage and escape, as if was frightened itself. \n</p><p>\n\u201cWhoa,\nwhoa, whoa, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d came a frantic familiar voice, red hands\npressed against the glass in a concerned way. You threw your head\nback and sighed in relief, hand still grasping at your chest. It was\njust Spider-Man.</p><p>\nWait.\nIt was Spider-Man.</p><p>\n\u201cWhat\n\u2013 what are you doing here?\u201d you demanded in disbelief. \u201cWhat\ntime is it?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWell,\nI was just out, ya know, patrolling the city, and I \u2013 hey, could\nyou maybe open the window?\u201d he asked a little squeamishly, pointing\nto the closed latches on your windowsill. His large white eyes\nwidened innocently.</p><p>\nYou\nsighed exasperatedly at the scare he gave you, coming forward to do\nas he asked. You slowly lifted the bottom half of your window to\nallow in the chilly night breeze, Spider-Man standing back on your\nfire escape with his hands grasped together in an almost-ashamed way.\nIt was an odd oxymoron to see a hero so graceful standing there\nlooking so very awkward.</p><p>\n\u201cUm,\u201d\nyou began, arms crossed over your chest; you were suddenly painfully\naware of the bra you were lacking, \u201cwhat\u2014what\u2019s up, Spider-Man?\u201d\nThe words felt so surreal falling from your lips. The \u00a0retreating\nmelatonin, rushing adrenaline, and surprise mixing in your veins was\nquite the heady combination.</p><p>\nTo\nyour adding surprise, he looked even more awkward, staring at his\nfeet.</p><p>\n\u201cLike\nI said, I was just swinging around Queens, keeping an eye on stuff,\nya know?\u201d he shrugged, scratching at the back of his neck where you\nassumed his mask met his suit. \u201cAnd I was already in the\nneighborhood and thought, hey, I wonder how Y/N\u2019s doing?\u201d</p><p>\nYour\neyebrows rose. \u201cUm, wow\u2026 thanks for coming by, but I\u2019m doing\nfine. Keeping myself distracted with school and stuff.\u201d He nodded\nand clasped his hands behind his back, looking at his feet once\nagain. Your brows furrowed. \u201cWas there something else\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cDid\nyou, uh, get my apple?\u201d he asked, looking up at you. The large\nwhite eyes somehow seemed hopeful. His kind voice certainly was. You\ncouldn\u2019t stop the embarrassingly large grin that stretched across\nyour face.</p><p>\n\u201cUm,\nyeah. Yeah, I did,\u201d you replied, hoping he could tell how thankful\nyou were for his thoughtfulness. \u201cThat was\u2026 so sweet. You didn\u2019t\nhave to do that.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI\ntold you I\u2019d walk you home \u2013 more or less,\u201d he shrugged, bashful.\nYou smiled even bigger. \u201cSo, uh\u2026 how was your first full day in\nNew York?\u201d</p><p>\nYour\nsmile reached your eyes as you looked at him, almost shaking your\nhead in disbelief. Spider-Man was here, on your fire escape, in the\nearly hours of the morning, checking on you and asking you about your\nfirst day. You had another \u2018Is this your life?\u2019 moment.</p><p>\n\u201cIt\nwas okay, I guess,\u201d you laughed, your tone making your amusement at\nhis interest in you apparent. \u201cI went to my new school yesterday.\nKinda scary, a lot bigger than what I\u2019m used to.\u201d You stifled a\nyawn.</p><p>\n\u201cOh,\nokay, cool,\u201d he nodded, shifting his weight back and forth onto his\nright foot, then his left. He looked like he desperately wanted\nsomething, but what, you couldn\u2019t tell.</p><p>\n\u201cLook,\nI cannot put into words how much I appreciate you coming by, even\nthough you almost made me pee my pants,\u201d you chuckled, trying to\nkeep your tone light, \u201cbut what are you doing here, really?\u201d</p><p>\nHe\nsighed, and you imagined him biting his lip.</p><p>\n\u201cYou\nhave to promise not to ask any questions, okay? Because I can\u2019t tell\nyou anything.\u201d</p><p>\nYour\ninterest instantly piqued, you carefully climbed out of the window to\nmeet him on the fire escape. You kept your arms crossed to guard your\nbra-less chest against the cold New York wind. You sat on your\nwindowsill, trying to appear relaxed and friendly as you gave him an\nencouraging smile.</p><p>\n\u201cI\ndon\u2019t really know what all of this is about, but I promise,\u201d you\nsaid. Spider-Man crossed his arms as well and leaned against your\nrailing, crossing one ankle over the other. He stood out in an almost\nethereal way against the black night sky and the glowing lights of\nQueens below.</p><p>\n\u201cLet\u2019s\njust say that\u2026 I know a guy at Midtown High,\u201d he began\nhesitantly, and your brows automatically pulled together, \u201cand he\nfeels really awful about how he treated you at school yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\nYour\nmind instantly flashed to Peter Parker, or was it Ned? Was it maybe\none of the assholes who catcalled you throughout the day?</p><p>\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nyou asked, almost as if you didn\u2019t hear him correctly. What was he\ntelling you? That he is friends with Ned and Peter, or one of the\njerks that liked to ogle you from across the room? Did <i>he</i> go\nto Midtown High? Could Spider-Man really be that young? He <i>sounded</i>\nyoung.</p><p>\n\u201cYou\nsaid you wouldn\u2019t ask any questions,\u201d he reminded you, almost in a\npanicked way. His hands were held out in front of him as if they\nwould physically block the questions in your gaze and coming out of\nyour mouth.</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2014I\nknow,\u201d you said, trying to think of a way to phrase what you wanted\nto know without it technically asking something. \u201cNot asking a\nquestion\u2014but you\u2019re gonna have to clarify who feels awful. I had a\nfew incidents yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\nDid\nSpider-Man look <i>guilty</i>? Surely not, but you didn\u2019t know how\nelse to describe his hung head and lack of eye contact. He seemed\nincredibly uncomfortable. Well, it <i>did</i> suck having to play the\nmessenger between two parties, you reminded yourself.</p><p>\n\u201cNot\na good first day?\u201d he asked, and he sounded like he wanted to punch\nhimself in the face.</p><p>\n\u201cSome\nguys are assholes,\u201d you said simply, tone still light. \u201cLook, you\ndon\u2019t have to play intermediary for whoever it is. They can apologize\nthemselves, you know.\u201d</p><p>\nHe\nsighed heavily, his shoulders slumping with it. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\nI\u2019ll, uh, I\u2019ll let him know. But he does feel like a total jerk.\u201d</p><p>\nYou\nsquinted at him and tilted your head to the side, trying to somehow\nlook past his lensed white eyes and into his mind. He looked back,\nhis mask unusually inexpressive: a perfect poker face. The air was\ntense.</p><p>\n\u201cHe\ndoes?\u201d you asked, but it sounded more like a statement than a\nquestion. \n</p><p>\nSpider-Man\nnodded earnestly. \n</p><p>\nUncrossing\nyour arms, you stood up from your position on the windowsill and\nstepped closer to the guy who saved your life, twice. You smiled at\nhim. He stopped leaning against your rail and stood up as well, a\nfull head taller than you. You craned your neck a bit to look into\nthe eyes of his mask.</p><p>\n\u201cEnough\nabout me,\u201d you smiled softly, \u201cwhat about you? How was <i>your</i>\nday, Spidey?\u201d</p><p>\nHe\nchuckled a bit uneasily, and his hand started rubbing the back of his\nneck again. You could see him smiling underneath the mask, and if you\ndidn\u2019t know better, you\u2019d say he seemed a bit flustered.</p><p>\n\u201cOh,\nyou know, the usual,\u201d he said, and you were overwhelmed by fondness\nfor his apparent bashfulness. \u201cStopped a homeless guy from breaking\ninto an ATM a few blocks away, walked an old lady home who forgot\nwhere she lived \u2013 again. Stopped by to check on this girl\u2026\u201d</p><p>\nYou\nlaughed. \u201cLucky her. Do you stop by and wake up all the girls you\nsave in the wee hours of the morning?\u201d</p><p>\nSpider-Man\nseemed very interested in his feet again, and you found yourself\nhaving trouble believing what Ned said about the rumored Avenger\u2019s\nhabit of giving women gifts. The lean, muscular hero looked a bit\nlike an overwhelmed puppy in a costume right now. He didn\u2019t answer\nyour question, he just shrugged. You could still see the smile\nunderneath the mask.</p><p>\n\u201cWell,\nuh, I\u2019d better get going,\u201d he said suddenly, seeming to come back\nto himself a bit. He motioned over his shoulder toward the faint\nsound of sirens in the distance. \u201cSorry about waking you up.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNo,\nno, it\u2019s okay,\u201d you said quickly, stopping yourself from reaching\nfor him. His announcement of his soon-to-be exit made you realize\njust how badly you didn\u2019t want him to go just yet. \u201cCome wake me up\nanytime. Who needs sleep anyway?\u201d</p><p>\nHe\nseemed to laugh to himself, launching into a crouch on your\nguardrail. You were amazed that he could effortlessly balance on such\na thin piece of metal. He turned his head back toward you.</p><p>\n\u201cGoodnight,\nY/N,\u201d he said quietly. Then, as quickly as he appeared, he was gone\nin a blur of webs, red, and blue.</p><p>\n\u201cGoodnight,\nSpider-Man,\u201d you smiled to yourself.</p><p>\nYou\nhadn\u2019t fallen back asleep until two hours before you woke up for\nschool, your mind racing with what Spider-Man\u2019s visit meant. Had he\nreally come to check on you because he cared about you, or did he\nfeel obligated to play messenger for his elusive friend at Midtown?\nWas it some strange combination of both? Your heart swelled as you\nthought about his sweet demeanor and floor-drawn eyes. Did you make\nSpider-Man blush? Not that you\u2019d know with that mask.</p><p>\nYour\nheart fluttered as you awoke, the events of the previous night\nreplaying in your head like a constantly-rewinding tape. You wondered\nif he would visit you again. You certainly hoped so.</p><hr><p>\nYour\nbrave decision to confront Peter Parker about his bizarre behavior\ntoward you dwindled away, along with your courage, as the day passed.\nYou\u2019d seen Ned a handful of times from across the hall that day, and\nhe had smiled at you as if absolutely nothing was out of the\nordinary; this confused you more. He even stopped to talk to you\nonce, explaining how he and Peter would be missing lunch to put the\nfinishing touches on their project for robotics class. You nodded,\nunsure of how to interpret his sudden warmth. Was Ned the friend that\nSpider-Man had been apologizing for?</p><p>\nThe\nstudent body found you no less interesting than they had the day\nbefore, a particular group of jocks whistling at you in the hallways,\njust like yesterday. You blushed and kept walking, gripping on to\nyour backpack straps a bit more tightly.</p><p>\nChemistry\nwas your final class of the day, and you were thankful that your\napartment was only an hour and thirty minutes away from your grasp.\nYou\u2019d forgotten to bring your lunch to school that day, the result\nbeing a suspicious-looking 'pizza\u2019 and sitting in a girls\u2019 bathroom\nstall to eat it. With Ned not at lunch, you were terrified of the\nstares you\u2019d receive by sitting alone. Eating lunch alone, in\nprivate, was 1,000 times better than eating your lunch alone in\npublic. The day had almost been worse than yesterday, and you sighed\nin relief as you stepped into the Chemistry classroom. You could\ntaste the anticipation of the final period of the day in the air. It\ntasted like freedom.</p><p>\nThe\nbell rang to start class, and just before the teacher closed the\nclassroom door, rushing in came none other than a disheveled Peter\nParker. The teacher eyed him a bit scornfully but said nothing, his\nmouth pursed in a straight line as he closed the door behind Peter.\n\u201cNot technically late,\u201d you thought you heard Peter mumble to him\nhopefully.</p><p>\nPeter\npower-walked to a seat in the back of the classroom at a lab table\ncovered in papers, keeping his head down.</p><p>\n\u201cNow,\u201d\nyour professor began, picking up a piece of chalk and turning to\nwrite on the board, \u201cwe are going to continue our discussion of\natoms and what environmental factors influence their behavior. I have\ndecided to delegate a bit of partner work \u2014 I know that it\u2019s Friday\nand we are all eager to get home. There are 24 of you in here, so\npair up.\u201d He wrote out a few multipart questions for you all to\ncopy. \u201cI don\u2019t care with who, but pick a partner and get to work.\nThe faster you get done, the faster we can all get outta here. How\u2019s\nthat?\u201d</p><p>\nYour\nclassmates smiled and hummed in agreement. You had to concur. The\nfaster today was over with, the better. But then anxiety slammed into\nyou like a speeding truck on a highway. You didn\u2019t know anyone in\nthis classroom. Well, the only person you <i>had</i> met was Peter,\nand you were sure that he would rather work with anyone<i> but</i>\nyou. With hopeless eyes, you turned toward the rest of the classroom\nas chairs started to scrape and backpacks began being stuffed,\nstudents finding their friends and moving about the classroom to join\nthem. This was going to be embarrassing.</p><p>\nAs\nyou prepared yourself to stand up and start aimlessly wandering\naround the room so that you didn\u2019t look so pitiful and alone, you\nheard the loud scrape of a stool behind you. You turned to find Peter\nParker sliding into the seat next to you at your lab table with a\ncautious smile, as if afraid you were going to bite him for coming\ntoo close. You were positive that the shock was showing on your face.</p><p>\n\u201cUm,\nhi, I\u2019m Peter,\u201d he said softly, as if you\u2019d run any minute. He\nhesitantly extended his hand to shake yours, a hopeful yet guilty\nlook in his brown eyes. \u201cPeter Parker. My buddy Ned introduced us\nat lunch yesterday?\u201d</p><p>\nYou\nstared at his hand for a moment, almost rudely, but then caught\nyourself. You shook it back. His grip was surprisingly strong and\nfirm. His hand was warm.</p><p>\n\u201cYeah,\nI remember you,\u201d you said, eyes a bit narrowed. You were tempted to\nchew him out for his rude departure, but you bit your tongue. \u201cYou,\nuh, had to run off?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYeah,\u201d\nhe breathed, almost in an exhausted way, \u201cI\u2026 had something come\nup.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNed\nsaid you had an internship with Tony Stark?\u201d you questioned, hoping\nto gauge his reaction to this information as truthful or not. His\neyes widened.</p><p>\n\u201cYeah,\nI have since last year,\u201d he said, and you almost felt the wave of\nrelief flood through him. \u201cIt\u2019s super crazy. Mr. Stark has me\ndoing\u2026 <i>all kinds</i> of stuff for him.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWorking\nfor Iron Man has to be pretty awesome,\u201d you said lightly, taking\nthe handouts that were being passed around the room. \u201cI bet you get\naccess to all kinds of cool tech, huh?\u201d</p><p>\nPeter\nsmiled, and you tried to hold back your own. He was quite attractive\nto you, and keeping your blush at bay was priority Defcon One. How\ndid you go from being angry with him two minutes ago to beating down\nthe butterflies in your stomach the next?</p><p>\n\u201cYeah,\nit <i>is</i> pretty cool,\u201d he conceded, shrugging his shoulders\nmodestly. He turned his stool toward you, his entire body facing you\nnow. \u201cYou\u2019re Y/N, right?\u201d \n</p><p>\nYou\nturned your entire body toward him as well, not able to stop your\ngenuine grin. Something about him felt familiar, but you couldn\u2019t\nquite put your finger on it. You tried to deny how much you liked the\nsound of your name coming from his mouth, but when he met your\naffirming nod with a sweet smile, you knew denial was pointless. You\nhad a crush.</p><p>\n\u201cHey,\nso, this might sound kinda weird,\u201d he started, scratching the back\nof his neck nervously. The movement caught your eye, \u201cbut running\naway like that at lunch yesterday wasn\u2019t cool of me to do. I didn\u2019t\nmean to\u2026 make you think that I didn\u2019t want to meet you or\nanything\u2026\u201d</p><p>\nYour\neyes narrowed further, and you tilted your head to the side,\nobserving him. Peter looked downright nervous. He ran a hand through\nhis thick chocolate waves.</p><p>\n\u201cDo\nyou\u2026 do you happen to have a friend that makes a habit of swinging\nby people\u2019s apartments at 2:30 in the morning?\u201d you ask curiously,\na lazy smile tugging at the corner of your pink lips. Peter gulped\nand his eyes widened just the smallest bit.</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2014I\ndon\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d he said. His hands were\nwringing underneath the table and you definitely noticed.</p><p>\n\u201cSo\nyou\u2019re <i>not</i> friends with Spider-Man?\u201d you clarified, smirking\na little. His face was the only answer that you really needed. Poor\nPeter was an open book.</p><p>\n\u201cI\nmean,\u201d he started, observing your knowing look and stuttering, \u201cI\nmight\u2019ve met the guy a <i>few</i> times. He\u2026 he s-saved my friends.\nIn an elevator. Last year. In Washington D.C.\u201d</p><p>\nYou\ngrinned, concluding without a doubt that Peter was on the other side\nof Spider-Man\u2019s awkward apologies. Peter smiled back at you, his\nchocolate eyes crinkling at the corners. Any anger or resentment you\nmay have harbored toward Peter was obliterated in that moment.</p><p>\n\u201cGet\nworking!\u201d called your teacher suddenly, making the whole class look\nup from their conversations to pick up their beakers and appropriate\nforms.</p><p>\nPeter\nfollowed the teacher\u2019s instructions, but had a subtle smile pulling\nat the corner of his lips as he organized your supplies.</p><p>\n\u201cSo,\nI\u2019m guessing that Spider-Man told you about our little run-in two\nnights ago?\u201d you asked, handing \u00a0Peter a copy of your handout. His\neyebrows rose in question. \u201cI mean, you sent the poor guy to my\napartment at 2:00 AM this morning.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOh,\nyeah, he mentioned you,\u201d Peter agreed suddenly, turning on the\nBunsen Burner with caution. \u201cYa know, uh\u2026 he just told me about\nthe guy who was trying to hurt you. Your\u2014your name came up and he\nsaid it was your first night in New York\u2026 so I thought we had to be\ntalking about the same person.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhy\ndidn\u2019t you just wait to talk to me today?\u201d you asked, picking up a\nsmall bottle filled with white powder and turning it around in your\nhands. Your confused look caused Peter to hold out his hand, a small\nsmile still playing at his lips. You placed the bottle in his palm,\ntrying to ignore the spark of butterflies in your stomach when your\nfingers brushed his.</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2014I\ndon\u2019t know,\u201d Peter said, his voice small and a bit embarrassed.\n\u201cMaybe I thought you\u2019d take it better from him, from Spider-Man.\nHe\u2019s kinda a cool guy, you know? Not <i>kinda</i> cool, but you know,\n<i>really </i>cool.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cHe\nis pretty awesome,\u201d you grinned at Peter\u2019s fanboying. \u201cYou know,\nhe has these super cool tiny lenses that make up the eyes on his\nmask?\u201d</p><p>\nPeter\nturned to you, his look some combination of astonishment and another\nemotion you couldn\u2019t quite place.</p><p>\n\u201cI,\nuh, I never noticed,\u201d he said, clearing his throat.</p><p>\n\u201cYeah,\nI noticed them the other night,\u201d you continued, fangirling a bit.\n\u201cHis suit was really neat, his eyes kind of do this auto-focus\nthing. I wonder where he got it\u2014maybe he made it? I don\u2019t know, it\nseems kinda high-tech.\u201d</p><p>\nPeter\nhanded you a pair of protective eyeglasses, clearing his throat\nagain. He placed his own over his eyes, suddenly very interested in\nadjusting the flame of the Bunsen Burner just so.</p><p>\n\u201cWho\nknows?\u201d Peter shrugged dismissively. \u201cHey, do you mind handing me\nthe sodium polyacrylate?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThe\nwhat?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThe\nlittle bottle next to your notebook,\u201d he said, trying to hide his\nsmile.</p><p>\n\u201cYeah,\nyeah, sure,\u201d you nod quickly, handing him the aforementioned\nchemical. Peter obviously knew what he was doing, and you very\nobviously did not. \u201cSorry, I won\u2019t be too great of a partner\u2026 I\ndon\u2019t really get any of this.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNo,\nit\u2019s okay,\u201d Peter said quickly, stopping just before he poured a\nbit of the sodium whatever-it\u2019s-called into the boiling beaker to\nlook at you. \u201cYou came in right as we were finishing up the unit. I\ndon\u2019t think anybody would know what was going on.\u201d</p><p>\nYou\nlooked around the classroom, and only one other table looked remotely\ncompetent. Everyone else seemed to have just as much of an idea of\nwhat they were supposed to do as you did. You thanked your lucky\nstars that Peter was your partner, and not only because you found him\ncute. Ned did say that Peter was 'wicked smart\u2019, and you were sure\nhis skills in chemistry were just the tip of the iceberg. After all,\nhe had an internship with <i>Tony Stark\u2014</i>someone has to be\ngenius-level smart for that, right?</p><p>\n\u201cI\ndon\u2019t think anyone really knows what they\u2019re doing,\u201d you commented\nwith an air of relief. \u201cThanks for coming to sit with me, or I\u2019d\nstill be trying to light the Bunsen Burner right about now.\u201d</p><p>\nPeter\u2019s\neyes darted from the beaker to you, but only for a moment, before\nreturning to his task. One corner of his mouth pulled up, ever so\nslightly. For whatever reason, the expression made the butterflies in\nyour stomach dance.</p><p>\n\u201cYeah,\nyeah, no problem,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, after running off yesterday\nit\u2019s the least I could do.\u201d</p><p>\nYou\nboth worked in comfortable silence after that, occasionally making\ncomments and asking questions back and forth, mostly related to the\nassignment. You both reached for a pencil at the same time and\nbrushed fingers again, sending your heart into a frenzy. His cheeks\nwere tinted pink for a moment after that, and you hoped it was for\nthe same reason yours were, and not from the heat of the Bunsen\nBurner.</p><p>\nBefore\nyou knew it, you were quite literally saved by the bell, and students\ngrabbed their backpacks and booked it out of the classroom for the\nweekend. You were still gathering your books, and to your pleasant\nsurprise, Peter waited on you, his backpack thrown over one shoulder\nand a hand in the pocket of his jeans.</p><p>\n\u201cOh,\nyou don\u2019t have to wait on me,\u201d you said quickly, letting your hair\nfall over your face as you organized some loose pages in your binder.\nYour cheeks felt a little hot again and you didn\u2019t want Peter to\nnotice.</p><p>\n\u201cI\nknow,\u201d Peter said simply, a kind smile on his handsome face. \u201cI\nthought maybe you\u2019d want someone to walk to the bus stop with? Or\u2014or\nnot, that\u2019s cool, too.\u201d He was scratching the back of his neck\nagain. It must be a nervous habit.</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019d\nlove that, actually,\u201d you reassured him, flashing him a brilliant\nsmile. He smiled back at you and his cheeks were tinted pink again.\nAnd there went your damn butterflies.</p><p>\nAs\nyou walked to the bus stop, Ned met up with the two of you, a\nshit-eating grin on his face. It was apparent that Peter apologizing\nto you in Chemistry had been a plan between the two of them, and Ned\nwas happy to see that it came to fruition.</p><p>\nBut\nthe smiles and occasional laughter were short-lived. \n</p><p>\nYou\nfroze. Ned and Peter\u2019s eyes followed yours, landing on the thin\nfigure of your mother, leaning against a black car. Her eyes were red\nand swollen, all color drained from her face. Your heart dropped into\nyour stomach like a bomb.</p><p>\nSomething\nwas wrong.</p><p>\nYou\nlooked back at Ned and Peter apologetically with panic in your eyes.\nYou ran to your mother, immediately demanding to know what was going\non.</p><p>\n\u201cBaby,\u201d\nshe whispered, clutching your shoulders in what you assumed was meant\nto be a comforting fashion, but it was more like she was holding on\nfor dear life, \u201cat your dad\u2019s work\u2026 there was an accident.\u201d</p><p>\nIn\na single moment, your world crumbled.</p><p><b><a href=\"http://loveissupernatural.tumblr.com/post/177006987816/the-man-behind-the-mask-pt-4-peter-parker-x\">Pt 4</a></b></p>",

Your curtains were closed and your room was pitch\nblack \u2013 what time was it? You\u2019d been having a pleasant dream about\nbeing invited to a concert by your favorite musical artist and\nstriking up a friendship with them; so a flood of disappointment\nwashed over you the moment you realized that it was only that, a\ndream. The momentary disappointment was quickly replaced by fear; who\nwould be knocking on your window at this time of night? Was it a\nrobber testing to see if anyone was in the apartment? Was it an\nassociate of your would-be murderer, coming to finish you off? A\nthousand thoughts flooded through your mind as you slowly stepped out\nof bed, careful not to make any distinguishable noise. You tip-toed\nto the kitchen and carefully slid the largest and sharpest butcher\nknife from the wooden cutting block. \n</p><p>\nYour\nreflection looked back at you in the shining steel of the knife,\nsleep-deprived and obviously afraid. You searched your own alarmed\neyes and took a deep breath \u2013 you were <i>not</i> going to be the\nweak damsel again. Resolve formed behind the hesitance. With a nod to\nyourself, you tip-toed back to your room with the knife held above\nyour head, ready for instant action. Whoever or <i>what</i>ever the\nhell this was, they\u2019d picked the wrong fucking apartment to rob\ntonight.</p><p>\nAs\nyou approached, armed with determination and a huge-ass knife, the\nsoft tap sounded at the window again. You just barely kept yourself\nfrom jumping a mile into the air and giving away your position. With\ncaution, you reached your shaking hand toward the dark blue curtains,\nbarely able to distinguish your hand from the darkness. You held your\nbreath, and in what seemed like slow motion, your fingers closed\naround the rough fabric.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\nAll\nat once, you swung open the curtains, knife wielded in your firm\ngrasp, ready to defend yourself the moment it was necessary. You were\nmet with large white eyes that made you yelp, dropping the knife onto\nthe soft carpet of your bedroom as you stumbled back, hand clutched\nover your frantic heart. The muscle was trying to bust out of the\nprison of your rib cage and escape, as if was frightened itself. \n</p><p>\n\u201cWhoa,\nwhoa, whoa, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d came a frantic familiar voice, red hands\npressed against the glass in a concerned way. You threw your head\nback and sighed in relief, hand still grasping at your chest. It was\njust Spider-Man.</p><p>\nWait.\nIt was Spider-Man.</p><p>\n\u201cWhat\n\u2013 what are you doing here?\u201d you demanded in disbelief. \u201cWhat\ntime is it?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWell,\nI was just out, ya know, patrolling the city, and I \u2013 hey, could\nyou maybe open the window?\u201d he asked a little squeamishly, pointing\nto the closed latches on your windowsill. His large white eyes\nwidened innocently.</p><p>\nYou\nsighed exasperatedly at the scare he gave you, coming forward to do\nas he asked. You slowly lifted the bottom half of your window to\nallow in the chilly night breeze, Spider-Man standing back on your\nfire escape with his hands grasped together in an almost-ashamed way.\nIt was an odd oxymoron to see a hero so graceful standing there\nlooking so very awkward.</p><p>\n\u201cUm,\u201d\nyou began, arms crossed over your chest; you were suddenly painfully\naware of the bra you were lacking, \u201cwhat\u2014what\u2019s up, Spider-Man?\u201d\nThe words felt so surreal falling from your lips. The \u00a0retreating\nmelatonin, rushing adrenaline, and surprise mixing in your veins was\nquite the heady combination.</p><p>\nTo\nyour adding surprise, he looked even more awkward, staring at his\nfeet.</p><p>\n\u201cLike\nI said, I was just swinging around Queens, keeping an eye on stuff,\nya know?\u201d he shrugged, scratching at the back of his neck where you\nassumed his mask met his suit. \u201cAnd I was already in the\nneighborhood and thought, hey, I wonder how Y/N\u2019s doing?\u201d</p><p>\nYour\neyebrows rose. \u201cUm, wow\u2026 thanks for coming by, but I\u2019m doing\nfine. Keeping myself distracted with school and stuff.\u201d He nodded\nand clasped his hands behind his back, looking at his feet once\nagain. Your brows furrowed. \u201cWas there something else\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cDid\nyou, uh, get my apple?\u201d he asked, looking up at you. The large\nwhite eyes somehow seemed hopeful. His kind voice certainly was. You\ncouldn\u2019t stop the embarrassingly large grin that stretched across\nyour face.</p><p>\n\u201cUm,\nyeah. Yeah, I did,\u201d you replied, hoping he could tell how thankful\nyou were for his thoughtfulness. \u201cThat was\u2026 so sweet. You didn\u2019t\nhave to do that.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI\ntold you I\u2019d walk you home \u2013 more or less,\u201d he shrugged, bashful.\nYou smiled even bigger. \u201cSo, uh\u2026 how was your first full day in\nNew York?\u201d</p><p>\nYour\nsmile reached your eyes as you looked at him, almost shaking your\nhead in disbelief. Spider-Man was here, on your fire escape, in the\nearly hours of the morning, checking on you and asking you about your\nfirst day. You had another \u2018Is this your life?\u2019 moment.</p><p>\n\u201cIt\nwas okay, I guess,\u201d you laughed, your tone making your amusement at\nhis interest in you apparent. \u201cI went to my new school yesterday.\nKinda scary, a lot bigger than what I\u2019m used to.\u201d You stifled a\nyawn.</p><p>\n\u201cOh,\nokay, cool,\u201d he nodded, shifting his weight back and forth onto his\nright foot, then his left. He looked like he desperately wanted\nsomething, but what, you couldn\u2019t tell.</p><p>\n\u201cLook,\nI cannot put into words how much I appreciate you coming by, even\nthough you almost made me pee my pants,\u201d you chuckled, trying to\nkeep your tone light, \u201cbut what are you doing here, really?\u201d</p><p>\nHe\nsighed, and you imagined him biting his lip.</p><p>\n\u201cYou\nhave to promise not to ask any questions, okay? Because I can\u2019t tell\nyou anything.\u201d</p><p>\nYour\ninterest instantly piqued, you carefully climbed out of the window to\nmeet him on the fire escape. You kept your arms crossed to guard your\nbra-less chest against the cold New York wind. You sat on your\nwindowsill, trying to appear relaxed and friendly as you gave him an\nencouraging smile.</p><p>\n\u201cI\ndon\u2019t really know what all of this is about, but I promise,\u201d you\nsaid. Spider-Man crossed his arms as well and leaned against your\nrailing, crossing one ankle over the other. He stood out in an almost\nethereal way against the black night sky and the glowing lights of\nQueens below.</p><p>\n\u201cLet\u2019s\njust say that\u2026 I know a guy at Midtown High,\u201d he began\nhesitantly, and your brows automatically pulled together, \u201cand he\nfeels really awful about how he treated you at school yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\nYour\nmind instantly flashed to Peter Parker, or was it Ned? Was it maybe\none of the assholes who catcalled you throughout the day?</p><p>\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nyou asked, almost as if you didn\u2019t hear him correctly. What was he\ntelling you? That he is friends with Ned and Peter, or one of the\njerks that liked to ogle you from across the room? Did <i>he</i> go\nto Midtown High? Could Spider-Man really be that young? He <i>sounded</i>\nyoung.</p><p>\n\u201cYou\nsaid you wouldn\u2019t ask any questions,\u201d he reminded you, almost in a\npanicked way. His hands were held out in front of him as if they\nwould physically block the questions in your gaze and coming out of\nyour mouth.</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2014I\nknow,\u201d you said, trying to think of a way to phrase what you wanted\nto know without it technically asking something. \u201cNot asking a\nquestion\u2014but you\u2019re gonna have to clarify who feels awful. I had a\nfew incidents yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\nDid\nSpider-Man look <i>guilty</i>? Surely not, but you didn\u2019t know how\nelse to describe his hung head and lack of eye contact. He seemed\nincredibly uncomfortable. Well, it <i>did</i> suck having to play the\nmessenger between two parties, you reminded yourself.</p><p>\n\u201cNot\na good first day?\u201d he asked, and he sounded like he wanted to punch\nhimself in the face.</p><p>\n\u201cSome\nguys are assholes,\u201d you said simply, tone still light. \u201cLook, you\ndon\u2019t have to play intermediary for whoever it is. They can apologize\nthemselves, you know.\u201d</p><p>\nHe\nsighed heavily, his shoulders slumping with it. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\nI\u2019ll, uh, I\u2019ll let him know. But he does feel like a total jerk.\u201d</p><p>\nYou\nsquinted at him and tilted your head to the side, trying to somehow\nlook past his lensed white eyes and into his mind. He looked back,\nhis mask unusually inexpressive: a perfect poker face. The air was\ntense.</p><p>\n\u201cHe\ndoes?\u201d you asked, but it sounded more like a statement than a\nquestion. \n</p><p>\nSpider-Man\nnodded earnestly. \n</p><p>\nUncrossing\nyour arms, you stood up from your position on the windowsill and\nstepped closer to the guy who saved your life, twice. You smiled at\nhim. He stopped leaning against your rail and stood up as well, a\nfull head taller than you. You craned your neck a bit to look into\nthe eyes of his mask.</p><p>\n\u201cEnough\nabout me,\u201d you smiled softly, \u201cwhat about you? How was <i>your</i>\nday, Spidey?\u201d</p><p>\nHe\nchuckled a bit uneasily, and his hand started rubbing the back of his\nneck again. You could see him smiling underneath the mask, and if you\ndidn\u2019t know better, you\u2019d say he seemed a bit flustered.</p><p>\n\u201cOh,\nyou know, the usual,\u201d he said, and you were overwhelmed by fondness\nfor his apparent bashfulness. \u201cStopped a homeless guy from breaking\ninto an ATM a few blocks away, walked an old lady home who forgot\nwhere she lived \u2013 again. Stopped by to check on this girl\u2026\u201d</p><p>\nYou\nlaughed. \u201cLucky her. Do you stop by and wake up all the girls you\nsave in the wee hours of the morning?\u201d</p><p>\nSpider-Man\nseemed very interested in his feet again, and you found yourself\nhaving trouble believing what Ned said about the rumored Avenger\u2019s\nhabit of giving women gifts. The lean, muscular hero looked a bit\nlike an overwhelmed puppy in a costume right now. He didn\u2019t answer\nyour question, he just shrugged. You could still see the smile\nunderneath the mask.</p><p>\n\u201cWell,\nuh, I\u2019d better get going,\u201d he said suddenly, seeming to come back\nto himself a bit. He motioned over his shoulder toward the faint\nsound of sirens in the distance. \u201cSorry about waking you up.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNo,\nno, it\u2019s okay,\u201d you said quickly, stopping yourself from reaching\nfor him. His announcement of his soon-to-be exit made you realize\njust how badly you didn\u2019t want him to go just yet. \u201cCome wake me up\nanytime. Who needs sleep anyway?\u201d</p><p>\nHe\nseemed to laugh to himself, launching into a crouch on your\nguardrail. You were amazed that he could effortlessly balance on such\na thin piece of metal. He turned his head back toward you.</p><p>\n\u201cGoodnight,\nY/N,\u201d he said quietly. Then, as quickly as he appeared, he was gone\nin a blur of webs, red, and blue.</p><p>\n\u201cGoodnight,\nSpider-Man,\u201d you smiled to yourself.</p><p>\nYou\nhadn\u2019t fallen back asleep until two hours before you woke up for\nschool, your mind racing with what Spider-Man\u2019s visit meant. Had he\nreally come to check on you because he cared about you, or did he\nfeel obligated to play messenger for his elusive friend at Midtown?\nWas it some strange combination of both? Your heart swelled as you\nthought about his sweet demeanor and floor-drawn eyes. Did you make\nSpider-Man blush? Not that you\u2019d know with that mask.</p><p>\nYour\nheart fluttered as you awoke, the events of the previous night\nreplaying in your head like a constantly-rewinding tape. You wondered\nif he would visit you again. You certainly hoped so.</p><hr><p>\nYour\nbrave decision to confront Peter Parker about his bizarre behavior\ntoward you dwindled away, along with your courage, as the day passed.\nYou\u2019d seen Ned a handful of times from across the hall that day, and\nhe had smiled at you as if absolutely nothing was out of the\nordinary; this confused you more. He even stopped to talk to you\nonce, explaining how he and Peter would be missing lunch to put the\nfinishing touches on their project for robotics class. You nodded,\nunsure of how to interpret his sudden warmth. Was Ned the friend that\nSpider-Man had been apologizing for?</p><p>\nThe\nstudent body found you no less interesting than they had the day\nbefore, a particular group of jocks whistling at you in the hallways,\njust like yesterday. You blushed and kept walking, gripping on to\nyour backpack straps a bit more tightly.</p><p>\nChemistry\nwas your final class of the day, and you were thankful that your\napartment was only an hour and thirty minutes away from your grasp.\nYou\u2019d forgotten to bring your lunch to school that day, the result\nbeing a suspicious-looking 'pizza\u2019 and sitting in a girls\u2019 bathroom\nstall to eat it. With Ned not at lunch, you were terrified of the\nstares you\u2019d receive by sitting alone. Eating lunch alone, in\nprivate, was 1,000 times better than eating your lunch alone in\npublic. The day had almost been worse than yesterday, and you sighed\nin relief as you stepped into the Chemistry classroom. You could\ntaste the anticipation of the final period of the day in the air. It\ntasted like freedom.</p><p>\nThe\nbell rang to start class, and just before the teacher closed the\nclassroom door, rushing in came none other than a disheveled Peter\nParker. The teacher eyed him a bit scornfully but said nothing, his\nmouth pursed in a straight line as he closed the door behind Peter.\n\u201cNot technically late,\u201d you thought you heard Peter mumble to him\nhopefully.</p><p>\nPeter\npower-walked to a seat in the back of the classroom at a lab table\ncovered in papers, keeping his head down.</p><p>\n\u201cNow,\u201d\nyour professor began, picking up a piece of chalk and turning to\nwrite on the board, \u201cwe are going to continue our discussion of\natoms and what environmental factors influence their behavior. I have\ndecided to delegate a bit of partner work \u2014 I know that it\u2019s Friday\nand we are all eager to get home. There are 24 of you in here, so\npair up.\u201d He wrote out a few multipart questions for you all to\ncopy. \u201cI don\u2019t care with who, but pick a partner and get to work.\nThe faster you get done, the faster we can all get outta here. How\u2019s\nthat?\u201d</p><p>\nYour\nclassmates smiled and hummed in agreement. You had to concur. The\nfaster today was over with, the better. But then anxiety slammed into\nyou like a speeding truck on a highway. You didn\u2019t know anyone in\nthis classroom. Well, the only person you <i>had</i> met was Peter,\nand you were sure that he would rather work with anyone<i> but</i>\nyou. With hopeless eyes, you turned toward the rest of the classroom\nas chairs started to scrape and backpacks began being stuffed,\nstudents finding their friends and moving about the classroom to join\nthem. This was going to be embarrassing.</p><p>\nAs\nyou prepared yourself to stand up and start aimlessly wandering\naround the room so that you didn\u2019t look so pitiful and alone, you\nheard the loud scrape of a stool behind you. You turned to find Peter\nParker sliding into the seat next to you at your lab table with a\ncautious smile, as if afraid you were going to bite him for coming\ntoo close. You were positive that the shock was showing on your face.</p><p>\n\u201cUm,\nhi, I\u2019m Peter,\u201d he said softly, as if you\u2019d run any minute. He\nhesitantly extended his hand to shake yours, a hopeful yet guilty\nlook in his brown eyes. \u201cPeter Parker. My buddy Ned introduced us\nat lunch yesterday?\u201d</p><p>\nYou\nstared at his hand for a moment, almost rudely, but then caught\nyourself. You shook it back. His grip was surprisingly strong and\nfirm. His hand was warm.</p><p>\n\u201cYeah,\nI remember you,\u201d you said, eyes a bit narrowed. You were tempted to\nchew him out for his rude departure, but you bit your tongue. \u201cYou,\nuh, had to run off?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYeah,\u201d\nhe breathed, almost in an exhausted way, \u201cI\u2026 had something come\nup.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNed\nsaid you had an internship with Tony Stark?\u201d you questioned, hoping\nto gauge his reaction to this information as truthful or not. His\neyes widened.</p><p>\n\u201cYeah,\nI have since last year,\u201d he said, and you almost felt the wave of\nrelief flood through him. \u201cIt\u2019s super crazy. Mr. Stark has me\ndoing\u2026 <i>all kinds</i> of stuff for him.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWorking\nfor Iron Man has to be pretty awesome,\u201d you said lightly, taking\nthe handouts that were being passed around the room. \u201cI bet you get\naccess to all kinds of cool tech, huh?\u201d</p><p>\nPeter\nsmiled, and you tried to hold back your own. He was quite attractive\nto you, and keeping your blush at bay was priority Defcon One. How\ndid you go from being angry with him two minutes ago to beating down\nthe butterflies in your stomach the next?</p><p>\n\u201cYeah,\nit <i>is</i> pretty cool,\u201d he conceded, shrugging his shoulders\nmodestly. He turned his stool toward you, his entire body facing you\nnow. \u201cYou\u2019re Y/N, right?\u201d \n</p><p>\nYou\nturned your entire body toward him as well, not able to stop your\ngenuine grin. Something about him felt familiar, but you couldn\u2019t\nquite put your finger on it. You tried to deny how much you liked the\nsound of your name coming from his mouth, but when he met your\naffirming nod with a sweet smile, you knew denial was pointless. You\nhad a crush.</p><p>\n\u201cHey,\nso, this might sound kinda weird,\u201d he started, scratching the back\nof his neck nervously. The movement caught your eye, \u201cbut running\naway like that at lunch yesterday wasn\u2019t cool of me to do. I didn\u2019t\nmean to\u2026 make you think that I didn\u2019t want to meet you or\nanything\u2026\u201d</p><p>\nYour\neyes narrowed further, and you tilted your head to the side,\nobserving him. Peter looked downright nervous. He ran a hand through\nhis thick chocolate waves.</p><p>\n\u201cDo\nyou\u2026 do you happen to have a friend that makes a habit of swinging\nby people\u2019s apartments at 2:30 in the morning?\u201d you ask curiously,\na lazy smile tugging at the corner of your pink lips. Peter gulped\nand his eyes widened just the smallest bit.</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2014I\ndon\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d he said. His hands were\nwringing underneath the table and you definitely noticed.</p><p>\n\u201cSo\nyou\u2019re <i>not</i> friends with Spider-Man?\u201d you clarified, smirking\na little. His face was the only answer that you really needed. Poor\nPeter was an open book.</p><p>\n\u201cI\nmean,\u201d he started, observing your knowing look and stuttering, \u201cI\nmight\u2019ve met the guy a <i>few</i> times. He\u2026 he s-saved my friends.\nIn an elevator. Last year. In Washington D.C.\u201d</p><p>\nYou\ngrinned, concluding without a doubt that Peter was on the other side\nof Spider-Man\u2019s awkward apologies. Peter smiled back at you, his\nchocolate eyes crinkling at the corners. Any anger or resentment you\nmay have harbored toward Peter was obliterated in that moment.</p><p>\n\u201cGet\nworking!\u201d called your teacher suddenly, making the whole class look\nup from their conversations to pick up their beakers and appropriate\nforms.</p><p>\nPeter\nfollowed the teacher\u2019s instructions, but had a subtle smile pulling\nat the corner of his lips as he organized your supplies.</p><p>\n\u201cSo,\nI\u2019m guessing that Spider-Man told you about our little run-in two\nnights ago?\u201d you asked, handing \u00a0Peter a copy of your handout. His\neyebrows rose in question. \u201cI mean, you sent the poor guy to my\napartment at 2:00 AM this morning.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOh,\nyeah, he mentioned you,\u201d Peter agreed suddenly, turning on the\nBunsen Burner with caution. \u201cYa know, uh\u2026 he just told me about\nthe guy who was trying to hurt you. Your\u2014your name came up and he\nsaid it was your first night in New York\u2026 so I thought we had to be\ntalking about the same person.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhy\ndidn\u2019t you just wait to talk to me today?\u201d you asked, picking up a\nsmall bottle filled with white powder and turning it around in your\nhands. Your confused look caused Peter to hold out his hand, a small\nsmile still playing at his lips. You placed the bottle in his palm,\ntrying to ignore the spark of butterflies in your stomach when your\nfingers brushed his.</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2014I\ndon\u2019t know,\u201d Peter said, his voice small and a bit embarrassed.\n\u201cMaybe I thought you\u2019d take it better from him, from Spider-Man.\nHe\u2019s kinda a cool guy, you know? Not <i>kinda</i> cool, but you know,\n<i>really </i>cool.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cHe\nis pretty awesome,\u201d you grinned at Peter\u2019s fanboying. \u201cYou know,\nhe has these super cool tiny lenses that make up the eyes on his\nmask?\u201d</p><p>\nPeter\nturned to you, his look some combination of astonishment and another\nemotion you couldn\u2019t quite place.</p><p>\n\u201cI,\nuh, I never noticed,\u201d he said, clearing his throat.</p><p>\n\u201cYeah,\nI noticed them the other night,\u201d you continued, fangirling a bit.\n\u201cHis suit was really neat, his eyes kind of do this auto-focus\nthing. I wonder where he got it\u2014maybe he made it? I don\u2019t know, it\nseems kinda high-tech.\u201d</p><p>\nPeter\nhanded you a pair of protective eyeglasses, clearing his throat\nagain. He placed his own over his eyes, suddenly very interested in\nadjusting the flame of the Bunsen Burner just so.</p><p>\n\u201cWho\nknows?\u201d Peter shrugged dismissively. \u201cHey, do you mind handing me\nthe sodium polyacrylate?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThe\nwhat?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThe\nlittle bottle next to your notebook,\u201d he said, trying to hide his\nsmile.</p><p>\n\u201cYeah,\nyeah, sure,\u201d you nod quickly, handing him the aforementioned\nchemical. Peter obviously knew what he was doing, and you very\nobviously did not. \u201cSorry, I won\u2019t be too great of a partner\u2026 I\ndon\u2019t really get any of this.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNo,\nit\u2019s okay,\u201d Peter said quickly, stopping just before he poured a\nbit of the sodium whatever-it\u2019s-called into the boiling beaker to\nlook at you. \u201cYou came in right as we were finishing up the unit. I\ndon\u2019t think anybody would know what was going on.\u201d</p><p>\nYou\nlooked around the classroom, and only one other table looked remotely\ncompetent. Everyone else seemed to have just as much of an idea of\nwhat they were supposed to do as you did. You thanked your lucky\nstars that Peter was your partner, and not only because you found him\ncute. Ned did say that Peter was 'wicked smart\u2019, and you were sure\nhis skills in chemistry were just the tip of the iceberg. After all,\nhe had an internship with <i>Tony Stark\u2014</i>someone has to be\ngenius-level smart for that, right?</p><p>\n\u201cI\ndon\u2019t think anyone really knows what they\u2019re doing,\u201d you commented\nwith an air of relief. \u201cThanks for coming to sit with me, or I\u2019d\nstill be trying to light the Bunsen Burner right about now.\u201d</p><p>\nPeter\u2019s\neyes darted from the beaker to you, but only for a moment, before\nreturning to his task. One corner of his mouth pulled up, ever so\nslightly. For whatever reason, the expression made the butterflies in\nyour stomach dance.</p><p>\n\u201cYeah,\nyeah, no problem,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, after running off yesterday\nit\u2019s the least I could do.\u201d</p><p>\nYou\nboth worked in comfortable silence after that, occasionally making\ncomments and asking questions back and forth, mostly related to the\nassignment. You both reached for a pencil at the same time and\nbrushed fingers again, sending your heart into a frenzy. His cheeks\nwere tinted pink for a moment after that, and you hoped it was for\nthe same reason yours were, and not from the heat of the Bunsen\nBurner.</p><p>\nBefore\nyou knew it, you were quite literally saved by the bell, and students\ngrabbed their backpacks and booked it out of the classroom for the\nweekend. You were still gathering your books, and to your pleasant\nsurprise, Peter waited on you, his backpack thrown over one shoulder\nand a hand in the pocket of his jeans.</p><p>\n\u201cOh,\nyou don\u2019t have to wait on me,\u201d you said quickly, letting your hair\nfall over your face as you organized some loose pages in your binder.\nYour cheeks felt a little hot again and you didn\u2019t want Peter to\nnotice.</p><p>\n\u201cI\nknow,\u201d Peter said simply, a kind smile on his handsome face. \u201cI\nthought maybe you\u2019d want someone to walk to the bus stop with? Or\u2014or\nnot, that\u2019s cool, too.\u201d He was scratching the back of his neck\nagain. It must be a nervous habit.</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019d\nlove that, actually,\u201d you reassured him, flashing him a brilliant\nsmile. He smiled back at you and his cheeks were tinted pink again.\nAnd there went your damn butterflies.</p><p>\nAs\nyou walked to the bus stop, Ned met up with the two of you, a\nshit-eating grin on his face. It was apparent that Peter apologizing\nto you in Chemistry had been a plan between the two of them, and Ned\nwas happy to see that it came to fruition.</p><p>\nBut\nthe smiles and occasional laughter were short-lived. \n</p><p>\nYou\nfroze.

Your curtains were closed and your room was pitch\nblack &ndash; what time was it? You&rsquo;d been having a pleasant dream about\nbeing invited to a concert by your favorite musical artist and\nstriking up a friendship with them; so a flood of disappointment\nwashed over you the moment you realized that it was only that, a\ndream. The momentary disappointment was quickly replaced by fear; who\nwould be knocking on your window at this time of night? Was it a\nrobber testing to see if anyone was in the apartment? Was it an\nassociate of your would-be murderer, coming to finish you off? A\nthousand thoughts flooded through your mind as you slowly stepped out\nof bed, careful not to make any distinguishable noise. You tip-toed\nto the kitchen and carefully slid the largest and sharpest butcher\nknife from the wooden cutting block. \n</p><p>\nYour\nreflection looked back at you in the shining steel of the knife,\nsleep-deprived and obviously afraid. You searched your own alarmed\neyes and took a deep breath &ndash; you were <i>not</i> going to be the\nweak damsel again. Resolve formed behind the hesitance. With a nod to\nyourself, you tip-toed back to your room with the knife held above\nyour head, ready for instant action. Whoever or <i>what</i>ever the\nhell this was, they&rsquo;d picked the wrong fucking apartment to rob\ntonight.</p><p>\nAs\nyou approached, armed with determination and a huge-ass knife, the\nsoft tap sounded at the window again. You just barely kept yourself\nfrom jumping a mile into the air and giving away your position. With\ncaution, you reached your shaking hand toward the dark blue curtains,\nbarely able to distinguish your hand from the darkness. You held your\nbreath, and in what seemed like slow motion, your fingers closed\naround the rough fabric.</p><p>\nAll\nat once, you swung open the curtains, knife wielded in your firm\ngrasp, ready to defend yourself the moment it was necessary. You were\nmet with large white eyes that made you yelp, dropping the knife onto\nthe soft carpet of your bedroom as you stumbled back, hand clutched\nover your frantic heart. The muscle was trying to bust out of the\nprison of your rib cage and escape, as if was frightened itself. \n</p><p>\n&ldquo;Whoa,\nwhoa, whoa, I&rsquo;m sorry!&rdquo; came a frantic familiar voice, red hands\npressed against the glass in a concerned way. You threw your head\nback and sighed in relief, hand still grasping at your chest. It was\njust Spider-Man.</p><p>\nWait.\nIt was Spider-Man.</p><p>\n&ldquo;What\n&ndash; what are you doing here?&rdquo; you demanded in disbelief. &ldquo;What\ntime is it?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Well,\nI was just out, ya know, patrolling the city, and I &ndash; hey, could\nyou maybe open the window?&rdquo; he asked a little squeamishly, pointing\nto the closed latches on your windowsill. His large white eyes\nwidened innocently.</p><p>\nYou\nsighed exasperatedly at the scare he gave you, coming forward to do\nas he asked. You slowly lifted the bottom half of your window to\nallow in the chilly night breeze, Spider-Man standing back on your\nfire escape with his hands grasped together in an almost-ashamed way.\nIt was an odd oxymoron to see a hero so graceful standing there\nlooking so very awkward.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Um,&rdquo;\nyou began, arms crossed over your chest; you were suddenly painfully\naware of the bra you were lacking, &ldquo;what&mdash;what&rsquo;s up, Spider-Man?&rdquo;\nThe words felt so surreal falling from your lips. The &nbsp;retreating\nmelatonin, rushing adrenaline, and surprise mixing in your veins was\nquite the heady combination.</p><p>\nTo\nyour adding surprise, he looked even more awkward, staring at his\nfeet.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Like\nI said, I was just swinging around Queens, keeping an eye on stuff,\nya know?&rdquo; he shrugged, scratching at the back of his neck where you\nassumed his mask met his suit. &ldquo;And I was already in the\nneighborhood and thought, hey, I wonder how Y/N&rsquo;s doing?&rdquo;</p><p>\nYour\neyebrows rose. &ldquo;Um, wow&hellip; thanks for coming by, but I&rsquo;m doing\nfine. Keeping myself distracted with school and stuff.&rdquo; He nodded\nand clasped his hands behind his back, looking at his feet once\nagain. Your brows furrowed. &ldquo;Was there something else&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Did\nyou, uh, get my apple?&rdquo; he asked, looking up at you. The large\nwhite eyes somehow seemed hopeful. His kind voice certainly was. You\ncouldn&rsquo;t stop the embarrassingly large grin that stretched across\nyour face.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Um,\nyeah. Yeah, I did,&rdquo; you replied, hoping he could tell how thankful\nyou were for his thoughtfulness. &ldquo;That was&hellip; so sweet. You didn&rsquo;t\nhave to do that.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I\ntold you I&rsquo;d walk you home &ndash; more or less,&rdquo; he shrugged, bashful.\nYou smiled even bigger. &ldquo;So, uh&hellip; how was your first full day in\nNew York?&rdquo;</p><p>\nYour\nsmile reached your eyes as you looked at him, almost shaking your\nhead in disbelief. Spider-Man was here, on your fire escape, in the\nearly hours of the morning, checking on you and asking you about your\nfirst day. You had another &lsquo;Is this your life?&rsquo; moment.</p><p>\n&ldquo;It\nwas okay, I guess,&rdquo; you laughed, your tone making your amusement at\nhis interest in you apparent. &ldquo;I went to my new school yesterday.\nKinda scary, a lot bigger than what I&rsquo;m used to.&rdquo; You stifled a\nyawn.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Oh,\nokay, cool,&rdquo; he nodded, shifting his weight back and forth onto his\nright foot, then his left. He looked like he desperately wanted\nsomething, but what, you couldn&rsquo;t tell.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Look,\nI cannot put into words how much I appreciate you coming by, even\nthough you almost made me pee my pants,&rdquo; you chuckled, trying to\nkeep your tone light, &ldquo;but what are you doing here, really?&rdquo;</p><p>\nHe\nsighed, and you imagined him biting his lip.</p><p>\n&ldquo;You\nhave to promise not to ask any questions, okay? Because I can&rsquo;t tell\nyou anything.&rdquo;</p><p>\nYour\ninterest instantly piqued, you carefully climbed out of the window to\nmeet him on the fire escape. You kept your arms crossed to guard your\nbra-less chest against the cold New York wind. You sat on your\nwindowsill, trying to appear relaxed and friendly as you gave him an\nencouraging smile.</p><p>\n&ldquo;I\ndon&rsquo;t really know what all of this is about, but I promise,&rdquo; you\nsaid. Spider-Man crossed his arms as well and leaned against your\nrailing, crossing one ankle over the other. He stood out in an almost\nethereal way against the black night sky and the glowing lights of\nQueens below.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s\njust say that&hellip; I know a guy at Midtown High,&rdquo; he began\nhesitantly, and your brows automatically pulled together, &ldquo;and he\nfeels really awful about how he treated you at school yesterday.&rdquo;</p><p>\nYour\nmind instantly flashed to Peter Parker, or was it Ned? Was it maybe\none of the assholes who catcalled you throughout the day?</p><p>\n&ldquo;What?&rdquo;\nyou asked, almost as if you didn&rsquo;t hear him correctly. What was he\ntelling you? That he is friends with Ned and Peter, or one of the\njerks that liked to ogle you from across the room? Did <i>he</i> go\nto Midtown High? Could Spider-Man really be that young? He <i>sounded</i>\nyoung.</p><p>\n&ldquo;You\nsaid you wouldn&rsquo;t ask any questions,&rdquo; he reminded you, almost in a\npanicked way. His hands were held out in front of him as if they\nwould physically block the questions in your gaze and coming out of\nyour mouth.</p><p>\n&ldquo;I&mdash;I\nknow,&rdquo; you said, trying to think of a way to phrase what you wanted\nto know without it technically asking something. &ldquo;Not asking a\nquestion&mdash;but you&rsquo;re gonna have to clarify who feels awful. I had a\nfew incidents yesterday.&rdquo;</p><p>\nDid\nSpider-Man look <i>guilty</i>? Surely not, but you didn&rsquo;t know how\nelse to describe his hung head and lack of eye contact. He seemed\nincredibly uncomfortable. Well, it <i>did</i> suck having to play the\nmessenger between two parties, you reminded yourself.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Not\na good first day?&rdquo; he asked, and he sounded like he wanted to punch\nhimself in the face.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Some\nguys are assholes,&rdquo; you said simply, tone still light. &ldquo;Look, you\ndon&rsquo;t have to play intermediary for whoever it is. They can apologize\nthemselves, you know.&rdquo;</p><p>\nHe\nsighed heavily, his shoulders slumping with it. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right.\nI&rsquo;ll, uh, I&rsquo;ll let him know. But he does feel like a total jerk.&rdquo;</p><p>\nYou\nsquinted at him and tilted your head to the side, trying to somehow\nlook past his lensed white eyes and into his mind. He looked back,\nhis mask unusually inexpressive: a perfect poker face. The air was\ntense.</p><p>\n&ldquo;He\ndoes?&rdquo; you asked, but it sounded more like a statement than a\nquestion. \n</p><p>\nSpider-Man\nnodded earnestly. \n</p><p>\nUncrossing\nyour arms, you stood up from your position on the windowsill and\nstepped closer to the guy who saved your life, twice. You smiled at\nhim. He stopped leaning against your rail and stood up as well, a\nfull head taller than you. You craned your neck a bit to look into\nthe eyes of his mask.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Enough\nabout me,&rdquo; you smiled softly, &ldquo;what about you? How was <i>your</i>\nday, Spidey?&rdquo;</p><p>\nHe\nchuckled a bit uneasily, and his hand started rubbing the back of his\nneck again. You could see him smiling underneath the mask, and if you\ndidn&rsquo;t know better, you&rsquo;d say he seemed a bit flustered.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Oh,\nyou know, the usual,&rdquo; he said, and you were overwhelmed by fondness\nfor his apparent bashfulness. &ldquo;Stopped a homeless guy from breaking\ninto an ATM a few blocks away, walked an old lady home who forgot\nwhere she lived &ndash; again. Stopped by to check on this girl&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>\nYou\nlaughed. &ldquo;Lucky her. Do you stop by and wake up all the girls you\nsave in the wee hours of the morning?&rdquo;</p><p>\nSpider-Man\nseemed very interested in his feet again, and you found yourself\nhaving trouble believing what Ned said about the rumored Avenger&rsquo;s\nhabit of giving women gifts. The lean, muscular hero looked a bit\nlike an overwhelmed puppy in a costume right now. He didn&rsquo;t answer\nyour question, he just shrugged. You could still see the smile\nunderneath the mask.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Well,\nuh, I&rsquo;d better get going,&rdquo; he said suddenly, seeming to come back\nto himself a bit. He motioned over his shoulder toward the faint\nsound of sirens in the distance. &ldquo;Sorry about waking you up.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;No,\nno, it&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; you said quickly, stopping yourself from reaching\nfor him. His announcement of his soon-to-be exit made you realize\njust how badly you didn&rsquo;t want him to go just yet. &ldquo;Come wake me up\nanytime. Who needs sleep anyway?&rdquo;</p><p>\nHe\nseemed to laugh to himself, launching into a crouch on your\nguardrail. You were amazed that he could effortlessly balance on such\na thin piece of metal. He turned his head back toward you.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Goodnight,\nY/N,&rdquo; he said quietly. Then, as quickly as he appeared, he was gone\nin a blur of webs, red, and blue.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Goodnight,\nSpider-Man,&rdquo; you smiled to yourself.</p><p>\nYou\nhadn&rsquo;t fallen back asleep until two hours before you woke up for\nschool, your mind racing with what Spider-Man&rsquo;s visit meant. Had he\nreally come to check on you because he cared about you, or did he\nfeel obligated to play messenger for his elusive friend at Midtown?\nWas it some strange combination of both? Your heart swelled as you\nthought about his sweet demeanor and floor-drawn eyes. Did you make\nSpider-Man blush? Not that you&rsquo;d know with that mask.</p><p>\nYour\nheart fluttered as you awoke, the events of the previous night\nreplaying in your head like a constantly-rewinding tape. You wondered\nif he would visit you again. You certainly hoped so.</p><hr /><p>\nYour\nbrave decision to confront Peter Parker about his bizarre behavior\ntoward you dwindled away, along with your courage, as the day passed.\nYou&rsquo;d seen Ned a handful of times from across the hall that day, and\nhe had smiled at you as if absolutely nothing was out of the\nordinary; this confused you more. He even stopped to talk to you\nonce, explaining how he and Peter would be missing lunch to put the\nfinishing touches on their project for robotics class. You nodded,\nunsure of how to interpret his sudden warmth. Was Ned the friend that\nSpider-Man had been apologizing for?</p><p>\nThe\nstudent body found you no less interesting than they had the day\nbefore, a particular group of jocks whistling at you in the hallways,\njust like yesterday. You blushed and kept walking, gripping on to\nyour backpack straps a bit more tightly.</p><p>\nChemistry\nwas your final class of the day, and you were thankful that your\napartment was only an hour and thirty minutes away from your grasp.\nYou&rsquo;d forgotten to bring your lunch to school that day, the result\nbeing a suspicious-looking 'pizza&rsquo; and sitting in a girls&rsquo; bathroom\nstall to eat it. With Ned not at lunch, you were terrified of the\nstares you&rsquo;d receive by sitting alone. Eating lunch alone, in\nprivate, was 1,000 times better than eating your lunch alone in\npublic. The day had almost been worse than yesterday, and you sighed\nin relief as you stepped into the Chemistry classroom. You could\ntaste the anticipation of the final period of the day in the air. It\ntasted like freedom.</p><p>\nThe\nbell rang to start class, and just before the teacher closed the\nclassroom door, rushing in came none other than a disheveled Peter\nParker. The teacher eyed him a bit scornfully but said nothing, his\nmouth pursed in a straight line as he closed the door behind Peter.\n&ldquo;Not technically late,&rdquo; you thought you heard Peter mumble to him\nhopefully.</p><p>\nPeter\npower-walked to a seat in the back of the classroom at a lab table\ncovered in papers, keeping his head down.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Now,&rdquo;\nyour professor began, picking up a piece of chalk and turning to\nwrite on the board, &ldquo;we are going to continue our discussion of\natoms and what environmental factors influence their behavior. I have\ndecided to delegate a bit of partner work &mdash; I know that it&rsquo;s Friday\nand we are all eager to get home. There are 24 of you in here, so\npair up.&rdquo; He wrote out a few multipart questions for you all to\ncopy. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care with who, but pick a partner and get to work.\nThe faster you get done, the faster we can all get outta here. How&rsquo;s\nthat?&rdquo;</p><p>\nYour\nclassmates smiled and hummed in agreement. You had to concur. The\nfaster today was over with, the better. But then anxiety slammed into\nyou like a speeding truck on a highway. You didn&rsquo;t know anyone in\nthis classroom. Well, the only person you <i>had</i> met was Peter,\nand you were sure that he would rather work with anyone<i> but</i>\nyou. With hopeless eyes, you turned toward the rest of the classroom\nas chairs started to scrape and backpacks began being stuffed,\nstudents finding their friends and moving about the classroom to join\nthem. This was going to be embarrassing.</p><p>\nAs\nyou prepared yourself to stand up and start aimlessly wandering\naround the room so that you didn&rsquo;t look so pitiful and alone, you\nheard the loud scrape of a stool behind you. You turned to find Peter\nParker sliding into the seat next to you at your lab table with a\ncautious smile, as if afraid you were going to bite him for coming\ntoo close. You were positive that the shock was showing on your face.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Um,\nhi, I&rsquo;m Peter,&rdquo; he said softly, as if you&rsquo;d run any minute. He\nhesitantly extended his hand to shake yours, a hopeful yet guilty\nlook in his brown eyes. &ldquo;Peter Parker. My buddy Ned introduced us\nat lunch yesterday?&rdquo;</p><p>\nYou\nstared at his hand for a moment, almost rudely, but then caught\nyourself. You shook it back. His grip was surprisingly strong and\nfirm. His hand was warm.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Yeah,\nI remember you,&rdquo; you said, eyes a bit narrowed. You were tempted to\nchew him out for his rude departure, but you bit your tongue. &ldquo;You,\nuh, had to run off?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo;\nhe breathed, almost in an exhausted way, &ldquo;I&hellip; had something come\nup.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Ned\nsaid you had an internship with Tony Stark?&rdquo; you questioned, hoping\nto gauge his reaction to this information as truthful or not. His\neyes widened.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Yeah,\nI have since last year,&rdquo; he said, and you almost felt the wave of\nrelief flood through him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s super crazy. Mr. Stark has me\ndoing&hellip; <i>all kinds</i> of stuff for him.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Working\nfor Iron Man has to be pretty awesome,&rdquo; you said lightly, taking\nthe handouts that were being passed around the room. &ldquo;I bet you get\naccess to all kinds of cool tech, huh?&rdquo;</p><p>\nPeter\nsmiled, and you tried to hold back your own. He was quite attractive\nto you, and keeping your blush at bay was priority Defcon One. How\ndid you go from being angry with him two minutes ago to beating down\nthe butterflies in your stomach the next?</p><p>\n&ldquo;Yeah,\nit <i>is</i> pretty cool,&rdquo; he conceded, shrugging his shoulders\nmodestly. He turned his stool toward you, his entire body facing you\nnow. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Y/N, right?&rdquo; \n</p><p>\nYou\nturned your entire body toward him as well, not able to stop your\ngenuine grin. Something about him felt familiar, but you couldn&rsquo;t\nquite put your finger on it. You tried to deny how much you liked the\nsound of your name coming from his mouth, but when he met your\naffirming nod with a sweet smile, you knew denial was pointless. You\nhad a crush.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Hey,\nso, this might sound kinda weird,&rdquo; he started, scratching the back\nof his neck nervously. The movement caught your eye, &ldquo;but running\naway like that at lunch yesterday wasn&rsquo;t cool of me to do. I didn&rsquo;t\nmean to&hellip; make you think that I didn&rsquo;t want to meet you or\nanything&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>\nYour\neyes narrowed further, and you tilted your head to the side,\nobserving him. Peter looked downright nervous. He ran a hand through\nhis thick chocolate waves.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Do\nyou&hellip; do you happen to have a friend that makes a habit of swinging\nby people&rsquo;s apartments at 2:30 in the morning?&rdquo; you ask curiously,\na lazy smile tugging at the corner of your pink lips. Peter gulped\nand his eyes widened just the smallest bit.</p><p>\n&ldquo;I&mdash;I\ndon&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about,&rdquo; he said. His hands were\nwringing underneath the table and you definitely noticed.</p><p>\n&ldquo;So\nyou&rsquo;re <i>not</i> friends with Spider-Man?&rdquo; you clarified, smirking\na little. His face was the only answer that you really needed. Poor\nPeter was an open book.</p><p>\n&ldquo;I\nmean,&rdquo; he started, observing your knowing look and stuttering, &ldquo;I\nmight&rsquo;ve met the guy a <i>few</i> times. He&hellip; he s-saved my friends.\nIn an elevator. Last year. In Washington D.C.&rdquo;</p><p>\nYou\ngrinned, concluding without a doubt that Peter was on the other side\nof Spider-Man&rsquo;s awkward apologies. Peter smiled back at you, his\nchocolate eyes crinkling at the corners. Any anger or resentment you\nmay have harbored toward Peter was obliterated in that moment.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Get\nworking!&rdquo; called your teacher suddenly, making the whole class look\nup from their conversations to pick up their beakers and appropriate\nforms.</p><p>\nPeter\nfollowed the teacher&rsquo;s instructions, but had a subtle smile pulling\nat the corner of his lips as he organized your supplies.</p><p>\n&ldquo;So,\nI&rsquo;m guessing that Spider-Man told you about our little run-in two\nnights ago?&rdquo; you asked, handing &nbsp;Peter a copy of your handout. His\neyebrows rose in question. &ldquo;I mean, you sent the poor guy to my\napartment at 2:00 AM this morning.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Oh,\nyeah, he mentioned you,&rdquo; Peter agreed suddenly, turning on the\nBunsen Burner with caution. &ldquo;Ya know, uh&hellip; he just told me about\nthe guy who was trying to hurt you. Your&mdash;your name came up and he\nsaid it was your first night in New York&hellip; so I thought we had to be\ntalking about the same person.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Why\ndidn&rsquo;t you just wait to talk to me today?&rdquo; you asked, picking up a\nsmall bottle filled with white powder and turning it around in your\nhands. Your confused look caused Peter to hold out his hand, a small\nsmile still playing at his lips. You placed the bottle in his palm,\ntrying to ignore the spark of butterflies in your stomach when your\nfingers brushed his.</p><p>\n&ldquo;I&mdash;I\ndon&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Peter said, his voice small and a bit embarrassed.\n&ldquo;Maybe I thought you&rsquo;d take it better from him, from Spider-Man.\nHe&rsquo;s kinda a cool guy, you know? Not <i>kinda</i> cool, but you know,\n<i>really </i>cool.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;He\nis pretty awesome,&rdquo; you grinned at Peter&rsquo;s fanboying. &ldquo;You know,\nhe has these super cool tiny lenses that make up the eyes on his\nmask?&rdquo;</p><p>\nPeter\nturned to you, his look some combination of astonishment and another\nemotion you couldn&rsquo;t quite place.</p><p>\n&ldquo;I,\nuh, I never noticed,&rdquo; he said, clearing his throat.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Yeah,\nI noticed them the other night,&rdquo; you continued, fangirling a bit.\n&ldquo;His suit was really neat, his eyes kind of do this auto-focus\nthing. I wonder where he got it&mdash;maybe he made it? I don&rsquo;t know, it\nseems kinda high-tech.&rdquo;</p><p>\nPeter\nhanded you a pair of protective eyeglasses, clearing his throat\nagain. He placed his own over his eyes, suddenly very interested in\nadjusting the flame of the Bunsen Burner just so.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Who\nknows?&rdquo; Peter shrugged dismissively. &ldquo;Hey, do you mind handing me\nthe sodium polyacrylate?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;The\nwhat?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;The\nlittle bottle next to your notebook,&rdquo; he said, trying to hide his\nsmile.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Yeah,\nyeah, sure,&rdquo; you nod quickly, handing him the aforementioned\nchemical. Peter obviously knew what he was doing, and you very\nobviously did not. &ldquo;Sorry, I won&rsquo;t be too great of a partner&hellip; I\ndon&rsquo;t really get any of this.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;No,\nit&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; Peter said quickly, stopping just before he poured a\nbit of the sodium whatever-it&rsquo;s-called into the boiling beaker to\nlook at you. &ldquo;You came in right as we were finishing up the unit. I\ndon&rsquo;t think anybody would know what was going on.&rdquo;</p><p>\nYou\nlooked around the classroom, and only one other table looked remotely\ncompetent. Everyone else seemed to have just as much of an idea of\nwhat they were supposed to do as you did. You thanked your lucky\nstars that Peter was your partner, and not only because you found him\ncute. Ned did say that Peter was 'wicked smart&rsquo;, and you were sure\nhis skills in chemistry were just the tip of the iceberg. After all,\nhe had an internship with <i>Tony Stark&mdash;</i>someone has to be\ngenius-level smart for that, right?</p><p>\n&ldquo;I\ndon&rsquo;t think anyone really knows what they&rsquo;re doing,&rdquo; you commented\nwith an air of relief. &ldquo;Thanks for coming to sit with me, or I&rsquo;d\nstill be trying to light the Bunsen Burner right about now.&rdquo;</p><p>\nPeter&rsquo;s\neyes darted from the beaker to you, but only for a moment, before\nreturning to his task. One corner of his mouth pulled up, ever so\nslightly. For whatever reason, the expression made the butterflies in\nyour stomach dance.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Yeah,\nyeah, no problem,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I mean, after running off yesterday\nit&rsquo;s the least I could do.&rdquo;</p><p>\nYou\nboth worked in comfortable silence after that, occasionally making\ncomments and asking questions back and forth, mostly related to the\nassignment. You both reached for a pencil at the same time and\nbrushed fingers again, sending your heart into a frenzy. His cheeks\nwere tinted pink for a moment after that, and you hoped it was for\nthe same reason yours were, and not from the heat of the Bunsen\nBurner.</p><p>\nBefore\nyou knew it, you were quite literally saved by the bell, and students\ngrabbed their backpacks and booked it out of the classroom for the\nweekend. You were still gathering your books, and to your pleasant\nsurprise, Peter waited on you, his backpack thrown over one shoulder\nand a hand in the pocket of his jeans.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Oh,\nyou don&rsquo;t have to wait on me,&rdquo; you said quickly, letting your hair\nfall over your face as you organized some loose pages in your binder.\nYour cheeks felt a little hot again and you didn&rsquo;t want Peter to\nnotice.</p><p>\n&ldquo;I\nknow,&rdquo; Peter said simply, a kind smile on his handsome face. &ldquo;I\nthought maybe you&rsquo;d want someone to walk to the bus stop with?

Your curtains were closed and your room was pitch\nblack &ndash; what time was it? You&rsquo;d been having a pleasant dream about\nbeing invited to a concert by your favorite musical artist and\nstriking up a friendship with them; so a flood of disappointment\nwashed over you the moment you realized that it was only that, a\ndream. The momentary disappointment was quickly replaced by fear; who\nwould be knocking on your window at this time of night? Was it a\nrobber testing to see if anyone was in the apartment? Was it an\nassociate of your would-be murderer, coming to finish you off? A\nthousand thoughts flooded through your mind as you slowly stepped out\nof bed, careful not to make any distinguishable noise. You tip-toed\nto the kitchen and carefully slid the largest and sharpest butcher\nknife from the wooden cutting block. \n</p>\n<p>\nYour\nreflection looked back at you in the shining steel of the knife,\nsleep-deprived and obviously afraid. You searched your own alarmed\neyes and took a deep breath &ndash; you were <i>not</i> going to be the\nweak damsel again. Resolve formed behind the hesitance. With a nod to\nyourself, you tip-toed back to your room with the knife held above\nyour head, ready for instant action. Whoever or <i>what</i>ever the\nhell this was, they&rsquo;d picked the wrong fucking apartment to rob\ntonight.</p>\n<p>\nAs\nyou approached, armed with determination and a huge-ass knife, the\nsoft tap sounded at the window again. You just barely kept yourself\nfrom jumping a mile into the air and giving away your position. With\ncaution, you reached your shaking hand toward the dark blue curtains,\nbarely able to distinguish your hand from the darkness. You held your\nbreath, and in what seemed like slow motion, your fingers closed\naround the rough fabric.</p>\n</p>",
