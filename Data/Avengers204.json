        "body": "<p>With the second part of Infinity War looming over the horizon and spelling doom for a chunk of the original 6-piece band that launched Marvel to the top of the film industry, it\u2019s interesting going back to the movie that started it all. Not the edgier and politically aware film that was Iron Man, which began the MCU as a franchise, but the witty, corny and first proper crossover that made this cinematic universe the pop-culture dominating force it is today. </p><p>The original Avengers: Assemble has aged better in some regards than others, with one of the most glaring aspect being the Buffy-like dialogue that has been inescapable in every Marvel movie since. Silly as it is, the characters have a lot of fun together not just through dialogue but character interactions as well. The fact that the film focuses on the steps taken for these characters to come together as a team goes perfectly with the amount of banter that\u2019s exchanged, as egos and hero complexes collide. The action pieces, glaringly CG-laden as they are, remain very polished and are still a lot of fun to watch. </p><p>However, the movie\u2019s problem was never very unclear: Agent Colson and his cop-out death uniting the team feels like the most forced story telling in the entire script, especially considering how half of the characters had exchanged one line with Colson at best. The fact that he is brought back for Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D later down the line only emphasises this cheap feeling of his death being completely arbitrary, a simple vehicle to drag the characters into the 3rd act of the movie. Also, Captain America\u2019s costume is ridiculous, but watching his colour scheme gradually drop into darker tones over the course of his disillusion throughout his films is subtly tragic in its own way. </p><p>Avengers: Assemble certainly still holds up after 6 years since jumpstarting Marvel\u2019s unstoppable cinematic freight train. \u00a0It\u2019s got the heart, humour and action we\u2019ve come to expect from every single one of these movies, probably providing some of the best examples of each of each of these aspects. We can certainly expect the next big phase of the MCU to be heralded with similar flare and passion. <br/>9/10 <br/></p>",

Here!\u201d You shove the cash you\u2019d grabbed, through\nthe opening in the plexiglass, before you hop out of the still moving cab. </p><p>\u201cLady?!\u201d The cabbie yells for you. <br/></p><p>Your feet stumble, but you\nmanage to keep yourself up, and not trip on your dress. Slamming the door, you hurry\naround the back end and glance for coming traffic, before you lift the bottom\nof your gown and rush across the street opening.</p><p>You yank open the main door, hurrying in, without catching\nyour dress. Your foot comes down on the marble flooring, and your heel snaps\nwith an audible crack. <br/></p><p>\u201cShoot.\u201d You pause glancing down. <br/></p><p>You kick both heels off, before picking up\nyour dress and rushing towards the elevator. People are stopping to watch you;\nyour fingers jab the UP button over and over as you watch the floors count\ndown.</p><p>The doors open, and you step in, pulling all of your dress\ninto the box with you. You quickly punch in the code and wait for the door to\nclose. It catches the edge of your dress, the sound of tearing material fills\nthe box, followed by your laugh. You were bare foot and your dress was officially\nruined, you\u2019d lost your veil on the run for the cab. You could only image how\ncrazy you looked at this point. <br/></p><p><br/></p><hr><p><br/></p><p>He sat at the island, everyone moved around him. Filling their\nmid-morning routines, with chatter, coffee and breakfast. His thumbs tapped the\nside of his coffee cup, barely hearing anything they had to say. His mind was a\nmillion miles away this morning.</p><p>The elevator dings, forcing his eyes up. The rest of the\nteam, his family look up as well. Confused who would be joining them at this\ntime. Hurried footsteps coming towards them, what rounds the corner had him\nsitting up in his chair, and the rest of them stock still in surprise.</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d His voice sounded funny to his own ears. <br/></p><p>His eyes\ntravel over her, she\u2019s panting and out of breathe as if she\u2019d ran here. Her\nwedding dress is short sleeved, modest and the tulle, bottom seems to be\nswallowing her. It\u2019s dirty, appears ripped and she has no shoes on, her hair\nwas falling loose from an up-do she had.</p><p>\u201cOh sweet Jesus.\u201d He hears Nat mutter as she looks over her\nonce friend.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not over you.\u201d Y/N has a hand on her stomach as she\ntries to catch her breathe. \u201cI\u2019m head over,\u201d she gulps in breathe, nodding \u201crun\nout on my wedding day,\u201d she waves her hand down the front of her \u201cin love with\nyou.\u201d She nods, letting out a breathe.<br/></p><p>The room falls silent, as the two of them stare at each

But your getting dangerously close.&rdquo;</p><p>Several days later you were shuffling through the apartment making sure you had everything you&rsquo;d need. The day off your project had arrived, Peter had returned to school just in time. </p><p><i>&ldquo;You sure you and Stark had a good time, he seemed kinda occupied with Captain America to be honest. Kinda funny that you had to go to the same place.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see Mr. Stark all the time you know it was just a quick training in you know&hellip; Science management.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Even he looked confused at his excuse.</i></p><p>\u201d<i>Right</i>, <i>all I&rsquo;m saying Peter is&hellip;&ldquo;</i></p><p>&rdquo;<i>Can we please not talk about Mr. Stark.&ldquo;</i></p><p>The argument had ended there. Peter seemed extra thrilled and extra secretive about anything having to do with Tony Stark. The next few days he was obsessed with rushing home to work on his &lsquo;Stark internship&rsquo;. </p><p>&quot;Does he care at all?&rdquo; You groaned to Ned as Peter once again dissapeared right after last bell.</p><p>&ldquo;About school, the internship, or you?&rdquo; Ned countered, not even looking at you. </p><p>You thought about having a smartass comment but came up short, replacing it with a heavy sigh. </p><p>&ldquo;He agreed to help with my Lego death star tonight.&rdquo; Ned&rsquo;s voice chipper.</p><p>&ldquo;Great, he still cares about Star Wars. At least that&rsquo;s something.&rdquo; You sighed again. &ldquo;Wanna walk to the neighborhood with me? Since you promised to meet him?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Sure, don&rsquo;t you usually&hellip;.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Walk with Peter, yeah. That doesn&rsquo;t seem to be happening today.&rdquo;</p><p>***</p><p>&ldquo;Hey there, little smart ass.&rdquo; Mr. Delmar called out from behind the counter. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey there!&rdquo; You said waving-not your best comeback, but you just couldn&rsquo;t seem to find one. Was Peter bothering you that much?</p><p>&ldquo;You know, you missed Mr Parker about forty-five minutes ago.&rdquo; He turned to his colleague speaking rapidly and turning back to you. </p><p>&ldquo;He said Parker and girlfriend, must be taking about you&hellip;&rdquo; Ned pushed an elbow into your ribs, you swatted at his hand trying not to blush.</p><p>&ldquo;Soo, what did the nerd Almighty order today?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The number five with pickles.&rdquo; Mr Delmar sounded bored. </p><p>&ldquo;Took my advice I see. I&rsquo;ll have the same and what ever my buddy here wants.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Eat here, or walk?&rdquo; You turned to Ned waiting for his answer.</p><p>&ldquo;Walk, we&rsquo;ll head to Pete&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m sure May won&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo; </p><p>Walking down the streets of Queens, shoveling your sandwich in your face-you and Ned exchanged small talk between bites.</p><p>&ldquo;You know, I&rsquo;m surprised Peter hasn&rsquo;t caught on to your little crush.&rdquo; Ned always had a way of bringing it up to you.</p><p>&ldquo;Because he&rsquo;s too busy with the little crush&hellip;. Of his own.&rdquo; You rebutled. Swallowing the massive bite you just took. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m as much in the friend zone as you, Ned.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It could happen,&rdquo; he shrugged his shoulders-his back pack making a loud jingling. No doubt the Lego pieces. &ldquo;Maybe you should tell him yourself, sometimes guys like a girl who takes charge.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, and when I&rsquo;m done with that I&rsquo;ll ask Spiderman to go out with me next. Or better yet, Captain America- he&rsquo;s been single a while now.&rdquo; </p><p>The two of you had made it to the Parker residence, Peter shockingly wasn&rsquo;t home yet-it was nearly dark. But May offered his room for you to hang out in while she made dinner. Once again Ned steered the conversation towards you and Peter before you glared at him to stop. </p><p>&ldquo;The Death Star is nearly complete, my master.&rdquo; Ned dropped his voice low, trying his best.</p><p>&ldquo;Well done, Lord Vader.&rdquo; You cackled. Finishing the Lego masterpiece in silence, Ned slowly began to lift it from the bed. It was late and Peter still want home-you may as well call it a night.</p><p>But Ned&rsquo;s eyes went wide, fixated on the cieling. There crawling on all fours, Spiderman suit and all was Peter. You couldn&rsquo;t breath or even think. He slung a web closing the door silently. </p><p>Landing just as silently on the ground Peter turned meeting your eyes and Ned&rsquo;s. The crash from your Lego creation falling to the ground made you jump.</p><p>&ldquo;what was that?&rdquo; May called.</p><p>Peter franticly squeaked out this response, holding out his hand as if that would keep her from entering the room.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the Spiderman&hellip;&rdquo; Ned was stunned.</p><p>Your ears couldn&rsquo;t make out any sound as you stared at Peters suit. It was a shiny onesie. He slapped at the emblem on his chest, the suit falling I&rsquo;m a heap at his feet. He was now nearly naked and almost instantly you were in reality again.</p><p>&ldquo;oh Jesus Peter, warn a girl.&rdquo; You spun around covering your eyes-leaning against the cold bars of his bunk bed ladder.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, Sorry&rdquo; he scrambled around looking for clothes when May walked in.</p><p>&ldquo;well that didn&rsquo;t&hellip;.Peter. What &hellip;. &rdquo; She stammered, and you could only guess why. &ldquo;What are you doing? Put some clothes on, Y/N you should come with me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Love to, May. But I can&rsquo;t really open my eyes at this moment. I&rsquo;m good here as long as Peter gets dressed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aunt May I&rsquo;m so sorry I totally forgot that she was in here.&rdquo; Peter argued and you could feel your heart sink to your stomach.</p><p>Hearing the click from the door the awkward tension burst with chaos. Ned and Peter began to banter about him being Spiderman and something about the internship. You couldn&rsquo;t really focus. You had seen Peter in gym class and once last summer at a pool party. </p><p>His physique hadn&rsquo;t been that good at the time. Your mind was tracing every line of his muscles in my your memory, licking your lips at the idea.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, you should go with Ned.&rdquo; Peters soft voice made your eyes pop open. He had on a shirt but was still in his boxers- at at least the main distraction had passed.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s a good idea.&rdquo; You grabbed your bag, vaugely hearing apologies from Peter as you and Ned left the apartment. </p><p>&ldquo;So, at least now when you tell Peter how you feel you&rsquo;ll knock out two birds with one stone.&rdquo; You groaned at the joke.</p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'>Avengers Upstate New York Present Day</p><p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have let him stay, but the kid just doesn&rsquo;t listen.&rdquo; Tony had been rambling on since you had arrived at the complex. He was silent the ride up and it was then that you knew it couldn&rsquo;t be good.</p><p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have known who to tell, but Parker was so big on home videos- he had tons with you two-and when I saw the mask footage from his old suit&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You still keep track of those, I thought the baby monitor had been removed.&rdquo; Ned interrupted.</p><p>&ldquo;Ned, for the love of god-not now.&rdquo; You hissed.</p><p>&ldquo;He was particularly fond of you.&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s eyes landed on you-the pain in them making you feel like your stomach was receding into a black hole. </p><p>&ldquo;Girlfriend?&rdquo; He asked. You only nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;Fairly recent&hellip;&rdquo; Your voice cracking.</p><p>&ldquo;Then my apologies and sympathy can&rsquo;t be expressed enough.&rdquo; Tonys own voice faltering. </p><p>&ldquo;Tony,&rdquo; you knew you should have called him Mr. Stark- it was only respectful. His body tensed but he didn&rsquo;t turn. You weren&rsquo;t sure of your courage in that second-but you knew there was only one thing you could do- the only thing you could say to make sense of your grief.</p><p>&ldquo;Bring him back.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Kid, if I could&hellip;..&quot;he sniffed &quot;I would.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Not good enough,&rdquo; you growled &ldquo;There must be a way.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N&hellip;.&rdquo; Ned was crying - accepting defeat</p><p>&ldquo;There has to be something.&rdquo; Your tears stung your eyes-you hadn&rsquo;t cried it all out yet.</p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGEmuHvaujYsKoErDdd5CaQ\">@avengers-sweethearts</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOFtz5u4dZwFz7_3-lcI7og\">@butwhyduh</a> </p>",

Peter seemed extra thrilled and extra secretive about anything having to do with Tony Stark. The next few days he was obsessed with rushing home to work on his \u2018Stark internship\u2019. </p><p>\"Does he care at all?\u201d You groaned to Ned as Peter once again dissapeared right after last bell.</p><p>\u201cAbout school, the internship, or you?\u201d Ned countered, not even looking at you. </p><p>You thought about having a smartass comment but came up short, replacing it with a heavy sigh. </p><p>\u201cHe agreed to help with my Lego death star tonight.\u201d Ned\u2019s voice chipper.</p><p>\u201cGreat, he still cares about Star Wars. At least that\u2019s something.\u201d You sighed again. \u201cWanna walk to the neighborhood with me? Since you promised to meet him?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure, don\u2019t you usually\u2026.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalk with Peter, yeah. That doesn\u2019t seem to be happening today.\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cHey there, little smart ass.\u201d Mr. Delmar called out from behind the counter. </p><p>\u201cHey there!\u201d You said waving-not your best comeback, but you just couldn\u2019t seem to find one. Was Peter bothering you that much?</p><p>\u201cYou know, you missed Mr Parker about forty-five minutes ago.\u201d He turned to his colleague speaking rapidly and turning back to you. </p><p>\u201cHe said Parker and girlfriend, must be taking about you\u2026\u201d Ned pushed an elbow into your ribs, you swatted at his hand trying not to blush.</p><p>\u201cSoo, what did the nerd Almighty order today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe number five with pickles.\u201d Mr Delmar sounded bored. </p><p>\u201cTook my advice I see. I\u2019ll have the same and what ever my buddy here wants.\u201d </p><p>\u201cEat here, or walk?\u201d You turned to Ned waiting for his answer.</p><p>\u201cWalk, we\u2019ll head to Pete\u2019s, I\u2019m sure May won\u2019t mind.\u201d </p><p>Walking down the streets of Queens, shoveling your sandwich in your face-you and Ned exchanged small talk between bites.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019m surprised Peter hasn\u2019t caught on to your little crush.\u201d Ned always had a way of bringing it up to you.</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s too busy with the little crush\u2026. Of his own.\u201d You rebutled. Swallowing the massive bite you just took. \u201cI\u2019m as much in the friend zone as you, Ned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could happen,\u201d he shrugged his shoulders-his back pack making a loud jingling. No doubt the Lego pieces. \u201cMaybe you should tell him yourself, sometimes guys like a girl who takes charge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and when I\u2019m done with that I\u2019ll ask Spiderman to go out with me next. Or better yet, Captain America- he\u2019s been single a while now.\u201d </p><p>The two of you had made it to the Parker residence, Peter shockingly wasn\u2019t home yet-it was nearly dark. But May offered his room for you to hang out in while she made dinner. Once again Ned steered the conversation towards you and Peter before you glared at him to stop. </p><p>\u201cThe Death Star is nearly complete, my master.\u201d Ned dropped his voice low, trying his best.</p><p>\u201cWell done, Lord Vader.\u201d You cackled. Finishing the Lego masterpiece in silence, Ned slowly began to lift it from the bed. It was late and Peter still want home-you may as well call it a night.</p><p>But Ned\u2019s eyes went wide, fixated on the cieling. There crawling on all fours, Spiderman suit and all was Peter. You couldn\u2019t breath or even think. He slung a web closing the door silently. </p><p>Landing just as silently on the ground Peter turned meeting your eyes and Ned\u2019s. The crash from your Lego creation falling to the ground made you jump.</p><p>\u201cwhat was that?\u201d May called.</p><p>Peter franticly squeaked out this response, holding out his hand as if that would keep her from entering the room.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the Spiderman\u2026\u201d Ned was stunned.</p><p>Your ears couldn\u2019t make out any sound as you stared at Peters suit. It was a shiny onesie. He slapped at the emblem on his chest, the suit falling I\u2019m a heap at his feet. He was now nearly naked and almost instantly you were in reality again.</p><p>\u201coh Jesus Peter, warn a girl.\u201d You spun around covering your eyes-leaning against the cold bars of his bunk bed ladder.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Sorry\u201d he scrambled around looking for clothes when May walked in.</p><p>\u201cwell that didn\u2019t\u2026.Peter. What \u2026. \u201d She stammered, and you could only guess why. \u201cWhat are you doing? Put some clothes on, Y/N you should come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove to, May. But I can\u2019t really open my eyes at this moment. I\u2019m good here as long as Peter gets dressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAunt May I\u2019m so sorry I totally forgot that she was in here.\u201d Peter argued and you could feel your heart sink to your stomach.</p><p>Hearing the click from the door the awkward tension burst with chaos. Ned and Peter began to banter about him being Spiderman and something about the internship. You couldn\u2019t really focus. You had seen Peter in gym class and once last summer at a pool party. </p><p>His physique hadn\u2019t been that good at the time. Your mind was tracing every line of his muscles in my your memory, licking your lips at the idea.</p><p>\u201cY/N, you should go with Ned.\u201d Peters soft voice made your eyes pop open. He had on a shirt but was still in his boxers- at at least the main distraction had passed.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d You grabbed your bag, vaugely hearing apologies from Peter as you and Ned left the apartment. </p><p>\u201cSo, at least now when you tell Peter how you feel you\u2019ll knock out two birds with one stone.\u201d You groaned at the joke.</p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'>Avengers Upstate New York Present Day</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have let him stay, but the kid just doesn\u2019t listen.\u201d Tony had been rambling on since you had arrived at the complex. He was silent the ride up and it was then that you knew it couldn\u2019t be good.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have known who to tell, but Parker was so big on home videos- he had tons with you two-and when I saw the mask footage from his old suit\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still keep track of those, I thought the baby monitor had been removed.\u201d Ned interrupted.</p><p>\u201cNed, for the love of god-not now.\u201d You hissed.</p><p>\u201cHe was particularly fond of you.\u201d Tony\u2019s eyes landed on you-the pain in them making you feel like your stomach was receding into a black hole. </p><p>\u201cGirlfriend?\u201d He asked. You only nodded.</p><p>\u201cFairly recent\u2026\u201d Your voice cracking.</p><p>\u201cThen my apologies and sympathy can\u2019t be expressed enough.\u201d Tonys own voice faltering. </p><p>\u201cTony,\u201d you knew you should have called him Mr. Stark- it was only respectful. His body tensed but he didn\u2019t turn. You weren\u2019t sure of your courage in that second-but you knew there was only one thing you could do- the only thing you could say to make sense of your grief.</p><p>\u201cBring him back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKid, if I could\u2026..\"he sniffed \"I would.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot good enough,\u201d you growled \u201cThere must be a way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N\u2026.\u201d Ned was crying - accepting defeat</p><p>\u201cThere has to be something.\u201d Your tears stung your eyes-you hadn\u2019t cried it all out yet.</p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGEmuHvaujYsKoErDdd5CaQ\">@avengers-sweethearts</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOFtz5u4dZwFz7_3-lcI7og\">@butwhyduh</a> </p></p>",

But your getting dangerously close.&rdquo;</p><p>Several days later you were shuffling through the apartment making sure you had everything you&rsquo;d need. The day off your project had arrived, Peter had returned to school just in time. </p><p><i>&ldquo;You sure you and Stark had a good time, he seemed kinda occupied with Captain America to be honest. Kinda funny that you had to go to the same place.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see Mr. Stark all the time you know it was just a quick training in you know&hellip; Science management.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Even he looked confused at his excuse.</i></p><p>&rdquo;<i>Right</i>, <i>all I&rsquo;m saying Peter is&hellip;&ldquo;</i></p><p>&rdquo;<i>Can we please not talk about Mr. Stark.&ldquo;</i></p><p>The argument had ended there. Peter seemed extra thrilled and extra secretive about anything having to do with Tony Stark. The next few days he was obsessed with rushing home to work on his &lsquo;Stark internship&rsquo;. </p><p>\"Does he care at all?&rdquo; You groaned to Ned as Peter once again dissapeared right after last bell.</p><p>&ldquo;About school, the internship, or you?&rdquo; Ned countered, not even looking at you. </p><p>You thought about having a smartass comment but came up short, replacing it with a heavy sigh. </p><p>&ldquo;He agreed to help with my Lego death star tonight.&rdquo; Ned&rsquo;s voice chipper.</p><p>&ldquo;Great, he still cares about Star Wars. At least that&rsquo;s something.&rdquo; You sighed again. &ldquo;Wanna walk to the neighborhood with me? Since you promised to meet him?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Sure, don&rsquo;t you usually&hellip;.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Walk with Peter, yeah. That doesn&rsquo;t seem to be happening today.&rdquo;</p><p>***</p><p>&ldquo;Hey there, little smart ass.&rdquo; Mr. Delmar called out from behind the counter. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey there!&rdquo; You said waving-not your best comeback, but you just couldn&rsquo;t seem to find one. Was Peter bothering you that much?</p><p>&ldquo;You know, you missed Mr Parker about forty-five minutes ago.&rdquo; He turned to his colleague speaking rapidly and turning back to you. </p><p>&ldquo;He said Parker and girlfriend, must be taking about you&hellip;&rdquo; Ned pushed an elbow into your ribs, you swatted at his hand trying not to blush.</p><p>&ldquo;Soo, what did the nerd Almighty order today?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The number five with pickles.&rdquo; Mr Delmar sounded bored. </p><p>&ldquo;Took my advice I see. I&rsquo;ll have the same and what ever my buddy here wants.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Eat here, or walk?&rdquo; You turned to Ned waiting for his answer.</p><p>&ldquo;Walk, we&rsquo;ll head to Pete&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m sure May won&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo; </p><p>Walking down the streets of Queens, shoveling your sandwich in your face-you and Ned exchanged small talk between bites.</p><p>&ldquo;You know, I&rsquo;m surprised Peter hasn&rsquo;t caught on to your little crush.&rdquo; Ned always had a way of bringing it up to you.</p><p>&ldquo;Because he&rsquo;s too busy with the little crush&hellip;. Of his own.&rdquo; You rebutled. Swallowing the massive bite you just took. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m as much in the friend zone as you, Ned.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It could happen,&rdquo; he shrugged his shoulders-his back pack making a loud jingling. No doubt the Lego pieces. &ldquo;Maybe you should tell him yourself, sometimes guys like a girl who takes charge.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, and when I&rsquo;m done with that I&rsquo;ll ask Spiderman to go out with me next. Or better yet, Captain America- he&rsquo;s been single a while now.&rdquo; </p><p>The two of you had made it to the Parker residence, Peter shockingly wasn&rsquo;t home yet-it was nearly dark. But May offered his room for you to hang out in while she made dinner. Once again Ned steered the conversation towards you and Peter before you glared at him to stop. </p><p>&ldquo;The Death Star is nearly complete, my master.&rdquo; Ned dropped his voice low, trying his best.</p><p>&ldquo;Well done, Lord Vader.&rdquo; You cackled. Finishing the Lego masterpiece in silence, Ned slowly began to lift it from the bed. It was late and Peter still want home-you may as well call it a night.</p><p>But Ned&rsquo;s eyes went wide, fixated on the cieling. There crawling on all fours, Spiderman suit and all was Peter. You couldn&rsquo;t breath or even think. He slung a web closing the door silently. </p><p>Landing just as silently on the ground Peter turned meeting your eyes and Ned&rsquo;s. The crash from your Lego creation falling to the ground made you jump.</p><p>&ldquo;what was that?&rdquo; May called.</p><p>Peter franticly squeaked out this response, holding out his hand as if that would keep her from entering the room.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the Spiderman&hellip;&rdquo; Ned was stunned.</p><p>Your ears couldn&rsquo;t make out any sound as you stared at Peters suit. It was a shiny onesie. He slapped at the emblem on his chest, the suit falling I&rsquo;m a heap at his feet. He was now nearly naked and almost instantly you were in reality again.</p><p>&ldquo;oh Jesus Peter, warn a girl.&rdquo; You spun around covering your eyes-leaning against the cold bars of his bunk bed ladder.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, Sorry&rdquo; he scrambled around looking for clothes when May walked in.</p><p>&ldquo;well that didn&rsquo;t&hellip;.Peter. What &hellip;. &rdquo; She stammered, and you could only guess why. &ldquo;What are you doing? Put some clothes on, Y/N you should come with me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Love to, May. But I can&rsquo;t really open my eyes at this moment. I&rsquo;m good here as long as Peter gets dressed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aunt May I&rsquo;m so sorry I totally forgot that she was in here.&rdquo; Peter argued and you could feel your heart sink to your stomach.</p><p>Hearing the click from the door the awkward tension burst with chaos. Ned and Peter began to banter about him being Spiderman and something about the internship. You couldn&rsquo;t really focus. You had seen Peter in gym class and once last summer at a pool party. </p><p>His physique hadn&rsquo;t been that good at the time. Your mind was tracing every line of his muscles in my your memory, licking your lips at the idea.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, you should go with Ned.&rdquo; Peters soft voice made your eyes pop open. He had on a shirt but was still in his boxers- at at least the main distraction had passed.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s a good idea.&rdquo; You grabbed your bag, vaugely hearing apologies from Peter as you and Ned left the apartment. </p><p>&ldquo;So, at least now when you tell Peter how you feel you&rsquo;ll knock out two birds with one stone.&rdquo; You groaned at the joke.</p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;quote&quot;}\">Avengers Upstate New York Present Day</p><p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have let him stay, but the kid just doesn&rsquo;t listen.&rdquo; Tony had been rambling on since you had arrived at the complex. He was silent the ride up and it was then that you knew it couldn&rsquo;t be good.</p><p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have known who to tell, but Parker was so big on home videos- he had tons with you two-and when I saw the mask footage from his old suit&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You still keep track of those, I thought the baby monitor had been removed.&rdquo; Ned interrupted.</p><p>&ldquo;Ned, for the love of god-not now.&rdquo; You hissed.</p><p>&ldquo;He was particularly fond of you.&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s eyes landed on you-the pain in them making you feel like your stomach was receding into a black hole. </p><p>&ldquo;Girlfriend?&rdquo; He asked. You only nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;Fairly recent&hellip;&rdquo; Your voice cracking.</p><p>&ldquo;Then my apologies and sympathy can&rsquo;t be expressed enough.&rdquo; Tonys own voice faltering. </p><p>&ldquo;Tony,&rdquo; you knew you should have called him Mr. Stark- it was only respectful. His body tensed but he didn&rsquo;t turn. You weren&rsquo;t sure of your courage in that second-but you knew there was only one thing you could do- the only thing you could say to make sense of your grief.</p><p>&ldquo;Bring him back.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Kid, if I could&hellip;..\"he sniffed \"I would.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Not good enough,&rdquo; you growled &ldquo;There must be a way.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N&hellip;.&rdquo; Ned was crying - accepting defeat</p><p>&ldquo;There has to be something.&rdquo; Your tears stung your eyes-you hadn&rsquo;t cried it all out yet.</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGEmuHvaujYsKoErDdd5CaQ\">@avengers-sweethearts</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOFtz5u4dZwFz7_3-lcI7og\">@butwhyduh</a> </p></p>",
