You\u2019re the best. &lt;3\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17125400\">Read on A03</a></p><!-- more --><p>Dans\nschedule was a proper mess this semester. His decision to specialize in modern\npiano music got frowned upon not only by his parents but also by his Uni, so\nhis curses were not nicely fit together anymore. He had a lot of free time in\nbetween, but his time gaps were too short to get back to his dorm, so he mostly\nstayed on campus, spending his free time in one of the multiple coffee shops\naround or with his friend Louise, who was assigned a dorm room much closer to\ncampus than he was.</p><p>That\u2019s how\nhe caught wind of it first.</p><p>He had\nalways been good at playing the piano, the time at uni had only helped with\nthat, obviously; but that he was supposedly the best in his studies had always\nsounded like an exaggeration. There were a lot of piano students, so he had\ntried toning down the people talking about him, directing them to someone else.\nAside from his musical ability there wasn\u2019t much interesting about him, though,\nso he had drifted out of the other students\u2019 eyes - at least aside from the\ntalk about whoever was supposed to be dating this week. His open bisexuality\nmade for a large pool of possible suitors, but there were students much more\ninteresting to talk about.</p><p>Now,\nthough, he was back inside of the rumor mill, and right in the center.</p><p>It started\noff innocently enough.</p><p>\u201cThe\ninstruments students are doing trios this year, did you hear?\u201d The two girls in\nthe booth right next to his were chatting animatedly with each other, obviously\nunaware of him just sitting half a meter away. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m so excited! We\nhaven\u2019t seen Dan Howell performing for a while, which is a shame. Him at a\nPiano is enough to get me going to be honest.\u201d</p><p>Dan was\nalready puffing out his chest like a peacock, debating on whether to go over\nthere or at least make his presence known otherwise, when the other girl\u2019s\nreply made him halt in his tracks. \u201cI mean\u00a0<i>same\u00a0</i>, but have you\nseen Phil Lester lately? He got rid of his emo fringe and stuff. He\u2019s\nscolding\u00a0<i>hot\u00a0</i>.\u201d She layed extra emphasis on the word hot and\nin Dan\u2019s head, two mindsets started battling over what to do. The first one\nexpressed some kind of jealousy in a \u201cI wanted to tap that girl\u201d-kind of way,\nthe other one wanted to spring onto facebook to check out the guy they were\ntalking about, whose name sounded kind of familiar.</p><p>Former emo\nfringe musician that got hot? Sign him the fuck up.</p><p>Chuckling\nlowly about his screaming bisexuality he continued listening, his interest now\npeaked.</p><p>\u201cWell,\nthey\u2019re doing trios right? Just imagine both of them on stage together\u2026\u201d</p><p>The other\ngirl actually moaned at the thought and Dan couldn\u2019t contain the smirk creeping\non his face. He took a sip from his coffee, his still open laptop on the table\nin front of him long forgotten. He probably should be working on one of his\nassignments due this week, but the girls\u2019 conversation was too interesting to\nignore.</p><p>Dan had to\nsuppress some swearing when his laptop dinged with an incoming email. He could\nhear the girls whispering behind him when they looked over because of the\nsound, realizing who he was - \u201cOh my god is that Dan Howell?\u201d and \u201cOh my god,\ndo you think he heard us?\u201d - \u00a0and he quickly leaned forward to appear busy.</p><p>The email\ncausing the \u2018ding\u2019 was actually about the assignment the girls had just been\ntalking about. He packed up his stuff immediately when he had read through it.\nThe list of assigned groups had just been hung out in front of his professor\u2019s\noffice and she invited all participants to a meeting in about half an hour on\nthe other side of the campus, so he had to rush.</p><p>~~~</p><p>Even the\nrushing didn\u2019t help in the end, the unfortunate incident of a broken down bus\ncosted him the time to check the list before the meeting started. When he got\nthere he still had no idea who his partners were, so he didn\u2019t understand the\nreason behind the quiet whispers that started when he set foot into the lecture\nhall. He managed to find his friend Louise quite fast and slid into the free\nspot next to her. \u201cWhat\u2019s the fuss about?\u201d he asked her quietly but before she\ncould answer, the door opened again and a group of professors walked in.</p><p>Their looks\nvaried about as much as those of the students sitting in the audience, making\nfor a quite colourful group. For this assignment, nearly all rock-centered\ncurses were thrown together, not only piano but also guitar, drums, bass,\nviolin and multiple other instruments. The hall was packed full, but the\narrival of the professors assured silence among the students.</p><p>\u201cGood\nmorning everyone! Hopefully you all checked the list and are in the process of\ncontacting your partners. Teamwork is the key for this assignment! Because of\nthe number of students most groups consist of one piano student, one guitar\nstudent and one of another instrument, specifically arranged to play into your\nstrengths and make you work on your weaknesses.\u201d The young male professor\u2019s\nvoice rung soundly through the hall and Dan couldn\u2019t help but raise an eyebrow.\nProf. Smith, responsible for the guitar department and \u00a0specialized on\nrock music, was so completely different from his own professor and so clich\u00e9\nrock musician that it offended Dan\u2019s believes; he fit the stereotype perfectly,\nincluding tattoo covered arms, piercings and wild, green hair, often sporting\nband shirts.</p><p>Prof.\nJohnson, on the other hand, was nothing like her profession. She was a\nmiddle-aged woman with slim, neon green glasses and grey eyes that always\nseemed to shine with mischief. Her jet black hair fell in untamable curls onto\nher shoulders and she seemed to never leave the house without a nerdy T-Shirt,\nmerch for some comic, TV-Show or movie. When she stepped forward, the whispers\naround the hall got louder and the grin on her face was so wide Dan couldn\u2019t\nhelp but grin back. He liked his Professor, even if she tended to overstep her\nboundaries and was eager to make friends among the students.</p><p>\u201cIf you\nhave questions you can always turn to me or Mr. Smith, Mr. Miller or Mrs.\nAdams, or any of the other Professors involved,\u201d she said, then paused for a\nsecond to let the murmures and voices ring out.</p><p>\u201cNow, we\nknow this is a big thing among the student body, but we hope you can keep it as\nlow as possible. Drama and relations, as fun as they are to watch for us, will\nonly make your work harder. If you want to outplay this though, be assured I\nwill be watching with a glass of wine and popcorn.\u201d There were chuckles among\nthe group and Louise next to him went red trying to keep in her laughter. Dan\ngrinned at her and made a mental note to tell her about the girls he had\nencountered before coming here.</p><p><br/>\nIt took some time for the students to calm down, but when she continued\nspeaking, Dan was shocked into silence. \u201cThat also goes for other students\naside from yourself. The list is out for half an hour and the only duo\ninvolving Mr. Howell and Mr. Lester has already caused an uproar throughout the\nwhole university, so please think about what you are causing when you speak\nabout information like this next time.\u201d</p><p>The rest of\nthe meeting went by in a blur. The professors informed them of the nature of\nthe assignment - the whole thing had pretty much the built-up of a generic\ntalent show. They had to cover one song each week in an open, on-campus concert\nstarting in two weeks. Each week two groups would be voted out by the\nprofessors until three groups remained for the finale.</p><p>At the end\nDan didn\u2019t remember anything the professors had explained to them. He would beg\nLouise for her notes tomorrow, but that wasn\u2019t the important thing right now.</p><p>The\nimportant thing was that he was supposed to perform with the one and only Phil\nLester - and after a quick facebook check he realized why the name had sounded\nso familiar. Dan had had a crush on the cute and amazingly talented guitar\nplayer performing every saturday in a close-by coffee shop for weeks until he\nhad disappeared. What made it even harder for Dan was the fact that the girls\nhad been right.</p><p>The guy had\ngotten\u00a0<i>hot as fuck</i>.</p><p>Louise\u2019\nmumbled\u00a0<i>keep it in your pants\u00a0</i>seemed almost impossible to\nstick to.</p><p>~~~~</p><p>It took Dan\naround half a week to stop running from Phil. He kept himself busy with papers\nnot due for at least a few more weeks and working harder for other assignments\nthan he ever had before - he did anything that would make him forget about the\nshort message from Phil awaiting him on whatsapp, where he introduced himself\nand informed him they were partners. The little dog emoji at the end of the\nmessage made him squeal like a schoolgirl, but that was exactly the problem. He\nhad to keep it professional. Which would be difficult considering the increasingly\nhot pictures Phil posted on his facebook and instagram\u2026</p><p>On thursday\nDan finally realized he wouldn\u2019t be able to hide from this forever, as he\ncouldn\u2019t afford to fail this class. So he decided to suck it up and went with a\ngeneric confirmation and the question to set a time for their first rehearsal\nas a reply.</p><p>On friday\nDan was about as nervous as he could be. Fidgeting the entire morning, he\nchanged his outfit for at least five times until Louise threatened to rip his\nwhole wardrobe to shreds if he didn&rsquo;t decide soon. Her teasing didn\u2019t make his\njob any easier though. He was supposed to meet Phil in less than half an hour\nin one of the practice rooms in the music building half a campus away and he\nwas dying a little.</p><p>\u201cDo you\nreally think I look okay?\u201d he asked Louise, who was seated directly next to him\non the bus, anxiously running his fingers through his brown locks. Louise\ncaught his wrist mid-movement and forced his hand back into his lap before she\npatted it sympathetically. \u201cYou look great, Dan. Just don\u2019t behave like the\nlittle schoolgirl you\u2019re portraying right now, okay?\u201d</p><p>Dan\ncouldn\u2019t get rid of the blush creeping onto his cheeks for the rest of the bus\nride.</p><p>When he\narrived at their booked practice room, Phil wasn\u2019t there yet. Sighing in\nrelief, he let his backpack sink to the floor before moving over to the piano,\nsituated on a little pedestal in front of the window. He took a seat on the\nstool right in front of it and let his fingers run over the keys testingly. A\nseries of notes rang through the air and he realized delightedly that the piano\nwas pitched precisely.</p><p>He let his\nfingers push the keys purposefully and before he knew it they strung together\nto one of his favorite songs. He started singing along, just for the fun of it;\nbut he got completely lost in the music. At one point a second voice joined in,\nharmonizing with him to an unbelievable extend, but he didn\u2019t even realize; it\njust sounded like it had been there from the start.</p><p>Like it\nbelonged there, ringing alongside his own.</p><p>Only at the\nend of the song he realized what had happened. When the last note rang loud\nthrough the now deafening silence he whipped around, eyes wide - and met the\nbluest eyes he had ever seen.</p><p>He wanted\nto avert his eyes, wanted to check who it was, but he couldn\u2019t; for a few\nmoments, he was frozen, lost in time, no connection to reality except for the\nblue he was drowning in.</p><p>The moment\nshattered like glass around him when some kind of crashing noise pierced in\nfrom outside of the room and Dan was finally able to move his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThat was\nbeautiful,\u201d a deep, melodic voice said and he couldn\u2019t help but stare at the\nblack haired figure standing proudly and tall at the other end of the piano,\nsmiling at him reassuringly.</p><p>Dan had to\nblink a few times and pinch himself covertly, but the picture in front of him\nstayed the same: Phil Lester, in all his delicious glory, eyes shining so\nbright Dan was sure he\u2019d need sunglasses.</p><p>\u201cIt was,\u201d\nhe agreed with a raspy voice, watching wordlessly as Phil made his way over to\nhim. \u201cI\u2019m Phil,\u201d he said, sticking out his hand in front of him and Dan had to\ngulp down his fast rising excitement.\u00a0<i>I\u2019ll get to touch Phil Lester!!</i></p><p>When it happened,\nwhen their hands touched, he almost flinched back. A warm feeling shot up his\narm at top speed and for a second, he forgot how to breathe.\u00a0<i>Holy shit.</i></p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d he\nrasped back, staring up at Phil with wide eyes, not really sure what to do with\nhimself, only one thought ringing through his mind - if touching Phil felt\nlike\u00a0<i>that\u00a0</i>, how amazing would kissing him be?</p><p>Obviously,\nthe black haired guitar player was not as shocked as Dan. \u201cSo, do you think we\nfound our song for the first show?\u201d</p><p>Just like\nthat they slipped over into work - and working with Phil, Dan learned, was just\nas easy as breathing.</p><p>~~~</p><p>The first\nweek with Phil was like walking on clouds. The numerous holes in Dan\u2019s schedule\nmade for good practice times, and the fact that Phil didn\u2019t have many classes\nthis semester meant that he was there for almost every one of them. Work flowed\neasily and smoothly and on monday they were already done segmenting the song\nand deciding who would get to sing which parts.</p><p>But not\nonly the work went great, even their voices harmonized like they were meant to\nbe heard together. They didn\u2019t even need transitions between Dan\u2019s singing\nparts to Phil\u2019s, the changes from line to line went just as smoothly as the\nones with longer instrumental intervals between.</p><p>Tuesday\nevening they were basically ready to perform. Dan had his piano playing\nrecorded as a playback to make him more flexible on stage instead of immobile\nbehind a giant instrument. Phil\u2019s guitar skills maybe didn\u2019t quite match Jimmy\nHendrik\u2019s yet, but they were definitely up there, and he had the song down to a\nT. Neither of them had classes the next morning, so as they were leaving the\npractice room, Dan felt quite courageous from all the adrenaline still rushing\nthrough him after a perfect run - and he boldly asked Phil if he wanted to get\na coffee somewhere before retiring to their respective dorms.</p><p>Ten minutes\nlater they were sat in a coffee shop right off campus. Dan chose a cozy little\nbooth in the corner directly next to the window front while Phil went to get\ntheir coffees. When Dan took the first sip of his drink he almost spat it right\nback out, but instead moved to first eye the drink and then Phil suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cHow do you\nknow?\u201d he asked, his voice almost high pitched as he narrowed his eyes.</p><p><br/>\nPhil just raised an eyebrow into an almost perfectly shaped curve, looking at\nDan questionably as he calmly took a sip of his coffee, not saying a word.</p><p>\u201cHow do you\nknow my order?\u201d Dan specified and watched incredulously as Phil\u2019s full,\u00a0<i>kissable\u00a0</i>lips\nspread into a wide grin. He could almost picture it, attaching his own lips\nonto his as they spread into the exact grin before the kisses started to get\nmore serious, more heated, Phil\u2019s fringe messed up, his cheeks red as clothes\nwere coming off\u2026</p><p><i>Oh my\ngod, stop betraying me, goddamn heart.</i></p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t.\nI just ordered two of my usual order.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s\nvoice ripped him out of his daydream and for a second he couldn\u2019t do much else\nthan stare in stunned silence. \u201cYou drink caramel Macchiato, too?\u201d he asked,\nblinking. Huh. He really hadn\u2019t expected that from a guy as\u00a0<i>hot\u00a0</i>as\nhim\u2026</p><p><i>Jesus\nfucking christ, actually shut the fuck up!</i></p><p>Dan\u2019s\nattraction to Phil had risen to an unhealthy level by now. Not only was he hot\nas fuck, no; during their practice time Dan also had had to learn that the guy\nwas smart, funny, lively, and talented as\u00a0<i>fuck\u00a0</i>, even more than\nDan remembered him to be. Dan was lucky the assignment, and working on the\nmusic kept him busy and focused, or else he would have probably jumped the guy\nby now.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my\nall time favorite,\u201d Phil confirmed, his grin transforming into a cheeky smile, and\nDan couldn\u2019t keep a blush from dusting his cheeks pink.</p><p>\u201cMine too,\u201d\nhe admitted and took another tentative sip from his drink, purposefully\navoiding Phil\u2019s eyes. He knew that if he looked into them now, he would\u00a0<i>drown\u00a0</i>in\nthem.</p><p>For a few\nmoments it was silent between them, both nursing their coffee, Dan deeply lost\nin thought about the blueness of Phil\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cSo, Muse,\nhuh?\u201d</p><p>It was Phil\nbreaking the silence and Dan looked up, surprised. It took him a second to\nrealize how Phil had even known he liked\u00a0<i>Muse\u00a0</i>, until he\nrealized they had met while singing their song\u00a0<i>Thought Contagion\u00a0</i>before\nchoosing it for their first performance. This time he was pretty sure he kept\nthe blush at bay.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\nlove them.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s\nmouth stretched into a happy smile, his eyes shining brightly, full of honest\nexcitement as he started chattering about them. Dan had to gulp and pinch his\nhand unsuspiciously to keep himself from losing his\u00a0<i>mind\u00a0</i>.</p><p>They moved\nfrom\u00a0<i>Muse\u00a0</i>to\u00a0<i>Panic!\u00a0</i>to\u00a0<i>Fallout\nBoy\u00a0</i>to\u00a0<i>Paramore\u00a0</i>and even further. Albums became\nscores, which lead the way to games, movies and TV shows. It was almost scary\nhow much they had in common, how much their interests overlapped, and it\nactually took Dan a while to remember a question he\u2019d had since he\u2019d heard of\nthe assigned groups.</p><p>He used a\ntemporary lull in conversation - one that he could have easily filled with\nsomething relatable to the topic they were on, mind you - to finally ask.</p><p>\u201cBy the\nway, do you know why we are the only duo?\u201d</p><p>Phil raised\nhis eyebrow, a cheeky smile back on his face and Dan knew there was a blush\ncreeping up his cheeks yet again. He couldn\u2019t help but feel like he missed\nsomething vital here, but he had no idea what exactly.</p><p>\u201cDid you\nnot pay attention at the meeting?\u201d</p><p>Dan felt\nhis eyes widen in surprise and blinked, cheeks even hotter than before. \u201cI\nmight have been\u2026\u00a0<i>preoccupied\u00a0</i>,\u201d he admitted and Phil\u2019s smile\ngrew into a full-blown grin.</p><p>\u201cProf.\nJohnson and Prof. Smith spent like ten minutes explaining,\u201d he informed Dan,\n\u201cApparently the numbers didn\u2019t match up and they had to have one duo, so they\nboth chose their best student and realized we would be a good\u00a0<i>match</i>.\u201d\nHe put special emphasis on the word\u00a0<i>match</i>\u00a0and for a second,\nDan wasn\u2019t sure if he would be able to stay conscious. Was he just making a\njoke\u2026 Or was Phil Lester\u00a0<i>really</i>\u00a0<i>flirting</i>\u00a0with him?</p><p>\u201cWe - we\nare,\u201d he stammered in response and Phil\u2019s chuckling send his heart into\noverdrive. Oh god. How was he supposed to survive at least 2 more months\nworking with the guy?</p><p>\u201cI think so\ntoo,\u201d Phil whispered back with a husky voice, making Dan choke on his long cold\ncoffee.</p><p><i>Fuck,\nthese next weeks are going to be torture.</i></p><p>~~~</p><p>The next\nmonday morning Dan found himself in yet another on-campus coffee shop, putting\nthe finishing touches on an assignment that was due today. Normally it was a\nbreak he would spend with Phil, but he had stuff to arrange with one of his\nprofessors, so they decided he would join up with Dan as soon as he was able\nto. They had managed to get a headstart on this week\u2019s performance by starting\nworking on it on saturday, so they weren\u2019t in much of a rush. They had decided\non a song and discussed divisioning on sunday already; it was only practicing left.</p><p>Of course\nthe performance on Friday had gone great. They had gotten a lot of applause by\nthe watching students, the little hall on campus used for performances had been\npacked to the rim, so there had been at least a few hundred watchers. The\nprofessors had obviously also been satisfied with their presentation,\nconsidering they had informed them they would progress into the next round even\nbefore the whole show had been over.</p><p>So Dan and\nPhil had spent their Friday night celebrating. Even though neither of them were\nreally the party going type, they had agreed to go out for a few drinks with\ntheir best friends Louise and PJ - who, coincidentally, were in the same group\n- and Tyler, a music production student Dan had been friends with for years. He\nhad flirted with Phil quite obviously and had teased Dan for his sour mood\nafterwards, but had assured him that\u00a0<i>Phil only has eyes for you, you\ndumbass, pay attention!</i>, coupled with a playful whack on his head.</p><p>The memory\nlet Dan grumble absently, but the arriving of a group of students in the booth\nright behind him ripped him away from his trip down memory lane. \u201cI mean,\nthey\u2019re both bisexual, right?\u201d one of the girls stated while taking a seat,\nmaking him peek up immediately. He liked to hear stories about his fellow\nunicorns and regretted only becoming aware of this conversation after it had\nalready started.</p><p>\u201cThey are,\u201d\na guy\u2019s voice confirmed. Dan was pretty sure he had heard the voice before, but\nhe didn\u2019t have the courage to turn around and check. He was lucky enough to not\nhave been spotted by the group, he really didn\u2019t have to push his luck.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen\ntheir sexual tension? I know you want to fuck them both, Caleb, but come on.\u201d\nThe female voice was followed by a male groan and the sound of a head meeting\nthe tabletop. \u201cI knowww,\u201d was the answer, \u201cI\u2019m sexually deprived, not\u00a0<i>blind\u00a0</i>.\u201d</p><p>Dan raked\nhis brain, trying to figure out who they were talking about. Being friends with\nLouise and Tyler meant that he was mostly up to date with recent campus gossip,\nand he really wanted to tell them about this later.</p><p>\u201cDid you\nknow there\u2019s already a bet going on? About if they\u2019ll be dating by the end of\nthis semester.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich\nidiot would even bet against that?\u201d</p><p>The booth\nerupted into laughter and Dan furrowed his eyebrows, thinking. He leaned\nforward, trying to appear busy, but in reality the assignment currently open on\nhis laptop was the furthest thing from his mind.</p><p>\u201cOkay, but\naside from all that they were the best group, even if it was just the two of\nthem. They\u2019re gonna win this thing, hands down.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes\nwent as wide as saucers as realization seeped into him. They weren\u2019t really\ntalking about -</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u00a0<i>Thought\nContagion\u00a0</i>was brilliant, I\u2019m so excited to see what they\u2019ll come up\nwith for the next round.\u201d</p><p>That was\nthe moment Phil decided to make his appearance, ripping him out of his thoughts\nalmost violently. \u201cMorning!\u201d he said, cheerfully, two cups of steaming coffee\nin his hands. He pushed one of them over to Dan after he had taken a seat.</p><p>A look of\nconfusion, even concern appeared on his face when Dan didn\u2019t react, just\ncontinued staring at his laptop screen with his eyes wide open. \u201cDan? Are you\nokay? Have you seen a ghost?\u201d</p><p>The chatter\nbehind him ended immediately. When he slowly turned around a group of seven\npeople was staring at him, wide eyed. All of them scrambled to their feets as\nfast as they could. \u201cYou\u2019re a cute couple!\u201d one of the girls squeaked out, then\nthey were gone, leaving Dan to explain the situation to Phil.</p><p>Needless to\nsay Phil wasn\u2019t fazed at all, instead he used the story to make more flirty\nremarks, making Dan blush yet again.</p><p><i>Damn,\nI\u2019m fucked.</i></p><p>~~~~</p><p><br/>\nAlmost three months passed by in a rush and by december Dan couldn\u2019t even\nrecognize his life anymore. All the time he had previously spent alone in front\nof his laptop, browsing tumblr or watching Netflix, converted into Phil-time,\nslowly but surely. They played games or watched TV-Shows nearly every day after\npractice. Dan\u2019s roommate had even asked him if he was moving out with all the\ntime he spent away, but Dan couldn\u2019t help himself. Phil lived in a flat near\ncampus all alone. A tiny flat, sure, but it made for the best meetup place,\nespecially for gaming or movie nights or for research about their next song -\nand it gave them some privacy. Not that much had happened yet aside from the\nincreasingly flirty comments and occasional cuddle sessions, but it still made\ntheir friendship easier.</p><p>Especially\nbecause they were now something like campus-famous and got recognized wherever\nthey went.</p><p>So far,\nthey had aced most performances and were through to the last show before\nchristmas break. After New Year\u2019s there was only one show left before the big\nfinale. They were pretty sure they had a good grade secured, but they still\ngave it their all - they had come so far, there was no way they were giving up\nnow.</p><p>In the\nupcoming show only seven groups were left and it was the first one with two\nmandatory songs, one optional and one christmas themed, dropping the\u00a0<i>rock\u00a0</i>theme\njust for this once. Since the last week was cut short - Christmas break started\non thursday - they had an additional half week to prepare. Dan and Phil had\ndecided on\u00a0<i>Panic!\u00a0</i>\u2019s\u00a0<i>High Hopes\u00a0</i>for the first\nsong and\u00a0<i>Last Christmas\u00a0</i>for the second and as always, they had\nbeen quite fast with their work. They were practiced and basically done on\nMonday, so they allowed themselves the night off. Phil\u2019s brother was in town\nand Dan had\u00a0<i>heartlessly neglected\u00a0</i>Tyler since the assignment\nstarted (his words), basically forcing Dan to spent the night with him.</p><p>Fortunately\nTyler had a lecture early the next morning, so he wasn\u2019t trying to get himself\nor Dan trashed. He did, however, made use of the time by grilling Dan about his\nrelationship to Phil.</p><p>Dan was a\nbit annoyed, but at the end of the day he was glad to be able to talk about it,\neven if he would never admit to that. Louise and her group were still in the\nrun for the finals too, which made her so busy they barely were able to talk\nfor longer than a few minutes at a time - and he desperately needed an\noutsider\u2019s opinion.</p><p>It took him\nalmost an hour to get Tyler up to date on what had happened, all the while\ngetting interrupted by texts from Phil. Right when he was done explaining his\nphone dinged again, indicating another text.</p><p><i>\u2018the\ngirl two tables over has a cute lil pup on her lap i keep staring she probs\nthinks i&rsquo;m a perv help\u2019\u00a0</i>it read and he couldn\u2019t help but chuckle. Tyler inspected him warily\nfrom across the table, absently playing with the straw in his half-empty\ncocktail. \u201cOkay, who are you texting?\u201d he asked then, fixing Dan with a steely\ngaze.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s\njust Phil,\u201d he answered distractedly, typing a quick response before turning\nhis attention back to Tyler. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you\nshitting me?\u201d he asked back, a fitting expression on his face like he couldn\u2019t\nbelieve what he was hearing. Dan just answered with a surprised \u201chuh?\u201d,\nshooting him a confused look.</p><p>\u201cMate, how\ndense can you be? You are basically dating the guy, only without the good\nparts!\u201d</p><p>Dan\nblinked, completely lost now, unable to follow Tyler\u2019s train of thought.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and\nPhil are dating, Dan, wake up! The only thing missing is the sex!\u201d\u00a0<br/><br/>\nDan was stunned into silence, staring at Tyler like he had grown a second head.\nIt took the thought a while to register in his brain, but then he blushed,\ntaking a huge gulp of his drink before calling the waiter over to order another\none.</p><p>He needed\nmore alcohol for this.</p><p>~~~~</p><p>The show on\nwednesday evening went exceptionally well. They had the most fun rocking\nto\u00a0<i>High Hopes\u00a0</i>and got really festive during\u00a0<i>Last\nChristmas\u00a0</i>, with Dan at the Piano and Phil sat on top of it. Their\nprofessors called them over and into the next show immediately, making them\ngiddy and high on adrenaline in the process.</p><p>The\nchristmas party thrown by the rock music department started directly afterwards\nand PJ and Louise, immensely proud of their best friends even though their own\ngroup had been voted out, insisted on going. Still in an after show rush they\nagreed, but soon realized why they normally didn\u2019t like parties. It was loud,\nthe room stuffed with people and the food was average at best, and it took them\naround twenty minutes to revert back to the snacks table, where they hid from\nthe actual party.</p><p>When Louise,\nPJ and Tyler of all people found them, sporting a cheeky expression, Dan knew\nthey were fucked. They were leaning against a wall, talking and laughing with\neach other as much as the music allowed them to, and only a few people were\ninspecting them from afar.</p><p>\u201cDo you\nknow where you\u2019re standing?\u201d PJ asked when the group was within earshot and Dan\nraised an eyebrow. \u201cNext to the snacks table where we always are?\u201d he remarked\ndrily, making Phil chuckle next to him.</p><p>\u201cLook up!\u201d\nTyler singsonged with a high pitched voice and flattered his eyelashes with\nfaked innocence.</p><p>Dan perked\nup immediately. He knew that voice.</p><p>He didn\u2019t\neven need to look up to know what was fixated on the wall over their heads.</p><p>\u201cA\nMistletoe!\u201d Louise grinned so widely Dan was sure it had to hurt. He turned his\nattention to Phil, his heart throbbing in his chest on full speed.</p><p>There was a\ncheeky smile on the guitarist\u2019s face as he took a step closer, taking a hold of\nDan\u2019s head with both hands. \u201cThey want a kiss,\u201d he murmured, lowly, \u201clet\u2019s give\nthem a kiss.\u201d</p><p>The second\nhis lips met Phil\u2019s was like a firework going off everywhere inside of his\nbody. For a moment he forgot where he was, hell, even who he was, just\ncontinued kissing Phil with passion and lust and love. He didn\u2019t even hesitate\nopening up his mouth at Phil\u2019s silent request to let him in, too far gone to\ncare - hell, to even\u00a0<i>realize\u00a0</i>they had an audience.</p><p>The kiss\nlasted for minutes and it probably could have gone on much longer if there\nwouldn\u2019t have been a sudden outburst of applause. The blood took a second to\nreach Dan\u2019s brain after having rushed somewhere south only seconds ago, but\nwhen it did, it immediately spread into his cheeks. They broke apart, Dan\u2019s\nface still in Phil\u2019s hands, silently contemplating the recent event.</p><p>He had just\nkissed Phil Lester. In front of basically the whole rock music department.</p><p><i>Great.\nJust great.</i></p><p>The\napplause and whooping didn\u2019t stop soon and he couldn\u2019t do much more then to\nexchange a long look with Phil. They had a silent discussion Dan himself didn\u2019t\nknow the content of, until suddenly and with no indication there was panic on\nPhil\u2019s face as he hastily let go of Dan and scrambled to get his phone out of\nhis pocket. It was vibrating violently in his hands and Dan couldn\u2019t even blink\nby the time Phil rasped out a \u201cShit! My brother is waiting for me!\u201d and left in\na rush.</p><p>Dan stood\nthere, staring after Phil until most of the students had averted their gazes\nfrom him and went back to whatever they had been doing before. When the ice in\nhis veins freezing him into place finally dissipated, he groaned. He knew\nPhil\u2019s brother Martyn was picking him up for Christmas with their family, and\nhe wouldn\u2019t be back until january.</p><p><i>Of\ncourse. That\u2019s just my fucking luck.</i></p><p>~~~</p><p>He spent\nchristmas break in some sort of limbo, like his relationship to Phil was\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat, platonic and romantic at the same time. He knew the kiss had\nmeant something not only to him but also to Phil, that much had been obvious\nwith the way he had taken the offensive in deepening the kiss and how he had\nheld him afterwards. But that was about the amount of information Dan had, and\nneither of them mentioned the kiss on any level, so he decided to just ignore\nthe issue for now.</p><p>It did made\nhim jumpy and fidgety and mostly unable to focus, though, and only his frequent\nskype calls with Phil got him focused and concentrated enough to get some much\nneeded work done.</p><p>There were\nonly two shows left, but they were only one week apart and both required three\nsongs, so they decided to learn all songs over the break. They spent hours on\nskype, deciding on the songs and how to play and sing them, so they would be\ndone learning their personal parts until they could meet back up in person.</p><p>For a short\nmoment, their reunion was like the sun had risen again. They hugged, soft words\nof attachment and longing on their lips, but then it was like someone had\nflipped a switch and they were back in working mode. Phil didn\u2019t mention the\nkiss and Dan didn\u2019t dare to, so they went back to Status Quo, just like that.</p><p>The first\nshow in the new year went okay-ish. Neither of them poured everything into it,\nalready looking forward to the songs they had chosen for the finale, but they\nstill managed to pull through. Their only truly memorable performance was\u00a0<i>The\nBlack Parade\u00a0</i>by\u00a0<i>My Chemical Romance\u00a0</i>, which they\ndefinitely aced, but the other ones admittedly fell a bit flat. Both their\nprofessors urged them to not take it too lightly just because they had done so\namazingly until now, so they swore to give everything they had in their last\nperformances together.</p><p>They were\nthe first group performing in the finale. It wasn\u2019t hard for Dan to get in the\nmood of their songs, considering they were all pining lovesongs and he would\nhave the one he was pining after up on stage with him, so he was glad they got\nto go first. It made the waiting and anticipation in between easier, and\nwaiting for the results when they were done didn\u2019t mean much to him anyway - he\ndidn\u2019t care too much about winning.</p><p>He just\nwanted to give his best, pour all his feelings into the songs when he was up\nthere with Phil. He wanted to make it obvious that he meant every word he was\nsinging.</p><p>He wanted\nto get Phil to understand\u2026</p><p>In short,\nhe just wanted Phil.</p><p>Their first\nsong was a soft piano interpretation of\u00a0<i>It\u2019s not living (If it\u2019s not\nwith you)\u00a0</i>by\u00a0<i>The 1975\u00a0</i>, and Dan was so entranced by\nPhil he forgot to look at his hands while playing. He didn\u2019t make a single\nmistake, thankfully, \u00a0but if he would have made one he probably wouldn\u2019t\neven have noticed. He benefited from the fact that he had practiced the piano\npart so often on the tiny piano in his childhood bedroom that his parents had\nasked him to please,\u00a0<i>please\u00a0</i>stop.</p><p>They spent\ntheir break with a bottle of coke huddled together on a tiny sofa backstage,\nmaking loose conversation and trying to get their mind off of things. Dan\nbasked in the close physical proximity and simply smiled when Phil just\ncasually took his hand while he talked, playing with his fingers. He had a\nfeeling that things would be going well.</p><p>Dan had\nparticularly fun during their next song.\u00a0<i>The Last Of The Real\nOnes\u00a0</i>by\u00a0<i>Fallout Boy\u00a0</i>was one of his favorite songs and\nhe connected a lot of the lyrics to Phil. The piano playing was not an issue\nthis time since they had both laid down their playing previously and conjoined\nit in a track, so he had all the time in the world to focus on Phil, which he\ntook full advantage of. They riled up the crowd so much that Tyler, who had agreed\nto be the presenter of the night, had trouble getting them back in check for\nthe next group.</p><p>During\nchristmas break, far away from Phil and his feelings, their next song had\nseemed like a good idea. It was romantic, emotional and full of love and Dan\ncouldn\u2019t think of any other song that would make his feelings for Phil more\nclear than this.</p><p>Now,\nthough, it seemed entirely too personal to perform in front of what felt like\nthe whole Uni. During practice he had refrained from building too much of a\nconnection, afraid of taking it too far, but now he didn\u2019t have much of a\nchoice and it made him more nervous than any other performance before. His\nhands were sweaty, his stomach was rumbling and he was ready to cancel the\nwhole thing when Phil noticed the state he was in.</p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d he\nwhispered, pointedly ignoring the other people lounging around backstage,\ncompletely focusing on Dan, \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay.\u00a0<i>You\u00a0</i>will be okay.\nAnd I will be with you, right there by your side the whole time, okay?\u201d</p><p>It was in\nthis moment that something settled in Dan\u2019s chest. He returned Phil\u2019s fond look\nwith courage and determination, grasping his hand in his and squeezing it\ntightly. \u201cMe too. We\u2019re on the same page.\u201d</p><p>He was sure\nPhil caught the double meaning when his look got soft. \u201cI think I always knew,\u201d\nhe answered quietly, almost inaudible. \u201cLet\u2019s do this.\u201d</p><p>~~~</p><p>Their last\nperformance of this assignment was a complete success. They performed\u00a0<i>The\nOnly Exception\u00a0</i>by\u00a0<i>Paramore\u00a0</i>sitting huddled together\non the little Piano stool in front of the huge piano and didn\u2019t take their eyes\noff of each other the entire time. It was so emotional Tyler had tears in his\neyes when he came on stage, hugging first Phil, then Dan tightly, muttering a\nsoft \u201cgo get \u2018em, tiger\u201d into Dan\u2019s ear and Dan could feel his heart swelling.</p><p>This was\nit.</p><p>Backstage,\nthankfully, they were alone. Both of the other groups were nowhere to be seen,\nand Phil obviously noticed faster than him.</p><p>Before he\neven had the chance to turn around from closing the door he was already spun\naround and pressed against the next hard surface, Phil\u2019s lips attacking his\nown.</p><p>For what\nfelt like ages they were kissing furiously, like they had deprived themselves\nof this for far too long and now a dam had been broken down, nothing holding\nthem back anymore.</p><p>Once they\nwere out of breath Phil separated their lips, lovingly gazing into his eyes\ninstead. \u201cI have waited for this for far too long,\u201d he whispered quietly,\nsoftly, his hands on the sides of Dan\u2019s head, his thumbs gently caressing his\ncheeks.</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d\nhe mumbled back, drowning in Phil\u2019s eyes and feeling himself falling, falling;\nfalling even deeper in love with him. \u201cI meant every word I sang.\u201d</p><p>There was a\nbeat of quiet, then:</p><p>\u201cI love\nyou.\u201d</p><p>The words\nwere muttered completely simultaneously, and for the single bat of an eye both\nstared at the other, stunned into silence.</p><p>Then they\nwere both dissolving into giggles, holding onto the other to keep from toppling\nover.</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d\nPhil gasped out, \u201cwas so us.\u201d</p><p>Dan\ncouldn\u2019t help but agree.</p><p>~~~</p><p>\u201cDo you\nreally think so, Badiha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\nknow, Henry, but they did seem smitten during that song, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue!\u201d</p><p>There was a\ngroup of at least five people seated in the booth directly behind Dan\u2019s and\neven though he wasn\u2019t that much of a gossip he couldn\u2019t help but eavesdrop. He\nwas busily procrastinating the work he needed to do until the next day,\nrefreshing tumblr around ten times a minute, so it wasn\u2019t too surprising the\nconversation distracted him as soon as it got loud enough for him to hear.</p><p>\u201cBut they\nhaven\u2019t been seen in public with each other in ages aside from their\nperformances. I just really want them to be happy with each other, is that too\nmuch to ask?\u201d</p><p>That was\nthe first voice again. Dan allowed himself a short look at the group out of the\ncorner of his eyes and recognized all faces he was able to pick up on. They had\nall been to the performance Phil and him did twice a week in a near bar ever\nsince their joint assignment last year, he was sure of it. He mostly recognized\nthem because of the person that had spoken first, a girl with the pride flag\ndrawn on her eyelids. He remembered how she had attracted his attention during\ntheir first show because of her truly iconic makeup.</p><p>\u201cI know,\nright?!\u201d a male voice joined in and this time Dan didn\u2019t need the information\npractically jumping into his face to realize they were talking about him and\nPhil.</p><p>After their\nwin in the finale they had decided to keep their relationship at a down low,\ntrying to make themselves comfortable with being boyfriends before they truly\nmade it public. They were still pretty famous throughout the students and the\ncenter of the rumor mill, but they had been in a relationship for almost a year\nnow and had only recently realized there was nothing to be afraid of if\neverybody knew. Most of them would be happy for them, and the rest of them,\nwell -</p><p>They\u2019d just\nhave to suck it up.</p><p>That was\nthe moment his boyfriend decided to show up. He slid into the booth, taking a\nseat directly next to Dan, pressing their thighs together. \u201cMorning, love,\u201d he\ngreeted Dan gently, planting a kiss on his cheek before grinning happily. \u201cBusy\nprocrastinating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dan\nreplied extra loud, grinning right back, \u201cbut I\u2019d rather kiss my boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>So they\nshared a short, cute kiss, making the group behind them gasp loudly. \u201cIt\u2019s\nthem,\u201d the girl with the pride flag on her eyelids whispered into the silence\nstretching between them. Dan grinned.</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d he\nconfirmed cheekily, turning around to look at her. \u201cVery iconic Make-up by the\nway, I like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god,\nthank you,\u201d she answered, a blush becoming apparent on her cheeks and Dan\u2019s\ngrin only got wider before he turned his attention back around to Phil.</p><p>\u201cWhat was\nthat about?\u201d he asked with a raised eyebrow and his head cutely tilted to the\nside.</p><p>Dan pecked\nhim on the lips. \u201cHad to make a point.\u201d</p><p>Phil looked\nback cheekily, a grin on his face so wide Dan was able to see his tongue poking\nout between his teeth. \u201cA point about what?\u201d</p><p>Dan puffed\nout his cheeks, feigning huffiness. Phil knew\u00a0<i>exactly\u00a0</i>what\nthis was about, and they were both aware of that. \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot,\u201d he said,\npouting.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but\nI\u2019m\u00a0<i>your\u00a0</i>idiot.\u201d</p><p>Dan looked\nat him, eyes full of fondness and adoration and love. \u201cExactly.\u201d</p>",

His decision to specialize in modern\npiano music got frowned upon not only by his parents but also by his Uni, so\nhis curses were not nicely fit together anymore. He had a lot of free time in\nbetween, but his time gaps were too short to get back to his dorm, so he mostly\nstayed on campus, spending his free time in one of the multiple coffee shops\naround or with his friend Louise, who was assigned a dorm room much closer to\ncampus than he was.</p><p>That\u2019s how\nhe caught wind of it first.</p><p>He had\nalways been good at playing the piano, the time at uni had only helped with\nthat, obviously; but that he was supposedly the best in his studies had always\nsounded like an exaggeration. There were a lot of piano students, so he had\ntried toning down the people talking about him, directing them to someone else.\nAside from his musical ability there wasn\u2019t much interesting about him, though,\nso he had drifted out of the other students\u2019 eyes - at least aside from the\ntalk about whoever was supposed to be dating this week. His open bisexuality\nmade for a large pool of possible suitors, but there were students much more\ninteresting to talk about.</p><p>Now,\nthough, he was back inside of the rumor mill, and right in the center.</p><p>It started\noff innocently enough.</p><p>\u201cThe\ninstruments students are doing trios this year, did you hear?\u201d The two girls in\nthe booth right next to his were chatting animatedly with each other, obviously\nunaware of him just sitting half a meter away. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m so excited! We\nhaven\u2019t seen Dan Howell performing for a while, which is a shame. Him at a\nPiano is enough to get me going to be honest.\u201d</p><p>Dan was\nalready puffing out his chest like a peacock, debating on whether to go over\nthere or at least make his presence known otherwise, when the other girl\u2019s\nreply made him halt in his tracks. \u201cI mean\u00a0<i>same\u00a0</i>, but have you\nseen Phil Lester lately? He got rid of his emo fringe and stuff. He\u2019s\nscolding\u00a0<i>hot\u00a0</i>.\u201d She layed extra emphasis on the word hot and\nin Dan\u2019s head, two mindsets started battling over what to do. The first one\nexpressed some kind of jealousy in a \u201cI wanted to tap that girl\u201d-kind of way,\nthe other one wanted to spring onto facebook to check out the guy they were\ntalking about, whose name sounded kind of familiar.</p><p>Former emo\nfringe musician that got hot? Sign him the fuck up.</p><p>Chuckling\nlowly about his screaming bisexuality he continued listening, his interest now\npeaked.</p><p>\u201cWell,\nthey\u2019re doing trios right? Just imagine both of them on stage together\u2026\u201d</p><p>The other\ngirl actually moaned at the thought and Dan couldn\u2019t contain the smirk creeping\non his face. He took a sip from his coffee, his still open laptop on the table\nin front of him long forgotten. He probably should be working on one of his\nassignments due this week, but the girls\u2019 conversation was too interesting to\nignore.</p><p>Dan had to\nsuppress some swearing when his laptop dinged with an incoming email. He could\nhear the girls whispering behind him when they looked over because of the\nsound, realizing who he was - \u201cOh my god is that Dan Howell?\u201d and \u201cOh my god,\ndo you think he heard us?\u201d - \u00a0and he quickly leaned forward to appear busy.</p><p>The email\ncausing the \u2018ding\u2019 was actually about the assignment the girls had just been\ntalking about. He packed up his stuff immediately when he had read through it.\nThe list of assigned groups had just been hung out in front of his professor\u2019s\noffice and she invited all participants to a meeting in about half an hour on\nthe other side of the campus, so he had to rush.</p><p>~~~</p><p>Even the\nrushing didn\u2019t help in the end, the unfortunate incident of a broken down bus\ncosted him the time to check the list before the meeting started. When he got\nthere he still had no idea who his partners were, so he didn\u2019t understand the\nreason behind the quiet whispers that started when he set foot into the lecture\nhall. He managed to find his friend Louise quite fast and slid into the free\nspot next to her. \u201cWhat\u2019s the fuss about?\u201d he asked her quietly but before she\ncould answer, the door opened again and a group of professors walked in.</p><p>Their looks\nvaried about as much as those of the students sitting in the audience, making\nfor a quite colourful group. For this assignment, nearly all rock-centered\ncurses were thrown together, not only piano but also guitar, drums, bass,\nviolin and multiple other instruments. The hall was packed full, but the\narrival of the professors assured silence among the students.</p><p>\u201cGood\nmorning everyone! Hopefully you all checked the list and are in the process of\ncontacting your partners. Teamwork is the key for this assignment! Because of\nthe number of students most groups consist of one piano student, one guitar\nstudent and one of another instrument, specifically arranged to play into your\nstrengths and make you work on your weaknesses.\u201d The young male professor\u2019s\nvoice rung soundly through the hall and Dan couldn\u2019t help but raise an eyebrow.\nProf. Smith, responsible for the guitar department and \u00a0specialized on\nrock music, was so completely different from his own professor and so clich\u00e9\nrock musician that it offended Dan\u2019s believes; he fit the stereotype perfectly,\nincluding tattoo covered arms, piercings and wild, green hair, often sporting\nband shirts.</p><p>Prof.\nJohnson, on the other hand, was nothing like her profession. She was a\nmiddle-aged woman with slim, neon green glasses and grey eyes that always\nseemed to shine with mischief. Her jet black hair fell in untamable curls onto\nher shoulders and she seemed to never leave the house without a nerdy T-Shirt,\nmerch for some comic, TV-Show or movie. When she stepped forward, the whispers\naround the hall got louder and the grin on her face was so wide Dan couldn\u2019t\nhelp but grin back. He liked his Professor, even if she tended to overstep her\nboundaries and was eager to make friends among the students.</p><p>\u201cIf you\nhave questions you can always turn to me or Mr. Smith, Mr. Miller or Mrs.\nAdams, or any of the other Professors involved,\u201d she said, then paused for a\nsecond to let the murmures and voices ring out.</p><p>\u201cNow, we\nknow this is a big thing among the student body, but we hope you can keep it as\nlow as possible. Drama and relations, as fun as they are to watch for us, will\nonly make your work harder. If you want to outplay this though, be assured I\nwill be watching with a glass of wine and popcorn.\u201d There were chuckles among\nthe group and Louise next to him went red trying to keep in her laughter. Dan\ngrinned at her and made a mental note to tell her about the girls he had\nencountered before coming here.</p><p><br>\nIt took some time for the students to calm down, but when she continued\nspeaking, Dan was shocked into silence. \u201cThat also goes for other students\naside from yourself. The list is out for half an hour and the only duo\ninvolving Mr. Howell and Mr. Lester has already caused an uproar throughout the\nwhole university, so please think about what you are causing when you speak\nabout information like this next time.\u201d</p><p>The rest of\nthe meeting went by in a blur. The professors informed them of the nature of\nthe assignment - the whole thing had pretty much the built-up of a generic\ntalent show. They had to cover one song each week in an open, on-campus concert\nstarting in two weeks. Each week two groups would be voted out by the\nprofessors until three groups remained for the finale.</p><p>At the end\nDan didn\u2019t remember anything the professors had explained to them. He would beg\nLouise for her notes tomorrow, but that wasn\u2019t the important thing right now.</p><p>The\nimportant thing was that he was supposed to perform with the one and only Phil\nLester - and after a quick facebook check he realized why the name had sounded\nso familiar. Dan had had a crush on the cute and amazingly talented guitar\nplayer performing every saturday in a close-by coffee shop for weeks until he\nhad disappeared. What made it even harder for Dan was the fact that the girls\nhad been right.</p><p>The guy had\ngotten\u00a0<i>hot as fuck</i>.</p><p>Louise\u2019\nmumbled\u00a0<i>keep it in your pants\u00a0</i>seemed almost impossible to\nstick to.</p><p>~~~~</p><p>It took Dan\naround half a week to stop running from Phil. He kept himself busy with papers\nnot due for at least a few more weeks and working harder for other assignments\nthan he ever had before - he did anything that would make him forget about the\nshort message from Phil awaiting him on whatsapp, where he introduced himself\nand informed him they were partners. The little dog emoji at the end of the\nmessage made him squeal like a schoolgirl, but that was exactly the problem. He\nhad to keep it professional. Which would be difficult considering the increasingly\nhot pictures Phil posted on his facebook and instagram\u2026</p><p>On thursday\nDan finally realized he wouldn\u2019t be able to hide from this forever, as he\ncouldn\u2019t afford to fail this class. So he decided to suck it up and went with a\ngeneric confirmation and the question to set a time for their first rehearsal\nas a reply.</p><p>On friday\nDan was about as nervous as he could be. Fidgeting the entire morning, he\nchanged his outfit for at least five times until Louise threatened to rip his\nwhole wardrobe to shreds if he didn\u2019t decide soon. Her teasing didn\u2019t make his\njob any easier though. He was supposed to meet Phil in less than half an hour\nin one of the practice rooms in the music building half a campus away and he\nwas dying a little.</p><p>\u201cDo you\nreally think I look okay?\u201d he asked Louise, who was seated directly next to him\non the bus, anxiously running his fingers through his brown locks. Louise\ncaught his wrist mid-movement and forced his hand back into his lap before she\npatted it sympathetically. \u201cYou look great, Dan. Just don\u2019t behave like the\nlittle schoolgirl you\u2019re portraying right now, okay?\u201d</p><p>Dan\ncouldn\u2019t get rid of the blush creeping onto his cheeks for the rest of the bus\nride.</p><p>When he\narrived at their booked practice room, Phil wasn\u2019t there yet. Sighing in\nrelief, he let his backpack sink to the floor before moving over to the piano,\nsituated on a little pedestal in front of the window. He took a seat on the\nstool right in front of it and let his fingers run over the keys testingly. A\nseries of notes rang through the air and he realized delightedly that the piano\nwas pitched precisely.</p><p>He let his\nfingers push the keys purposefully and before he knew it they strung together\nto one of his favorite songs. He started singing along, just for the fun of it;\nbut he got completely lost in the music. At one point a second voice joined in,\nharmonizing with him to an unbelievable extend, but he didn\u2019t even realize; it\njust sounded like it had been there from the start.</p><p>Like it\nbelonged there, ringing alongside his own.</p><p>Only at the\nend of the song he realized what had happened. When the last note rang loud\nthrough the now deafening silence he whipped around, eyes wide - and met the\nbluest eyes he had ever seen.</p><p>He wanted\nto avert his eyes, wanted to check who it was, but he couldn\u2019t; for a few\nmoments, he was frozen, lost in time, no connection to reality except for the\nblue he was drowning in.</p><p>The moment\nshattered like glass around him when some kind of crashing noise pierced in\nfrom outside of the room and Dan was finally able to move his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThat was\nbeautiful,\u201d a deep, melodic voice said and he couldn\u2019t help but stare at the\nblack haired figure standing proudly and tall at the other end of the piano,\nsmiling at him reassuringly.</p><p>Dan had to\nblink a few times and pinch himself covertly, but the picture in front of him\nstayed the same: Phil Lester, in all his delicious glory, eyes shining so\nbright Dan was sure he\u2019d need sunglasses.</p><p>\u201cIt was,\u201d\nhe agreed with a raspy voice, watching wordlessly as Phil made his way over to\nhim. \u201cI\u2019m Phil,\u201d he said, sticking out his hand in front of him and Dan had to\ngulp down his fast rising excitement.\u00a0<i>I\u2019ll get to touch Phil Lester!!</i></p><p>When it happened,\nwhen their hands touched, he almost flinched back. A warm feeling shot up his\narm at top speed and for a second, he forgot how to breathe.\u00a0<i>Holy shit.</i></p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d he\nrasped back, staring up at Phil with wide eyes, not really sure what to do with\nhimself, only one thought ringing through his mind - if touching Phil felt\nlike\u00a0<i>that\u00a0</i>, how amazing would kissing him be?</p><p>Obviously,\nthe black haired guitar player was not as shocked as Dan. \u201cSo, do you think we\nfound our song for the first show?\u201d</p><p>Just like\nthat they slipped over into work - and working with Phil, Dan learned, was just\nas easy as breathing.</p><p>~~~</p><p>The first\nweek with Phil was like walking on clouds. The numerous holes in Dan\u2019s schedule\nmade for good practice times, and the fact that Phil didn\u2019t have many classes\nthis semester meant that he was there for almost every one of them. Work flowed\neasily and smoothly and on monday they were already done segmenting the song\nand deciding who would get to sing which parts.</p><p>But not\nonly the work went great, even their voices harmonized like they were meant to\nbe heard together. They didn\u2019t even need transitions between Dan\u2019s singing\nparts to Phil\u2019s, the changes from line to line went just as smoothly as the\nones with longer instrumental intervals between.</p><p>Tuesday\nevening they were basically ready to perform. Dan had his piano playing\nrecorded as a playback to make him more flexible on stage instead of immobile\nbehind a giant instrument. Phil\u2019s guitar skills maybe didn\u2019t quite match Jimmy\nHendrik\u2019s yet, but they were definitely up there, and he had the song down to a\nT. Neither of them had classes the next morning, so as they were leaving the\npractice room, Dan felt quite courageous from all the adrenaline still rushing\nthrough him after a perfect run - and he boldly asked Phil if he wanted to get\na coffee somewhere before retiring to their respective dorms.</p><p>Ten minutes\nlater they were sat in a coffee shop right off campus. Dan chose a cozy little\nbooth in the corner directly next to the window front while Phil went to get\ntheir coffees. When Dan took the first sip of his drink he almost spat it right\nback out, but instead moved to first eye the drink and then Phil suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cHow do you\nknow?\u201d he asked, his voice almost high pitched as he narrowed his eyes.</p><p><br>\nPhil just raised an eyebrow into an almost perfectly shaped curve, looking at\nDan questionably as he calmly took a sip of his coffee, not saying a word.</p><p>\u201cHow do you\nknow my order?\u201d Dan specified and watched incredulously as Phil\u2019s full,\u00a0<i>kissable\u00a0</i>lips\nspread into a wide grin. He could almost picture it, attaching his own lips\nonto his as they spread into the exact grin before the kisses started to get\nmore serious, more heated, Phil\u2019s fringe messed up, his cheeks red as clothes\nwere coming off\u2026</p><p><i>Oh my\ngod, stop betraying me, goddamn heart.</i></p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t.\nI just ordered two of my usual order.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s\nvoice ripped him out of his daydream and for a second he couldn\u2019t do much else\nthan stare in stunned silence. \u201cYou drink caramel Macchiato, too?\u201d he asked,\nblinking. Huh. He really hadn\u2019t expected that from a guy as\u00a0<i>hot\u00a0</i>as\nhim\u2026</p><p><i>Jesus\nfucking christ, actually shut the fuck up!</i></p><p>Dan\u2019s\nattraction to Phil had risen to an unhealthy level by now. Not only was he hot\nas fuck, no; during their practice time Dan also had had to learn that the guy\nwas smart, funny, lively, and talented as\u00a0<i>fuck\u00a0</i>, even more than\nDan remembered him to be. Dan was lucky the assignment, and working on the\nmusic kept him busy and focused, or else he would have probably jumped the guy\nby now.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my\nall time favorite,\u201d Phil confirmed, his grin transforming into a cheeky smile, and\nDan couldn\u2019t keep a blush from dusting his cheeks pink.</p><p>\u201cMine too,\u201d\nhe admitted and took another tentative sip from his drink, purposefully\navoiding Phil\u2019s eyes. He knew that if he looked into them now, he would\u00a0<i>drown\u00a0</i>in\nthem.</p><p>For a few\nmoments it was silent between them, both nursing their coffee, Dan deeply lost\nin thought about the blueness of Phil\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cSo, Muse,\nhuh?\u201d</p><p>It was Phil\nbreaking the silence and Dan looked up, surprised. It took him a second to\nrealize how Phil had even known he liked\u00a0<i>Muse\u00a0</i>, until he\nrealized they had met while singing their song\u00a0<i>Thought Contagion\u00a0</i>before\nchoosing it for their first performance. This time he was pretty sure he kept\nthe blush at bay.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\nlove them.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s\nmouth stretched into a happy smile, his eyes shining brightly, full of honest\nexcitement as he started chattering about them. Dan had to gulp and pinch his\nhand unsuspiciously to keep himself from losing his\u00a0<i>mind\u00a0</i>.</p><p>They moved\nfrom\u00a0<i>Muse\u00a0</i>to\u00a0<i>Panic!\u00a0</i>to\u00a0<i>Fallout\nBoy\u00a0</i>to\u00a0<i>Paramore\u00a0</i>and even further. Albums became\nscores, which lead the way to games, movies and TV shows. It was almost scary\nhow much they had in common, how much their interests overlapped, and it\nactually took Dan a while to remember a question he\u2019d had since he\u2019d heard of\nthe assigned groups.</p><p>He used a\ntemporary lull in conversation - one that he could have easily filled with\nsomething relatable to the topic they were on, mind you - to finally ask.</p><p>\u201cBy the\nway, do you know why we are the only duo?\u201d</p><p>Phil raised\nhis eyebrow, a cheeky smile back on his face and Dan knew there was a blush\ncreeping up his cheeks yet again. He couldn\u2019t help but feel like he missed\nsomething vital here, but he had no idea what exactly.</p><p>\u201cDid you\nnot pay attention at the meeting?\u201d</p><p>Dan felt\nhis eyes widen in surprise and blinked, cheeks even hotter than before. \u201cI\nmight have been\u2026\u00a0<i>preoccupied\u00a0</i>,\u201d he admitted and Phil\u2019s smile\ngrew into a full-blown grin.</p><p>\u201cProf.\nJohnson and Prof. Smith spent like ten minutes explaining,\u201d he informed Dan,\n\u201cApparently the numbers didn\u2019t match up and they had to have one duo, so they\nboth chose their best student and realized we would be a good\u00a0<i>match</i>.\u201d\nHe put special emphasis on the word\u00a0<i>match</i>\u00a0and for a second,\nDan wasn\u2019t sure if he would be able to stay conscious. Was he just making a\njoke\u2026 Or was Phil Lester\u00a0<i>really</i>\u00a0<i>flirting</i>\u00a0with him?</p><p>\u201cWe - we\nare,\u201d he stammered in response and Phil\u2019s chuckling send his heart into\noverdrive. Oh god. How was he supposed to survive at least 2 more months\nworking with the guy?</p><p>\u201cI think so\ntoo,\u201d Phil whispered back with a husky voice, making Dan choke on his long cold\ncoffee.</p><p><i>Fuck,\nthese next weeks are going to be torture.</i></p><p>~~~</p><p>The next\nmonday morning Dan found himself in yet another on-campus coffee shop, putting\nthe finishing touches on an assignment that was due today. Normally it was a\nbreak he would spend with Phil, but he had stuff to arrange with one of his\nprofessors, so they decided he would join up with Dan as soon as he was able\nto. They had managed to get a headstart on this week\u2019s performance by starting\nworking on it on saturday, so they weren\u2019t in much of a rush. They had decided\non a song and discussed divisioning on sunday already; it was only practicing left.</p><p>Of course\nthe performance on Friday had gone great. They had gotten a lot of applause by\nthe watching students, the little hall on campus used for performances had been\npacked to the rim, so there had been at least a few hundred watchers. The\nprofessors had obviously also been satisfied with their presentation,\nconsidering they had informed them they would progress into the next round even\nbefore the whole show had been over.</p><p>So Dan and\nPhil had spent their Friday night celebrating. Even though neither of them were\nreally the party going type, they had agreed to go out for a few drinks with\ntheir best friends Louise and PJ - who, coincidentally, were in the same group\n- and Tyler, a music production student Dan had been friends with for years. He\nhad flirted with Phil quite obviously and had teased Dan for his sour mood\nafterwards, but had assured him that\u00a0<i>Phil only has eyes for you, you\ndumbass, pay attention!</i>, coupled with a playful whack on his head.</p><p>The memory\nlet Dan grumble absently, but the arriving of a group of students in the booth\nright behind him ripped him away from his trip down memory lane. \u201cI mean,\nthey\u2019re both bisexual, right?\u201d one of the girls stated while taking a seat,\nmaking him peek up immediately. He liked to hear stories about his fellow\nunicorns and regretted only becoming aware of this conversation after it had\nalready started.</p><p>\u201cThey are,\u201d\na guy\u2019s voice confirmed. Dan was pretty sure he had heard the voice before, but\nhe didn\u2019t have the courage to turn around and check. He was lucky enough to not\nhave been spotted by the group, he really didn\u2019t have to push his luck.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen\ntheir sexual tension? I know you want to fuck them both, Caleb, but come on.\u201d\nThe female voice was followed by a male groan and the sound of a head meeting\nthe tabletop. \u201cI knowww,\u201d was the answer, \u201cI\u2019m sexually deprived, not\u00a0<i>blind\u00a0</i>.\u201d</p><p>Dan raked\nhis brain, trying to figure out who they were talking about. Being friends with\nLouise and Tyler meant that he was mostly up to date with recent campus gossip,\nand he really wanted to tell them about this later.</p><p>\u201cDid you\nknow there\u2019s already a bet going on? About if they\u2019ll be dating by the end of\nthis semester.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich\nidiot would even bet against that?\u201d</p><p>The booth\nerupted into laughter and Dan furrowed his eyebrows, thinking. He leaned\nforward, trying to appear busy, but in reality the assignment currently open on\nhis laptop was the furthest thing from his mind.</p><p>\u201cOkay, but\naside from all that they were the best group, even if it was just the two of\nthem. They\u2019re gonna win this thing, hands down.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes\nwent as wide as saucers as realization seeped into him. They weren\u2019t really\ntalking about -</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u00a0<i>Thought\nContagion\u00a0</i>was brilliant, I\u2019m so excited to see what they\u2019ll come up\nwith for the next round.\u201d</p><p>That was\nthe moment Phil decided to make his appearance, ripping him out of his thoughts\nalmost violently. \u201cMorning!\u201d he said, cheerfully, two cups of steaming coffee\nin his hands. He pushed one of them over to Dan after he had taken a seat.</p><p>A look of\nconfusion, even concern appeared on his face when Dan didn\u2019t react, just\ncontinued staring at his laptop screen with his eyes wide open. \u201cDan? Are you\nokay? Have you seen a ghost?\u201d</p><p>The chatter\nbehind him ended immediately. When he slowly turned around a group of seven\npeople was staring at him, wide eyed. All of them scrambled to their feets as\nfast as they could. \u201cYou\u2019re a cute couple!\u201d one of the girls squeaked out, then\nthey were gone, leaving Dan to explain the situation to Phil.</p><p>Needless to\nsay Phil wasn\u2019t fazed at all, instead he used the story to make more flirty\nremarks, making Dan blush yet again.</p><p><i>Damn,\nI\u2019m fucked.</i></p><p>~~~~</p><p><br>\nAlmost three months passed by in a rush and by december Dan couldn\u2019t even\nrecognize his life anymore. All the time he had previously spent alone in front\nof his laptop, browsing tumblr or watching Netflix, converted into Phil-time,\nslowly but surely. They played games or watched TV-Shows nearly every day after\npractice. Dan\u2019s roommate had even asked him if he was moving out with all the\ntime he spent away, but Dan couldn\u2019t help himself. Phil lived in a flat near\ncampus all alone. A tiny flat, sure, but it made for the best meetup place,\nespecially for gaming or movie nights or for research about their next song -\nand it gave them some privacy. Not that much had happened yet aside from the\nincreasingly flirty comments and occasional cuddle sessions, but it still made\ntheir friendship easier.</p><p>Especially\nbecause they were now something like campus-famous and got recognized wherever\nthey went.</p><p>So far,\nthey had aced most performances and were through to the last show before\nchristmas break. After New Year\u2019s there was only one show left before the big\nfinale. They were pretty sure they had a good grade secured, but they still\ngave it their all - they had come so far, there was no way they were giving up\nnow.</p><p>In the\nupcoming show only seven groups were left and it was the first one with two\nmandatory songs, one optional and one christmas themed, dropping the\u00a0<i>rock\u00a0</i>theme\njust for this once. Since the last week was cut short - Christmas break started\non thursday - they had an additional half week to prepare. Dan and Phil had\ndecided on\u00a0<i>Panic!\u00a0</i>\u2019s\u00a0<i>High Hopes\u00a0</i>for the first\nsong and\u00a0<i>Last Christmas\u00a0</i>for the second and as always, they had\nbeen quite fast with their work. They were practiced and basically done on\nMonday, so they allowed themselves the night off. Phil\u2019s brother was in town\nand Dan had\u00a0<i>heartlessly neglected\u00a0</i>Tyler since the assignment\nstarted (his words), basically forcing Dan to spent the night with him.</p><p>Fortunately\nTyler had a lecture early the next morning, so he wasn\u2019t trying to get himself\nor Dan trashed. He did, however, made use of the time by grilling Dan about his\nrelationship to Phil.</p><p>Dan was a\nbit annoyed, but at the end of the day he was glad to be able to talk about it,\neven if he would never admit to that. Louise and her group were still in the\nrun for the finals too, which made her so busy they barely were able to talk\nfor longer than a few minutes at a time - and he desperately needed an\noutsider\u2019s opinion.</p><p>It took him\nalmost an hour to get Tyler up to date on what had happened, all the while\ngetting interrupted by texts from Phil. Right when he was done explaining his\nphone dinged again, indicating another text.</p><p><i>\u2018the\ngirl two tables over has a cute lil pup on her lap i keep staring she probs\nthinks i\u2019m a perv help\u2019\u00a0</i>it read and he couldn\u2019t help but chuckle. Tyler inspected him warily\nfrom across the table, absently playing with the straw in his half-empty\ncocktail. \u201cOkay, who are you texting?\u201d he asked then, fixing Dan with a steely\ngaze.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s\njust Phil,\u201d he answered distractedly, typing a quick response before turning\nhis attention back to Tyler. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you\nshitting me?\u201d he asked back, a fitting expression on his face like he couldn\u2019t\nbelieve what he was hearing. Dan just answered with a surprised \u201chuh?\u201d,\nshooting him a confused look.</p><p>\u201cMate, how\ndense can you be? You are basically dating the guy, only without the good\nparts!\u201d</p><p>Dan\nblinked, completely lost now, unable to follow Tyler\u2019s train of thought.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and\nPhil are dating, Dan, wake up! The only thing missing is the sex!\u201d\u00a0<br><br>\nDan was stunned into silence, staring at Tyler like he had grown a second head.\nIt took the thought a while to register in his brain, but then he blushed,\ntaking a huge gulp of his drink before calling the waiter over to order another\none.</p><p>He needed\nmore alcohol for this.</p><p>~~~~</p><p>The show on\nwednesday evening went exceptionally well. They had the most fun rocking\nto\u00a0<i>High Hopes\u00a0</i>and got really festive during\u00a0<i>Last\nChristmas\u00a0</i>, with Dan at the Piano and Phil sat on top of it. Their\nprofessors called them over and into the next show immediately, making them\ngiddy and high on adrenaline in the process.</p><p>The\nchristmas party thrown by the rock music department started directly afterwards\nand PJ and Louise, immensely proud of their best friends even though their own\ngroup had been voted out, insisted on going. Still in an after show rush they\nagreed, but soon realized why they normally didn\u2019t like parties. It was loud,\nthe room stuffed with people and the food was average at best, and it took them\naround twenty minutes to revert back to the snacks table, where they hid from\nthe actual party.</p><p>When Louise,\nPJ and Tyler of all people found them, sporting a cheeky expression, Dan knew\nthey were fucked. They were leaning against a wall, talking and laughing with\neach other as much as the music allowed them to, and only a few people were\ninspecting them from afar.</p><p>\u201cDo you\nknow where you\u2019re standing?\u201d PJ asked when the group was within earshot and Dan\nraised an eyebrow. \u201cNext to the snacks table where we always are?\u201d he remarked\ndrily, making Phil chuckle next to him.</p><p>\u201cLook up!\u201d\nTyler singsonged with a high pitched voice and flattered his eyelashes with\nfaked innocence.</p><p>Dan perked\nup immediately. He knew that voice.</p><p>He didn\u2019t\neven need to look up to know what was fixated on the wall over their heads.</p><p>\u201cA\nMistletoe!\u201d Louise grinned so widely Dan was sure it had to hurt. He turned his\nattention to Phil, his heart throbbing in his chest on full speed.</p><p>There was a\ncheeky smile on the guitarist\u2019s face as he took a step closer, taking a hold of\nDan\u2019s head with both hands. \u201cThey want a kiss,\u201d he murmured, lowly, \u201clet\u2019s give\nthem a kiss.\u201d</p><p>The second\nhis lips met Phil\u2019s was like a firework going off everywhere inside of his\nbody. For a moment he forgot where he was, hell, even who he was, just\ncontinued kissing Phil with passion and lust and love. He didn\u2019t even hesitate\nopening up his mouth at Phil\u2019s silent request to let him in, too far gone to\ncare - hell, to even\u00a0<i>realize\u00a0</i>they had an audience.</p><p>The kiss\nlasted for minutes and it probably could have gone on much longer if there\nwouldn\u2019t have been a sudden outburst of applause. The blood took a second to\nreach Dan\u2019s brain after having rushed somewhere south only seconds ago, but\nwhen it did, it immediately spread into his cheeks. They broke apart, Dan\u2019s\nface still in Phil\u2019s hands, silently contemplating the recent event.</p><p>He had just\nkissed Phil Lester. In front of basically the whole rock music department.</p><p><i>Great.\nJust great.</i></p><p>The\napplause and whooping didn\u2019t stop soon and he couldn\u2019t do much more then to\nexchange a long look with Phil. They had a silent discussion Dan himself didn\u2019t\nknow the content of, until suddenly and with no indication there was panic on\nPhil\u2019s face as he hastily let go of Dan and scrambled to get his phone out of\nhis pocket. It was vibrating violently in his hands and Dan couldn\u2019t even blink\nby the time Phil rasped out a \u201cShit! My brother is waiting for me!\u201d and left in\na rush.</p><p>Dan stood\nthere, staring after Phil until most of the students had averted their gazes\nfrom him and went back to whatever they had been doing before. When the ice in\nhis veins freezing him into place finally dissipated, he groaned. He knew\nPhil\u2019s brother Martyn was picking him up for Christmas with their family, and\nhe wouldn\u2019t be back until january.</p><p><i>Of\ncourse. That\u2019s just my fucking luck.</i></p><p>~~~</p><p>He spent\nchristmas break in some sort of limbo, like his relationship to Phil was\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat, platonic and romantic at the same time. He knew the kiss had\nmeant something not only to him but also to Phil, that much had been obvious\nwith the way he had taken the offensive in deepening the kiss and how he had\nheld him afterwards. But that was about the amount of information Dan had, and\nneither of them mentioned the kiss on any level, so he decided to just ignore\nthe issue for now.</p><p>It did made\nhim jumpy and fidgety and mostly unable to focus, though, and only his frequent\nskype calls with Phil got him focused and concentrated enough to get some much\nneeded work done.</p><p>There were\nonly two shows left, but they were only one week apart and both required three\nsongs, so they decided to learn all songs over the break. They spent hours on\nskype, deciding on the songs and how to play and sing them, so they would be\ndone learning their personal parts until they could meet back up in person.</p><p>For a short\nmoment, their reunion was like the sun had risen again. They hugged, soft words\nof attachment and longing on their lips, but then it was like someone had\nflipped a switch and they were back in working mode. Phil didn\u2019t mention the\nkiss and Dan didn\u2019t dare to, so they went back to Status Quo, just like that.</p><p>The first\nshow in the new year went okay-ish. Neither of them poured everything into it,\nalready looking forward to the songs they had chosen for the finale, but they\nstill managed to pull through. Their only truly memorable performance was\u00a0<i>The\nBlack Parade\u00a0</i>by\u00a0<i>My Chemical Romance\u00a0</i>, which they\ndefinitely aced, but the other ones admittedly fell a bit flat. Both their\nprofessors urged them to not take it too lightly just because they had done so\namazingly until now, so they swore to give everything they had in their last\nperformances together.</p><p>They were\nthe first group performing in the finale. It wasn\u2019t hard for Dan to get in the\nmood of their songs, considering they were all pining lovesongs and he would\nhave the one he was pining after up on stage with him, so he was glad they got\nto go first. It made the waiting and anticipation in between easier, and\nwaiting for the results when they were done didn\u2019t mean much to him anyway - he\ndidn\u2019t care too much about winning.</p><p>He just\nwanted to give his best, pour all his feelings into the songs when he was up\nthere with Phil. He wanted to make it obvious that he meant every word he was\nsinging.</p><p>He wanted\nto get Phil to understand\u2026</p><p>In short,\nhe just wanted Phil.</p><p>Their first\nsong was a soft piano interpretation of\u00a0<i>It\u2019s not living (If it\u2019s not\nwith you)\u00a0</i>by\u00a0<i>The 1975\u00a0</i>, and Dan was so entranced by\nPhil he forgot to look at his hands while playing. He didn\u2019t make a single\nmistake, thankfully, \u00a0but if he would have made one he probably wouldn\u2019t\neven have noticed. He benefited from the fact that he had practiced the piano\npart so often on the tiny piano in his childhood bedroom that his parents had\nasked him to please,\u00a0<i>please\u00a0</i>stop.</p><p>They spent\ntheir break with a bottle of coke huddled together on a tiny sofa backstage,\nmaking loose conversation and trying to get their mind off of things. Dan\nbasked in the close physical proximity and simply smiled when Phil just\ncasually took his hand while he talked, playing with his fingers. He had a\nfeeling that things would be going well.</p><p>Dan had\nparticularly fun during their next song.\u00a0<i>The Last Of The Real\nOnes\u00a0</i>by\u00a0<i>Fallout Boy\u00a0</i>was one of his favorite songs and\nhe connected a lot of the lyrics to Phil. The piano playing was not an issue\nthis time since they had both laid down their playing previously and conjoined\nit in a track, so he had all the time in the world to focus on Phil, which he\ntook full advantage of. They riled up the crowd so much that Tyler, who had agreed\nto be the presenter of the night, had trouble getting them back in check for\nthe next group.</p><p>During\nchristmas break, far away from Phil and his feelings, their next song had\nseemed like a good idea. It was romantic, emotional and full of love and Dan\ncouldn\u2019t think of any other song that would make his feelings for Phil more\nclear than this.</p><p>Now,\nthough, it seemed entirely too personal to perform in front of what felt like\nthe whole Uni. During practice he had refrained from building too much of a\nconnection, afraid of taking it too far, but now he didn\u2019t have much of a\nchoice and it made him more nervous than any other performance before. His\nhands were sweaty, his stomach was rumbling and he was ready to cancel the\nwhole thing when Phil noticed the state he was in.</p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d he\nwhispered, pointedly ignoring the other people lounging around backstage,\ncompletely focusing on Dan, \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay.\u00a0<i>You\u00a0</i>will be okay.\nAnd I will be with you, right there by your side the whole time, okay?\u201d</p><p>It was in\nthis moment that something settled in Dan\u2019s chest. He returned Phil\u2019s fond look\nwith courage and determination, grasping his hand in his and squeezing it\ntightly. \u201cMe too. We\u2019re on the same page.\u201d</p><p>He was sure\nPhil caught the double meaning when his look got soft. \u201cI think I always knew,\u201d\nhe answered quietly, almost inaudible. \u201cLet\u2019s do this.\u201d</p><p>~~~</p><p>Their last\nperformance of this assignment was a complete success. They performed\u00a0<i>The\nOnly Exception\u00a0</i>by\u00a0<i>Paramore\u00a0</i>sitting huddled together\non the little Piano stool in front of the huge piano and didn\u2019t take their eyes\noff of each other the entire time. It was so emotional Tyler had tears in his\neyes when he came on stage, hugging first Phil, then Dan tightly, muttering a\nsoft \u201cgo get \u2018em, tiger\u201d into Dan\u2019s ear and Dan could feel his heart swelling.</p><p>This was\nit.</p><p>Backstage,\nthankfully, they were alone. Both of the other groups were nowhere to be seen,\nand Phil obviously noticed faster than him.</p><p>Before he\neven had the chance to turn around from closing the door he was already spun\naround and pressed against the next hard surface, Phil\u2019s lips attacking his\nown.</p><p>For what\nfelt like ages they were kissing furiously, like they had deprived themselves\nof this for far too long and now a dam had been broken down, nothing holding\nthem back anymore.</p><p>Once they\nwere out of breath Phil separated their lips, lovingly gazing into his eyes\ninstead. \u201cI have waited for this for far too long,\u201d he whispered quietly,\nsoftly, his hands on the sides of Dan\u2019s head, his thumbs gently caressing his\ncheeks.</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d\nhe mumbled back, drowning in Phil\u2019s eyes and feeling himself falling, falling;\nfalling even deeper in love with him. \u201cI meant every word I sang.\u201d</p><p>There was a\nbeat of quiet, then:</p><p>\u201cI love\nyou.\u201d</p><p>The words\nwere muttered completely simultaneously, and for the single bat of an eye both\nstared at the other, stunned into silence.</p><p>Then they\nwere both dissolving into giggles, holding onto the other to keep from toppling\nover.</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d\nPhil gasped out, \u201cwas so us.\u201d</p><p>Dan\ncouldn\u2019t help but agree.</p><p>~~~</p><p>\u201cDo you\nreally think so, Badiha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\nknow, Henry, but they did seem smitten during that song, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue!\u201d</p><p>There was a\ngroup of at least five people seated in the booth directly behind Dan\u2019s and\neven though he wasn\u2019t that much of a gossip he couldn\u2019t help but eavesdrop. He\nwas busily procrastinating the work he needed to do until the next day,\nrefreshing tumblr around ten times a minute, so it wasn\u2019t too surprising the\nconversation distracted him as soon as it got loud enough for him to hear.</p><p>\u201cBut they\nhaven\u2019t been seen in public with each other in ages aside from their\nperformances. I just really want them to be happy with each other, is that too\nmuch to ask?\u201d</p><p>That was\nthe first voice again. Dan allowed himself a short look at the group out of the\ncorner of his eyes and recognized all faces he was able to pick up on. They had\nall been to the performance Phil and him did twice a week in a near bar ever\nsince their joint assignment last year, he was sure of it. He mostly recognized\nthem because of the person that had spoken first, a girl with the pride flag\ndrawn on her eyelids. He remembered how she had attracted his attention during\ntheir first show because of her truly iconic makeup.</p><p>\u201cI know,\nright?!\u201d a male voice joined in and this time Dan didn\u2019t need the information\npractically jumping into his face to realize they were talking about him and\nPhil.</p><p>After their\nwin in the finale they had decided to keep their relationship at a down low,\ntrying to make themselves comfortable with being boyfriends before they truly\nmade it public. They were still pretty famous throughout the students and the\ncenter of the rumor mill, but they had been in a relationship for almost a year\nnow and had only recently realized there was nothing to be afraid of if\neverybody knew. Most of them would be happy for them, and the rest of them,\nwell -</p><p>They\u2019d just\nhave to suck it up.</p><p>That was\nthe moment his boyfriend decided to show up. He slid into the booth, taking a\nseat directly next to Dan, pressing their thighs together. \u201cMorning, love,\u201d he\ngreeted Dan gently, planting a kiss on his cheek before grinning happily. \u201cBusy\nprocrastinating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dan\nreplied extra loud, grinning right back, \u201cbut I\u2019d rather kiss my boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>So they\nshared a short, cute kiss, making the group behind them gasp loudly. \u201cIt\u2019s\nthem,\u201d the girl with the pride flag on her eyelids whispered into the silence\nstretching between them. Dan grinned.</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d he\nconfirmed cheekily, turning around to look at her. \u201cVery iconic Make-up by the\nway, I like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god,\nthank you,\u201d she answered, a blush becoming apparent on her cheeks and Dan\u2019s\ngrin only got wider before he turned his attention back around to Phil.</p><p>\u201cWhat was\nthat about?\u201d he asked with a raised eyebrow and his head cutely tilted to the\nside.</p><p>Dan pecked\nhim on the lips. \u201cHad to make a point.\u201d</p><p>Phil looked\nback cheekily, a grin on his face so wide Dan was able to see his tongue poking\nout between his teeth. \u201cA point about what?\u201d</p><p>Dan puffed\nout his cheeks, feigning huffiness. Phil knew\u00a0<i>exactly\u00a0</i>what\nthis was about, and they were both aware of that. \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot,\u201d he said,\npouting.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but\nI\u2019m\u00a0<i>your\u00a0</i>idiot.\u201d</p><p>Dan looked\nat him, eyes full of fondness and adoration and love. \u201cExactly.\u201d</p>",

His decision to specialize in modern\npiano music got frowned upon not only by his parents but also by his Uni, so\nhis curses were not nicely fit together anymore. He had a lot of free time in\nbetween, but his time gaps were too short to get back to his dorm, so he mostly\nstayed on campus, spending his free time in one of the multiple coffee shops\naround or with his friend Louise, who was assigned a dorm room much closer to\ncampus than he was.</p><p>That\u2019s how\nhe caught wind of it first.</p><p>He had\nalways been good at playing the piano, the time at uni had only helped with\nthat, obviously; but that he was supposedly the best in his studies had always\nsounded like an exaggeration. There were a lot of piano students, so he had\ntried toning down the people talking about him, directing them to someone else.\nAside from his musical ability there wasn\u2019t much interesting about him, though,\nso he had drifted out of the other students\u2019 eyes - at least aside from the\ntalk about whoever was supposed to be dating this week. His open bisexuality\nmade for a large pool of possible suitors, but there were students much more\ninteresting to talk about.</p><p>Now,\nthough, he was back inside of the rumor mill, and right in the center.</p><p>It started\noff innocently enough.</p><p>\u201cThe\ninstruments students are doing trios this year, did you hear?\u201d The two girls in\nthe booth right next to his were chatting animatedly with each other, obviously\nunaware of him just sitting half a meter away. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m so excited! We\nhaven\u2019t seen Dan Howell performing for a while, which is a shame. Him at a\nPiano is enough to get me going to be honest.\u201d</p><p>Dan was\nalready puffing out his chest like a peacock, debating on whether to go over\nthere or at least make his presence known otherwise, when the other girl\u2019s\nreply made him halt in his tracks. \u201cI mean\u00a0<i>same\u00a0</i>, but have you\nseen Phil Lester lately? He got rid of his emo fringe and stuff. He\u2019s\nscolding\u00a0<i>hot\u00a0</i>.\u201d She layed extra emphasis on the word hot and\nin Dan\u2019s head, two mindsets started battling over what to do. The first one\nexpressed some kind of jealousy in a \u201cI wanted to tap that girl\u201d-kind of way,\nthe other one wanted to spring onto facebook to check out the guy they were\ntalking about, whose name sounded kind of familiar.</p><p>Former emo\nfringe musician that got hot? Sign him the fuck up.</p><p>Chuckling\nlowly about his screaming bisexuality he continued listening, his interest now\npeaked.</p><p>\u201cWell,\nthey\u2019re doing trios right? Just imagine both of them on stage together\u2026\u201d</p><p>The other\ngirl actually moaned at the thought and Dan couldn\u2019t contain the smirk creeping\non his face. He took a sip from his coffee, his still open laptop on the table\nin front of him long forgotten. He probably should be working on one of his\nassignments due this week, but the girls\u2019 conversation was too interesting to\nignore.</p><p>Dan had to\nsuppress some swearing when his laptop dinged with an incoming email. He could\nhear the girls whispering behind him when they looked over because of the\nsound, realizing who he was - \u201cOh my god is that Dan Howell?\u201d and \u201cOh my god,\ndo you think he heard us?\u201d - \u00a0and he quickly leaned forward to appear busy.</p><p>The email\ncausing the \u2018ding\u2019 was actually about the assignment the girls had just been\ntalking about. He packed up his stuff immediately when he had read through it.\nThe list of assigned groups had just been hung out in front of his professor\u2019s\noffice and she invited all participants to a meeting in about half an hour on\nthe other side of the campus, so he had to rush.</p><p>~~~</p><p>Even the\nrushing didn\u2019t help in the end, the unfortunate incident of a broken down bus\ncosted him the time to check the list before the meeting started. When he got\nthere he still had no idea who his partners were, so he didn\u2019t understand the\nreason behind the quiet whispers that started when he set foot into the lecture\nhall. He managed to find his friend Louise quite fast and slid into the free\nspot next to her. \u201cWhat\u2019s the fuss about?\u201d he asked her quietly but before she\ncould answer, the door opened again and a group of professors walked in.</p><p>Their looks\nvaried about as much as those of the students sitting in the audience, making\nfor a quite colourful group. For this assignment, nearly all rock-centered\ncurses were thrown together, not only piano but also guitar, drums, bass,\nviolin and multiple other instruments. The hall was packed full, but the\narrival of the professors assured silence among the students.</p><p>\u201cGood\nmorning everyone! Hopefully you all checked the list and are in the process of\ncontacting your partners. Teamwork is the key for this assignment! Because of\nthe number of students most groups consist of one piano student, one guitar\nstudent and one of another instrument, specifically arranged to play into your\nstrengths and make you work on your weaknesses.\u201d The young male professor\u2019s\nvoice rung soundly through the hall and Dan couldn\u2019t help but raise an eyebrow.\nProf. Smith, responsible for the guitar department and \u00a0specialized on\nrock music, was so completely different from his own professor and so clich\u00e9\nrock musician that it offended Dan\u2019s believes; he fit the stereotype perfectly,\nincluding tattoo covered arms, piercings and wild, green hair, often sporting\nband shirts.</p><p>Prof.\nJohnson, on the other hand, was nothing like her profession. She was a\nmiddle-aged woman with slim, neon green glasses and grey eyes that always\nseemed to shine with mischief. Her jet black hair fell in untamable curls onto\nher shoulders and she seemed to never leave the house without a nerdy T-Shirt,\nmerch for some comic, TV-Show or movie. When she stepped forward, the whispers\naround the hall got louder and the grin on her face was so wide Dan couldn\u2019t\nhelp but grin back. He liked his Professor, even if she tended to overstep her\nboundaries and was eager to make friends among the students.</p><p>\u201cIf you\nhave questions you can always turn to me or Mr. Smith, Mr. Miller or Mrs.\nAdams, or any of the other Professors involved,\u201d she said, then paused for a\nsecond to let the murmures and voices ring out.</p><p>\u201cNow, we\nknow this is a big thing among the student body, but we hope you can keep it as\nlow as possible. Drama and relations, as fun as they are to watch for us, will\nonly make your work harder. If you want to outplay this though, be assured I\nwill be watching with a glass of wine and popcorn.\u201d There were chuckles among\nthe group and Louise next to him went red trying to keep in her laughter. Dan\ngrinned at her and made a mental note to tell her about the girls he had\nencountered before coming here.</p><p><br>\nIt took some time for the students to calm down, but when she continued\nspeaking, Dan was shocked into silence. \u201cThat also goes for other students\naside from yourself. The list is out for half an hour and the only duo\ninvolving Mr. Howell and Mr. Lester has already caused an uproar throughout the\nwhole university, so please think about what you are causing when you speak\nabout information like this next time.\u201d</p><p>The rest of\nthe meeting went by in a blur. The professors informed them of the nature of\nthe assignment - the whole thing had pretty much the built-up of a generic\ntalent show. They had to cover one song each week in an open, on-campus concert\nstarting in two weeks. Each week two groups would be voted out by the\nprofessors until three groups remained for the finale.</p><p>At the end\nDan didn\u2019t remember anything the professors had explained to them. He would beg\nLouise for her notes tomorrow, but that wasn\u2019t the important thing right now.</p><p>The\nimportant thing was that he was supposed to perform with the one and only Phil\nLester - and after a quick facebook check he realized why the name had sounded\nso familiar. Dan had had a crush on the cute and amazingly talented guitar\nplayer performing every saturday in a close-by coffee shop for weeks until he\nhad disappeared. What made it even harder for Dan was the fact that the girls\nhad been right.</p><p>The guy had\ngotten\u00a0<i>hot as fuck</i>.</p><p>Louise\u2019\nmumbled\u00a0<i>keep it in your pants\u00a0</i>seemed almost impossible to\nstick to.</p><p>~~~~</p><p>It took Dan\naround half a week to stop running from Phil. He kept himself busy with papers\nnot due for at least a few more weeks and working harder for other assignments\nthan he ever had before - he did anything that would make him forget about the\nshort message from Phil awaiting him on whatsapp, where he introduced himself\nand informed him they were partners. The little dog emoji at the end of the\nmessage made him squeal like a schoolgirl, but that was exactly the problem. He\nhad to keep it professional. Which would be difficult considering the increasingly\nhot pictures Phil posted on his facebook and instagram\u2026</p><p>On thursday\nDan finally realized he wouldn\u2019t be able to hide from this forever, as he\ncouldn\u2019t afford to fail this class. So he decided to suck it up and went with a\ngeneric confirmation and the question to set a time for their first rehearsal\nas a reply.</p><p>On friday\nDan was about as nervous as he could be. Fidgeting the entire morning, he\nchanged his outfit for at least five times until Louise threatened to rip his\nwhole wardrobe to shreds if he didn\u2019t decide soon. Her teasing didn\u2019t make his\njob any easier though. He was supposed to meet Phil in less than half an hour\nin one of the practice rooms in the music building half a campus away and he\nwas dying a little.</p><p>\u201cDo you\nreally think I look okay?\u201d he asked Louise, who was seated directly next to him\non the bus, anxiously running his fingers through his brown locks. Louise\ncaught his wrist mid-movement and forced his hand back into his lap before she\npatted it sympathetically. \u201cYou look great, Dan. Just don\u2019t behave like the\nlittle schoolgirl you\u2019re portraying right now, okay?\u201d</p><p>Dan\ncouldn\u2019t get rid of the blush creeping onto his cheeks for the rest of the bus\nride.</p><p>When he\narrived at their booked practice room, Phil wasn\u2019t there yet. Sighing in\nrelief, he let his backpack sink to the floor before moving over to the piano,\nsituated on a little pedestal in front of the window. He took a seat on the\nstool right in front of it and let his fingers run over the keys testingly. A\nseries of notes rang through the air and he realized delightedly that the piano\nwas pitched precisely.</p><p>He let his\nfingers push the keys purposefully and before he knew it they strung together\nto one of his favorite songs. He started singing along, just for the fun of it;\nbut he got completely lost in the music. At one point a second voice joined in,\nharmonizing with him to an unbelievable extend, but he didn\u2019t even realize; it\njust sounded like it had been there from the start.</p><p>Like it\nbelonged there, ringing alongside his own.</p><p>Only at the\nend of the song he realized what had happened. When the last note rang loud\nthrough the now deafening silence he whipped around, eyes wide - and met the\nbluest eyes he had ever seen.</p><p>He wanted\nto avert his eyes, wanted to check who it was, but he couldn\u2019t; for a few\nmoments, he was frozen, lost in time, no connection to reality except for the\nblue he was drowning in.</p><p>The moment\nshattered like glass around him when some kind of crashing noise pierced in\nfrom outside of the room and Dan was finally able to move his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThat was\nbeautiful,\u201d a deep, melodic voice said and he couldn\u2019t help but stare at the\nblack haired figure standing proudly and tall at the other end of the piano,\nsmiling at him reassuringly.</p><p>Dan had to\nblink a few times and pinch himself covertly, but the picture in front of him\nstayed the same: Phil Lester, in all his delicious glory, eyes shining so\nbright Dan was sure he\u2019d need sunglasses.</p><p>\u201cIt was,\u201d\nhe agreed with a raspy voice, watching wordlessly as Phil made his way over to\nhim. \u201cI\u2019m Phil,\u201d he said, sticking out his hand in front of him and Dan had to\ngulp down his fast rising excitement.\u00a0<i>I\u2019ll get to touch Phil Lester!!</i></p><p>When it happened,\nwhen their hands touched, he almost flinched back. A warm feeling shot up his\narm at top speed and for a second, he forgot how to breathe.\u00a0<i>Holy shit.</i></p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d he\nrasped back, staring up at Phil with wide eyes, not really sure what to do with\nhimself, only one thought ringing through his mind - if touching Phil felt\nlike\u00a0<i>that\u00a0</i>, how amazing would kissing him be?</p><p>Obviously,\nthe black haired guitar player was not as shocked as Dan. \u201cSo, do you think we\nfound our song for the first show?\u201d</p><p>Just like\nthat they slipped over into work - and working with Phil, Dan learned, was just\nas easy as breathing.</p><p>~~~</p><p>The first\nweek with Phil was like walking on clouds. The numerous holes in Dan\u2019s schedule\nmade for good practice times, and the fact that Phil didn\u2019t have many classes\nthis semester meant that he was there for almost every one of them. Work flowed\neasily and smoothly and on monday they were already done segmenting the song\nand deciding who would get to sing which parts.</p><p>But not\nonly the work went great, even their voices harmonized like they were meant to\nbe heard together. They didn\u2019t even need transitions between Dan\u2019s singing\nparts to Phil\u2019s, the changes from line to line went just as smoothly as the\nones with longer instrumental intervals between.</p><p>Tuesday\nevening they were basically ready to perform. Dan had his piano playing\nrecorded as a playback to make him more flexible on stage instead of immobile\nbehind a giant instrument. Phil\u2019s guitar skills maybe didn\u2019t quite match Jimmy\nHendrik\u2019s yet, but they were definitely up there, and he had the song down to a\nT. Neither of them had classes the next morning, so as they were leaving the\npractice room, Dan felt quite courageous from all the adrenaline still rushing\nthrough him after a perfect run - and he boldly asked Phil if he wanted to get\na coffee somewhere before retiring to their respective dorms.</p><p>Ten minutes\nlater they were sat in a coffee shop right off campus. Dan chose a cozy little\nbooth in the corner directly next to the window front while Phil went to get\ntheir coffees. When Dan took the first sip of his drink he almost spat it right\nback out, but instead moved to first eye the drink and then Phil suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cHow do you\nknow?\u201d he asked, his voice almost high pitched as he narrowed his eyes.</p><p><br>\nPhil just raised an eyebrow into an almost perfectly shaped curve, looking at\nDan questionably as he calmly took a sip of his coffee, not saying a word.</p><p>\u201cHow do you\nknow my order?\u201d Dan specified and watched incredulously as Phil\u2019s full,\u00a0<i>kissable\u00a0</i>lips\nspread into a wide grin. He could almost picture it, attaching his own lips\nonto his as they spread into the exact grin before the kisses started to get\nmore serious, more heated, Phil\u2019s fringe messed up, his cheeks red as clothes\nwere coming off\u2026</p><p><i>Oh my\ngod, stop betraying me, goddamn heart.</i></p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t.\nI just ordered two of my usual order.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s\nvoice ripped him out of his daydream and for a second he couldn\u2019t do much else\nthan stare in stunned silence. \u201cYou drink caramel Macchiato, too?\u201d he asked,\nblinking. Huh. He really hadn\u2019t expected that from a guy as\u00a0<i>hot\u00a0</i>as\nhim\u2026</p><p><i>Jesus\nfucking christ, actually shut the fuck up!</i></p><p>Dan\u2019s\nattraction to Phil had risen to an unhealthy level by now. Not only was he hot\nas fuck, no; during their practice time Dan also had had to learn that the guy\nwas smart, funny, lively, and talented as\u00a0<i>fuck\u00a0</i>, even more than\nDan remembered him to be. Dan was lucky the assignment, and working on the\nmusic kept him busy and focused, or else he would have probably jumped the guy\nby now.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my\nall time favorite,\u201d Phil confirmed, his grin transforming into a cheeky smile, and\nDan couldn\u2019t keep a blush from dusting his cheeks pink.</p><p>\u201cMine too,\u201d\nhe admitted and took another tentative sip from his drink, purposefully\navoiding Phil\u2019s eyes. He knew that if he looked into them now, he would\u00a0<i>drown\u00a0</i>in\nthem.</p><p>For a few\nmoments it was silent between them, both nursing their coffee, Dan deeply lost\nin thought about the blueness of Phil\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cSo, Muse,\nhuh?\u201d</p><p>It was Phil\nbreaking the silence and Dan looked up, surprised. It took him a second to\nrealize how Phil had even known he liked\u00a0<i>Muse\u00a0</i>, until he\nrealized they had met while singing their song\u00a0<i>Thought Contagion\u00a0</i>before\nchoosing it for their first performance. This time he was pretty sure he kept\nthe blush at bay.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\nlove them.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s\nmouth stretched into a happy smile, his eyes shining brightly, full of honest\nexcitement as he started chattering about them. Dan had to gulp and pinch his\nhand unsuspiciously to keep himself from losing his\u00a0<i>mind\u00a0</i>.</p><p>They moved\nfrom\u00a0<i>Muse\u00a0</i>to\u00a0<i>Panic!\u00a0</i>to\u00a0<i>Fallout\nBoy\u00a0</i>to\u00a0<i>Paramore\u00a0</i>and even further. Albums became\nscores, which lead the way to games, movies and TV shows. It was almost scary\nhow much they had in common, how much their interests overlapped, and it\nactually took Dan a while to remember a question he\u2019d had since he\u2019d heard of\nthe assigned groups.</p><p>He used a\ntemporary lull in conversation - one that he could have easily filled with\nsomething relatable to the topic they were on, mind you - to finally ask.</p><p>\u201cBy the\nway, do you know why we are the only duo?\u201d</p><p>Phil raised\nhis eyebrow, a cheeky smile back on his face and Dan knew there was a blush\ncreeping up his cheeks yet again. He couldn\u2019t help but feel like he missed\nsomething vital here, but he had no idea what exactly.</p><p>\u201cDid you\nnot pay attention at the meeting?\u201d</p><p>Dan felt\nhis eyes widen in surprise and blinked, cheeks even hotter than before. \u201cI\nmight have been\u2026\u00a0<i>preoccupied\u00a0</i>,\u201d he admitted and Phil\u2019s smile\ngrew into a full-blown grin.</p><p>\u201cProf.\nJohnson and Prof. Smith spent like ten minutes explaining,\u201d he informed Dan,\n\u201cApparently the numbers didn\u2019t match up and they had to have one duo, so they\nboth chose their best student and realized we would be a good\u00a0<i>match</i>.\u201d\nHe put special emphasis on the word\u00a0<i>match</i>\u00a0and for a second,\nDan wasn\u2019t sure if he would be able to stay conscious. Was he just making a\njoke\u2026 Or was Phil Lester\u00a0<i>really</i>\u00a0<i>flirting</i>\u00a0with him?</p><p>\u201cWe - we\nare,\u201d he stammered in response and Phil\u2019s chuckling send his heart into\noverdrive. Oh god. How was he supposed to survive at least 2 more months\nworking with the guy?</p><p>\u201cI think so\ntoo,\u201d Phil whispered back with a husky voice, making Dan choke on his long cold\ncoffee.</p><p><i>Fuck,\nthese next weeks are going to be torture.</i></p><p>~~~</p><p>The next\nmonday morning Dan found himself in yet another on-campus coffee shop, putting\nthe finishing touches on an assignment that was due today. Normally it was a\nbreak he would spend with Phil, but he had stuff to arrange with one of his\nprofessors, so they decided he would join up with Dan as soon as he was able\nto. They had managed to get a headstart on this week\u2019s performance by starting\nworking on it on saturday, so they weren\u2019t in much of a rush. They had decided\non a song and discussed divisioning on sunday already; it was only practicing left.</p><p>Of course\nthe performance on Friday had gone great. They had gotten a lot of applause by\nthe watching students, the little hall on campus used for performances had been\npacked to the rim, so there had been at least a few hundred watchers. The\nprofessors had obviously also been satisfied with their presentation,\nconsidering they had informed them they would progress into the next round even\nbefore the whole show had been over.</p><p>So Dan and\nPhil had spent their Friday night celebrating. Even though neither of them were\nreally the party going type, they had agreed to go out for a few drinks with\ntheir best friends Louise and PJ - who, coincidentally, were in the same group\n- and Tyler, a music production student Dan had been friends with for years. He\nhad flirted with Phil quite obviously and had teased Dan for his sour mood\nafterwards, but had assured him that\u00a0<i>Phil only has eyes for you, you\ndumbass, pay attention!</i>, coupled with a playful whack on his head.</p><p>The memory\nlet Dan grumble absently, but the arriving of a group of students in the booth\nright behind him ripped him away from his trip down memory lane. \u201cI mean,\nthey\u2019re both bisexual, right?\u201d one of the girls stated while taking a seat,\nmaking him peek up immediately. He liked to hear stories about his fellow\nunicorns and regretted only becoming aware of this conversation after it had\nalready started.</p><p>\u201cThey are,\u201d\na guy\u2019s voice confirmed. Dan was pretty sure he had heard the voice before, but\nhe didn\u2019t have the courage to turn around and check. He was lucky enough to not\nhave been spotted by the group, he really didn\u2019t have to push his luck.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen\ntheir sexual tension? I know you want to fuck them both, Caleb, but come on.\u201d\nThe female voice was followed by a male groan and the sound of a head meeting\nthe tabletop. \u201cI knowww,\u201d was the answer, \u201cI\u2019m sexually deprived, not\u00a0<i>blind\u00a0</i>.\u201d</p><p>Dan raked\nhis brain, trying to figure out who they were talking about. Being friends with\nLouise and Tyler meant that he was mostly up to date with recent campus gossip,\nand he really wanted to tell them about this later.</p><p>\u201cDid you\nknow there\u2019s already a bet going on? About if they\u2019ll be dating by the end of\nthis semester.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich\nidiot would even bet against that?\u201d</p><p>The booth\nerupted into laughter and Dan furrowed his eyebrows, thinking. He leaned\nforward, trying to appear busy, but in reality the assignment currently open on\nhis laptop was the furthest thing from his mind.</p><p>\u201cOkay, but\naside from all that they were the best group, even if it was just the two of\nthem. They\u2019re gonna win this thing, hands down.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes\nwent as wide as saucers as realization seeped into him. They weren\u2019t really\ntalking about -</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u00a0<i>Thought\nContagion\u00a0</i>was brilliant, I\u2019m so excited to see what they\u2019ll come up\nwith for the next round.\u201d</p><p>That was\nthe moment Phil decided to make his appearance, ripping him out of his thoughts\nalmost violently. \u201cMorning!\u201d he said, cheerfully, two cups of steaming coffee\nin his hands. He pushed one of them over to Dan after he had taken a seat.</p><p>A look of\nconfusion, even concern appeared on his face when Dan didn\u2019t react, just\ncontinued staring at his laptop screen with his eyes wide open. \u201cDan? Are you\nokay? Have you seen a ghost?\u201d</p><p>The chatter\nbehind him ended immediately. When he slowly turned around a group of seven\npeople was staring at him, wide eyed. All of them scrambled to their feets as\nfast as they could. \u201cYou\u2019re a cute couple!\u201d one of the girls squeaked out, then\nthey were gone, leaving Dan to explain the situation to Phil.</p><p>Needless to\nsay Phil wasn\u2019t fazed at all, instead he used the story to make more flirty\nremarks, making Dan blush yet again.</p><p><i>Damn,\nI\u2019m fucked.</i></p><p>~~~~</p><p><br>\nAlmost three months passed by in a rush and by december Dan couldn\u2019t even\nrecognize his life anymore. All the time he had previously spent alone in front\nof his laptop, browsing tumblr or watching Netflix, converted into Phil-time,\nslowly but surely. They played games or watched TV-Shows nearly every day after\npractice. Dan\u2019s roommate had even asked him if he was moving out with all the\ntime he spent away, but Dan couldn\u2019t help himself. Phil lived in a flat near\ncampus all alone. A tiny flat, sure, but it made for the best meetup place,\nespecially for gaming or movie nights or for research about their next song -\nand it gave them some privacy. Not that much had happened yet aside from the\nincreasingly flirty comments and occasional cuddle sessions, but it still made\ntheir friendship easier.</p><p>Especially\nbecause they were now something like campus-famous and got recognized wherever\nthey went.</p><p>So far,\nthey had aced most performances and were through to the last show before\nchristmas break. After New Year\u2019s there was only one show left before the big\nfinale. They were pretty sure they had a good grade secured, but they still\ngave it their all - they had come so far, there was no way they were giving up\nnow.</p><p>In the\nupcoming show only seven groups were left and it was the first one with two\nmandatory songs, one optional and one christmas themed, dropping the\u00a0<i>rock\u00a0</i>theme\njust for this once. Since the last week was cut short - Christmas break started\non thursday - they had an additional half week to prepare. Dan and Phil had\ndecided on\u00a0<i>Panic!\u00a0</i>\u2019s\u00a0<i>High Hopes\u00a0</i>for the first\nsong and\u00a0<i>Last Christmas\u00a0</i>for the second and as always, they had\nbeen quite fast with their work. They were practiced and basically done on\nMonday, so they allowed themselves the night off. Phil\u2019s brother was in town\nand Dan had\u00a0<i>heartlessly neglected\u00a0</i>Tyler since the assignment\nstarted (his words), basically forcing Dan to spent the night with him.</p><p>Fortunately\nTyler had a lecture early the next morning, so he wasn\u2019t trying to get himself\nor Dan trashed. He did, however, made use of the time by grilling Dan about his\nrelationship to Phil.</p><p>Dan was a\nbit annoyed, but at the end of the day he was glad to be able to talk about it,\neven if he would never admit to that. Louise and her group were still in the\nrun for the finals too, which made her so busy they barely were able to talk\nfor longer than a few minutes at a time - and he desperately needed an\noutsider\u2019s opinion.</p><p>It took him\nalmost an hour to get Tyler up to date on what had happened, all the while\ngetting interrupted by texts from Phil. Right when he was done explaining his\nphone dinged again, indicating another text.</p><p><i>\u2018the\ngirl two tables over has a cute lil pup on her lap i keep staring she probs\nthinks i\u2019m a perv help\u2019\u00a0</i>it read and he couldn\u2019t help but chuckle. Tyler inspected him warily\nfrom across the table, absently playing with the straw in his half-empty\ncocktail. \u201cOkay, who are you texting?\u201d he asked then, fixing Dan with a steely\ngaze.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s\njust Phil,\u201d he answered distractedly, typing a quick response before turning\nhis attention back to Tyler. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you\nshitting me?\u201d he asked back, a fitting expression on his face like he couldn\u2019t\nbelieve what he was hearing. Dan just answered with a surprised \u201chuh?\u201d,\nshooting him a confused look.</p><p>\u201cMate, how\ndense can you be? You are basically dating the guy, only without the good\nparts!\u201d</p><p>Dan\nblinked, completely lost now, unable to follow Tyler\u2019s train of thought.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and\nPhil are dating, Dan, wake up! The only thing missing is the sex!\u201d\u00a0<br><br>\nDan was stunned into silence, staring at Tyler like he had grown a second head.\nIt took the thought a while to register in his brain, but then he blushed,\ntaking a huge gulp of his drink before calling the waiter over to order another\none.</p><p>He needed\nmore alcohol for this.</p><p>~~~~</p><p>The show on\nwednesday evening went exceptionally well. They had the most fun rocking\nto\u00a0<i>High Hopes\u00a0</i>and got really festive during\u00a0<i>Last\nChristmas\u00a0</i>, with Dan at the Piano and Phil sat on top of it. Their\nprofessors called them over and into the next show immediately, making them\ngiddy and high on adrenaline in the process.</p><p>The\nchristmas party thrown by the rock music department started directly afterwards\nand PJ and Louise, immensely proud of their best friends even though their own\ngroup had been voted out, insisted on going. Still in an after show rush they\nagreed, but soon realized why they normally didn\u2019t like parties. It was loud,\nthe room stuffed with people and the food was average at best, and it took them\naround twenty minutes to revert back to the snacks table, where they hid from\nthe actual party.</p><p>When Louise,\nPJ and Tyler of all people found them, sporting a cheeky expression, Dan knew\nthey were fucked. They were leaning against a wall, talking and laughing with\neach other as much as the music allowed them to, and only a few people were\ninspecting them from afar.</p><p>\u201cDo you\nknow where you\u2019re standing?\u201d PJ asked when the group was within earshot and Dan\nraised an eyebrow. \u201cNext to the snacks table where we always are?\u201d he remarked\ndrily, making Phil chuckle next to him.</p><p>\u201cLook up!\u201d\nTyler singsonged with a high pitched voice and flattered his eyelashes with\nfaked innocence.</p><p>Dan perked\nup immediately. He knew that voice.</p><p>He didn\u2019t\neven need to look up to know what was fixated on the wall over their heads.</p><p>\u201cA\nMistletoe!\u201d Louise grinned so widely Dan was sure it had to hurt. He turned his\nattention to Phil, his heart throbbing in his chest on full speed.</p><p>There was a\ncheeky smile on the guitarist\u2019s face as he took a step closer, taking a hold of\nDan\u2019s head with both hands. \u201cThey want a kiss,\u201d he murmured, lowly, \u201clet\u2019s give\nthem a kiss.\u201d</p><p>The second\nhis lips met Phil\u2019s was like a firework going off everywhere inside of his\nbody. For a moment he forgot where he was, hell, even who he was, just\ncontinued kissing Phil with passion and lust and love. He didn\u2019t even hesitate\nopening up his mouth at Phil\u2019s silent request to let him in, too far gone to\ncare - hell, to even\u00a0<i>realize\u00a0</i>they had an audience.</p><p>The kiss\nlasted for minutes and it probably could have gone on much longer if there\nwouldn\u2019t have been a sudden outburst of applause. The blood took a second to\nreach Dan\u2019s brain after having rushed somewhere south only seconds ago, but\nwhen it did, it immediately spread into his cheeks. They broke apart, Dan\u2019s\nface still in Phil\u2019s hands, silently contemplating the recent event.</p><p>He had just\nkissed Phil Lester. In front of basically the whole rock music department.</p><p><i>Great.\nJust great.</i></p><p>The\napplause and whooping didn\u2019t stop soon and he couldn\u2019t do much more then to\nexchange a long look with Phil. They had a silent discussion Dan himself didn\u2019t\nknow the content of, until suddenly and with no indication there was panic on\nPhil\u2019s face as he hastily let go of Dan and scrambled to get his phone out of\nhis pocket. It was vibrating violently in his hands and Dan couldn\u2019t even blink\nby the time Phil rasped out a \u201cShit! My brother is waiting for me!\u201d and left in\na rush.</p><p>Dan stood\nthere, staring after Phil until most of the students had averted their gazes\nfrom him and went back to whatever they had been doing before. When the ice in\nhis veins freezing him into place finally dissipated, he groaned. He knew\nPhil\u2019s brother Martyn was picking him up for Christmas with their family, and\nhe wouldn\u2019t be back until january.</p><p><i>Of\ncourse. That\u2019s just my fucking luck.</i></p><p>~~~</p><p>He spent\nchristmas break in some sort of limbo, like his relationship to Phil was\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat, platonic and romantic at the same time. He knew the kiss had\nmeant something not only to him but also to Phil, that much had been obvious\nwith the way he had taken the offensive in deepening the kiss and how he had\nheld him afterwards. But that was about the amount of information Dan had, and\nneither of them mentioned the kiss on any level, so he decided to just ignore\nthe issue for now.</p><p>It did made\nhim jumpy and fidgety and mostly unable to focus, though, and only his frequent\nskype calls with Phil got him focused and concentrated enough to get some much\nneeded work done.</p><p>There were\nonly two shows left, but they were only one week apart and both required three\nsongs, so they decided to learn all songs over the break. They spent hours on\nskype, deciding on the songs and how to play and sing them, so they would be\ndone learning their personal parts until they could meet back up in person.</p><p>For a short\nmoment, their reunion was like the sun had risen again. They hugged, soft words\nof attachment and longing on their lips, but then it was like someone had\nflipped a switch and they were back in working mode. Phil didn\u2019t mention the\nkiss and Dan didn\u2019t dare to, so they went back to Status Quo, just like that.</p><p>The first\nshow in the new year went okay-ish. Neither of them poured everything into it,\nalready looking forward to the songs they had chosen for the finale, but they\nstill managed to pull through. Their only truly memorable performance was\u00a0<i>The\nBlack Parade\u00a0</i>by\u00a0<i>My Chemical Romance\u00a0</i>, which they\ndefinitely aced, but the other ones admittedly fell a bit flat. Both their\nprofessors urged them to not take it too lightly just because they had done so\namazingly until now, so they swore to give everything they had in their last\nperformances together.</p><p>They were\nthe first group performing in the finale. It wasn\u2019t hard for Dan to get in the\nmood of their songs, considering they were all pining lovesongs and he would\nhave the one he was pining after up on stage with him, so he was glad they got\nto go first. It made the waiting and anticipation in between easier, and\nwaiting for the results when they were done didn\u2019t mean much to him anyway - he\ndidn\u2019t care too much about winning.</p><p>He just\nwanted to give his best, pour all his feelings into the songs when he was up\nthere with Phil. He wanted to make it obvious that he meant every word he was\nsinging.</p><p>He wanted\nto get Phil to understand\u2026</p><p>In short,\nhe just wanted Phil.</p><p>Their first\nsong was a soft piano interpretation of\u00a0<i>It\u2019s not living (If it\u2019s not\nwith you)\u00a0</i>by\u00a0<i>The 1975\u00a0</i>, and Dan was so entranced by\nPhil he forgot to look at his hands while playing. He didn\u2019t make a single\nmistake, thankfully, \u00a0but if he would have made one he probably wouldn\u2019t\neven have noticed. He benefited from the fact that he had practiced the piano\npart so often on the tiny piano in his childhood bedroom that his parents had\nasked him to please,\u00a0<i>please\u00a0</i>stop.</p><p>They spent\ntheir break with a bottle of coke huddled together on a tiny sofa backstage,\nmaking loose conversation and trying to get their mind off of things. Dan\nbasked in the close physical proximity and simply smiled when Phil just\ncasually took his hand while he talked, playing with his fingers. He had a\nfeeling that things would be going well.</p><p>Dan had\nparticularly fun during their next song.\u00a0<i>The Last Of The Real\nOnes\u00a0</i>by\u00a0<i>Fallout Boy\u00a0</i>was one of his favorite songs and\nhe connected a lot of the lyrics to Phil. The piano playing was not an issue\nthis time since they had both laid down their playing previously and conjoined\nit in a track, so he had all the time in the world to focus on Phil, which he\ntook full advantage of. They riled up the crowd so much that Tyler, who had agreed\nto be the presenter of the night, had trouble getting them back in check for\nthe next group.</p><p>During\nchristmas break, far away from Phil and his feelings, their next song had\nseemed like a good idea. It was romantic, emotional and full of love and Dan\ncouldn\u2019t think of any other song that would make his feelings for Phil more\nclear than this.</p><p>Now,\nthough, it seemed entirely too personal to perform in front of what felt like\nthe whole Uni. During practice he had refrained from building too much of a\nconnection, afraid of taking it too far, but now he didn\u2019t have much of a\nchoice and it made him more nervous than any other performance before. His\nhands were sweaty, his stomach was rumbling and he was ready to cancel the\nwhole thing when Phil noticed the state he was in.</p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d he\nwhispered, pointedly ignoring the other people lounging around backstage,\ncompletely focusing on Dan, \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay.\u00a0<i>You\u00a0</i>will be okay.\nAnd I will be with you, right there by your side the whole time, okay?\u201d</p><p>It was in\nthis moment that something settled in Dan\u2019s chest. He returned Phil\u2019s fond look\nwith courage and determination, grasping his hand in his and squeezing it\ntightly. \u201cMe too. We\u2019re on the same page.\u201d</p><p>He was sure\nPhil caught the double meaning when his look got soft. \u201cI think I always knew,\u201d\nhe answered quietly, almost inaudible. \u201cLet\u2019s do this.\u201d</p><p>~~~</p><p>Their last\nperformance of this assignment was a complete success. They performed\u00a0<i>The\nOnly Exception\u00a0</i>by\u00a0<i>Paramore\u00a0</i>sitting huddled together\non the little Piano stool in front of the huge piano and didn\u2019t take their eyes\noff of each other the entire time. It was so emotional Tyler had tears in his\neyes when he came on stage, hugging first Phil, then Dan tightly, muttering a\nsoft \u201cgo get \u2018em, tiger\u201d into Dan\u2019s ear and Dan could feel his heart swelling.</p><p>This was\nit.</p><p>Backstage,\nthankfully, they were alone. Both of the other groups were nowhere to be seen,\nand Phil obviously noticed faster than him.</p><p>Before he\neven had the chance to turn around from closing the door he was already spun\naround and pressed against the next hard surface, Phil\u2019s lips attacking his\nown.</p><p>For what\nfelt like ages they were kissing furiously, like they had deprived themselves\nof this for far too long and now a dam had been broken down, nothing holding\nthem back anymore.</p><p>Once they\nwere out of breath Phil separated their lips, lovingly gazing into his eyes\ninstead. \u201cI have waited for this for far too long,\u201d he whispered quietly,\nsoftly, his hands on the sides of Dan\u2019s head, his thumbs gently caressing his\ncheeks.</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d\nhe mumbled back, drowning in Phil\u2019s eyes and feeling himself falling, falling;\nfalling even deeper in love with him. \u201cI meant every word I sang.\u201d</p><p>There was a\nbeat of quiet, then:</p><p>\u201cI love\nyou.\u201d</p><p>The words\nwere muttered completely simultaneously, and for the single bat of an eye both\nstared at the other, stunned into silence.</p><p>Then they\nwere both dissolving into giggles, holding onto the other to keep from toppling\nover.</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d\nPhil gasped out, \u201cwas so us.\u201d</p><p>Dan\ncouldn\u2019t help but agree.</p><p>~~~</p><p>\u201cDo you\nreally think so, Badiha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\nknow, Henry, but they did seem smitten during that song, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue!\u201d</p><p>There was a\ngroup of at least five people seated in the booth directly behind Dan\u2019s and\neven though he wasn\u2019t that much of a gossip he couldn\u2019t help but eavesdrop. He\nwas busily procrastinating the work he needed to do until the next day,\nrefreshing tumblr around ten times a minute, so it wasn\u2019t too surprising the\nconversation distracted him as soon as it got loud enough for him to hear.</p><p>\u201cBut they\nhaven\u2019t been seen in public with each other in ages aside from their\nperformances. I just really want them to be happy with each other, is that too\nmuch to ask?\u201d</p><p>That was\nthe first voice again. Dan allowed himself a short look at the group out of the\ncorner of his eyes and recognized all faces he was able to pick up on. They had\nall been to the performance Phil and him did twice a week in a near bar ever\nsince their joint assignment last year, he was sure of it. He mostly recognized\nthem because of the person that had spoken first, a girl with the pride flag\ndrawn on her eyelids. He remembered how she had attracted his attention during\ntheir first show because of her truly iconic makeup.</p><p>\u201cI know,\nright?!\u201d a male voice joined in and this time Dan didn\u2019t need the information\npractically jumping into his face to realize they were talking about him and\nPhil.</p><p>After their\nwin in the finale they had decided to keep their relationship at a down low,\ntrying to make themselves comfortable with being boyfriends before they truly\nmade it public. They were still pretty famous throughout the students and the\ncenter of the rumor mill, but they had been in a relationship for almost a year\nnow and had only recently realized there was nothing to be afraid of if\neverybody knew. Most of them would be happy for them, and the rest of them,\nwell -</p><p>They\u2019d just\nhave to suck it up.</p><p>That was\nthe moment his boyfriend decided to show up. He slid into the booth, taking a\nseat directly next to Dan, pressing their thighs together. \u201cMorning, love,\u201d he\ngreeted Dan gently, planting a kiss on his cheek before grinning happily. \u201cBusy\nprocrastinating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dan\nreplied extra loud, grinning right back, \u201cbut I\u2019d rather kiss my boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>So they\nshared a short, cute kiss, making the group behind them gasp loudly. \u201cIt\u2019s\nthem,\u201d the girl with the pride flag on her eyelids whispered into the silence\nstretching between them. Dan grinned.</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d he\nconfirmed cheekily, turning around to look at her. \u201cVery iconic Make-up by the\nway, I like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god,\nthank you,\u201d she answered, a blush becoming apparent on her cheeks and Dan\u2019s\ngrin only got wider before he turned his attention back around to Phil.</p><p>\u201cWhat was\nthat about?\u201d he asked with a raised eyebrow and his head cutely tilted to the\nside.</p><p>Dan pecked\nhim on the lips. \u201cHad to make a point.\u201d</p><p>Phil looked\nback cheekily, a grin on his face so wide Dan was able to see his tongue poking\nout between his teeth. \u201cA point about what?\u201d</p><p>Dan puffed\nout his cheeks, feigning huffiness. Phil knew\u00a0<i>exactly\u00a0</i>what\nthis was about, and they were both aware of that. \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot,\u201d he said,\npouting.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but\nI\u2019m\u00a0<i>your\u00a0</i>idiot.\u201d</p><p>Dan looked\nat him, eyes full of fondness and adoration and love. \u201cExactly.\u201d</p>",
                "content": "<p><b>Summary:</b>&nbsp;\n\nDan Howell&rsquo;s life as a student of modern piano music is completely turned upside down when he is grouped in an assignment with Phil Lester&hellip;\n\n</p><p><b>Word Count:</b> 7,2k</p><p><b>Tags:</b> University AU, Fluff, Pianist!Dan, Guitarist!Phil,&nbsp;</p><p><b>A/n: </b>This is written for <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0M4Qtg9Ia8G4aO6XmCJl_Q\">@babethepig</a> for the Phandom fic Fests Holiday Exchange.<br />As always the biggest ever thank you goes out to my love <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mufvz9WVyRT0StTpRn5wTWw\">@succubusphan</a>, who spent a lot of time beta&rsquo;ing this. You&rsquo;re the best. &lt;3&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17125400\">Read on A03</a></p><p>Dans\nschedule was a proper mess this semester. His decision to specialize in modern\npiano music got frowned upon not only by his parents but also by his Uni, so\nhis curses were not nicely fit together anymore. He had a lot of free time in\nbetween, but his time gaps were too short to get back to his dorm, so he mostly\nstayed on campus, spending his free time in one of the multiple coffee shops\naround or with his friend Louise, who was assigned a dorm room much closer to\ncampus than he was.</p><p>That&rsquo;s how\nhe caught wind of it first.</p><p>He had\nalways been good at playing the piano, the time at uni had only helped with\nthat, obviously; but that he was supposedly the best in his studies had always\nsounded like an exaggeration. There were a lot of piano students, so he had\ntried toning down the people talking about him, directing them to someone else.\nAside from his musical ability there wasn&rsquo;t much interesting about him, though,\nso he had drifted out of the other students&rsquo; eyes - at least aside from the\ntalk about whoever was supposed to be dating this week. His open bisexuality\nmade for a large pool of possible suitors, but there were students much more\ninteresting to talk about.</p><p>Now,\nthough, he was back inside of the rumor mill, and right in the center.</p><p>It started\noff innocently enough.</p><p>&ldquo;The\ninstruments students are doing trios this year, did you hear?&rdquo; The two girls in\nthe booth right next to his were chatting animatedly with each other, obviously\nunaware of him just sitting half a meter away. &ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m so excited! We\nhaven&rsquo;t seen Dan Howell performing for a while, which is a shame. Him at a\nPiano is enough to get me going to be honest.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan was\nalready puffing out his chest like a peacock, debating on whether to go over\nthere or at least make his presence known otherwise, when the other girl&rsquo;s\nreply made him halt in his tracks. &ldquo;I mean&nbsp;<i>same&nbsp;</i>, but have you\nseen Phil Lester lately? He got rid of his emo fringe and stuff. He&rsquo;s\nscolding&nbsp;<i>hot&nbsp;</i>.&rdquo; She layed extra emphasis on the word hot and\nin Dan&rsquo;s head, two mindsets started battling over what to do. The first one\nexpressed some kind of jealousy in a &ldquo;I wanted to tap that girl&rdquo;-kind of way,\nthe other one wanted to spring onto facebook to check out the guy they were\ntalking about, whose name sounded kind of familiar.</p><p>Former emo\nfringe musician that got hot? Sign him the fuck up.</p><p>Chuckling\nlowly about his screaming bisexuality he continued listening, his interest now\npeaked.</p><p>&ldquo;Well,\nthey&rsquo;re doing trios right? Just imagine both of them on stage together&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>The other\ngirl actually moaned at the thought and Dan couldn&rsquo;t contain the smirk creeping\non his face. He took a sip from his coffee, his still open laptop on the table\nin front of him long forgotten. He probably should be working on one of his\nassignments due this week, but the girls&rsquo; conversation was too interesting to\nignore.</p><p>Dan had to\nsuppress some swearing when his laptop dinged with an incoming email. He could\nhear the girls whispering behind him when they looked over because of the\nsound, realizing who he was - &ldquo;Oh my god is that Dan Howell?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Oh my god,\ndo you think he heard us?&rdquo; - &nbsp;and he quickly leaned forward to appear busy.</p><p>The email\ncausing the &lsquo;ding&rsquo; was actually about the assignment the girls had just been\ntalking about. He packed up his stuff immediately when he had read through it.\nThe list of assigned groups had just been hung out in front of his professor&rsquo;s\noffice and she invited all participants to a meeting in about half an hour on\nthe other side of the campus, so he had to rush.</p><p>~~~</p><p>Even the\nrushing didn&rsquo;t help in the end, the unfortunate incident of a broken down bus\ncosted him the time to check the list before the meeting started. When he got\nthere he still had no idea who his partners were, so he didn&rsquo;t understand the\nreason behind the quiet whispers that started when he set foot into the lecture\nhall. He managed to find his friend Louise quite fast and slid into the free\nspot next to her. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the fuss about?&rdquo; he asked her quietly but before she\ncould answer, the door opened again and a group of professors walked in.</p><p>Their looks\nvaried about as much as those of the students sitting in the audience, making\nfor a quite colourful group. For this assignment, nearly all rock-centered\ncurses were thrown together, not only piano but also guitar, drums, bass,\nviolin and multiple other instruments. The hall was packed full, but the\narrival of the professors assured silence among the students.</p><p>&ldquo;Good\nmorning everyone! Hopefully you all checked the list and are in the process of\ncontacting your partners. Teamwork is the key for this assignment! Because of\nthe number of students most groups consist of one piano student, one guitar\nstudent and one of another instrument, specifically arranged to play into your\nstrengths and make you work on your weaknesses.&rdquo; The young male professor&rsquo;s\nvoice rung soundly through the hall and Dan couldn&rsquo;t help but raise an eyebrow.\nProf. Smith, responsible for the guitar department and &nbsp;specialized on\nrock music, was so completely different from his own professor and so clich&eacute;\nrock musician that it offended Dan&rsquo;s believes; he fit the stereotype perfectly,\nincluding tattoo covered arms, piercings and wild, green hair, often sporting\nband shirts.</p><p>Prof.\nJohnson, on the other hand, was nothing like her profession. She was a\nmiddle-aged woman with slim, neon green glasses and grey eyes that always\nseemed to shine with mischief. Her jet black hair fell in untamable curls onto\nher shoulders and she seemed to never leave the house without a nerdy T-Shirt,\nmerch for some comic, TV-Show or movie. When she stepped forward, the whispers\naround the hall got louder and the grin on her face was so wide Dan couldn&rsquo;t\nhelp but grin back. He liked his Professor, even if she tended to overstep her\nboundaries and was eager to make friends among the students.</p><p>&ldquo;If you\nhave questions you can always turn to me or Mr. Smith, Mr. Miller or Mrs.\nAdams, or any of the other Professors involved,&rdquo; she said, then paused for a\nsecond to let the murmures and voices ring out.</p><p>&ldquo;Now, we\nknow this is a big thing among the student body, but we hope you can keep it as\nlow as possible. Drama and relations, as fun as they are to watch for us, will\nonly make your work harder. If you want to outplay this though, be assured I\nwill be watching with a glass of wine and popcorn.&rdquo; There were chuckles among\nthe group and Louise next to him went red trying to keep in her laughter. Dan\ngrinned at her and made a mental note to tell her about the girls he had\nencountered before coming here.</p><p><br />\nIt took some time for the students to calm down, but when she continued\nspeaking, Dan was shocked into silence. &ldquo;That also goes for other students\naside from yourself. The list is out for half an hour and the only duo\ninvolving Mr. Howell and Mr. Lester has already caused an uproar throughout the\nwhole university, so please think about what you are causing when you speak\nabout information like this next time.&rdquo;</p><p>The rest of\nthe meeting went by in a blur. The professors informed them of the nature of\nthe assignment - the whole thing had pretty much the built-up of a generic\ntalent show. They had to cover one song each week in an open, on-campus concert\nstarting in two weeks. Each week two groups would be voted out by the\nprofessors until three groups remained for the finale.</p><p>At the end\nDan didn&rsquo;t remember anything the professors had explained to them. He would beg\nLouise for her notes tomorrow, but that wasn&rsquo;t the important thing right now.</p><p>The\nimportant thing was that he was supposed to perform with the one and only Phil\nLester - and after a quick facebook check he realized why the name had sounded\nso familiar. Dan had had a crush on the cute and amazingly talented guitar\nplayer performing every saturday in a close-by coffee shop for weeks until he\nhad disappeared. What made it even harder for Dan was the fact that the girls\nhad been right.</p><p>The guy had\ngotten&nbsp;<i>hot as fuck</i>.</p><p>Louise&rsquo;\nmumbled&nbsp;<i>keep it in your pants&nbsp;</i>seemed almost impossible to\nstick to.</p><p>~~~~</p><p>It took Dan\naround half a week to stop running from Phil. He kept himself busy with papers\nnot due for at least a few more weeks and working harder for other assignments\nthan he ever had before - he did anything that would make him forget about the\nshort message from Phil awaiting him on whatsapp, where he introduced himself\nand informed him they were partners. The little dog emoji at the end of the\nmessage made him squeal like a schoolgirl, but that was exactly the problem. He\nhad to keep it professional. Which would be difficult considering the increasingly\nhot pictures Phil posted on his facebook and instagram&hellip;</p><p>On thursday\nDan finally realized he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to hide from this forever, as he\ncouldn&rsquo;t afford to fail this class. So he decided to suck it up and went with a\ngeneric confirmation and the question to set a time for their first rehearsal\nas a reply.</p><p>On friday\nDan was about as nervous as he could be. Fidgeting the entire morning, he\nchanged his outfit for at least five times until Louise threatened to rip his\nwhole wardrobe to shreds if he didn&rsquo;t decide soon. Her teasing didn&rsquo;t make his\njob any easier though. He was supposed to meet Phil in less than half an hour\nin one of the practice rooms in the music building half a campus away and he\nwas dying a little.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you\nreally think I look okay?&rdquo; he asked Louise, who was seated directly next to him\non the bus, anxiously running his fingers through his brown locks. Louise\ncaught his wrist mid-movement and forced his hand back into his lap before she\npatted it sympathetically. &ldquo;You look great, Dan. Just don&rsquo;t behave like the\nlittle schoolgirl you&rsquo;re portraying right now, okay?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan\ncouldn&rsquo;t get rid of the blush creeping onto his cheeks for the rest of the bus\nride.</p><p>When he\narrived at their booked practice room, Phil wasn&rsquo;t there yet. Sighing in\nrelief, he let his backpack sink to the floor before moving over to the piano,\nsituated on a little pedestal in front of the window. He took a seat on the\nstool right in front of it and let his fingers run over the keys testingly. A\nseries of notes rang through the air and he realized delightedly that the piano\nwas pitched precisely.</p><p>He let his\nfingers push the keys purposefully and before he knew it they strung together\nto one of his favorite songs. He started singing along, just for the fun of it;\nbut he got completely lost in the music. At one point a second voice joined in,\nharmonizing with him to an unbelievable extend, but he didn&rsquo;t even realize; it\njust sounded like it had been there from the start.</p><p>Like it\nbelonged there, ringing alongside his own.</p><p>Only at the\nend of the song he realized what had happened. When the last note rang loud\nthrough the now deafening silence he whipped around, eyes wide - and met the\nbluest eyes he had ever seen.</p><p>He wanted\nto avert his eyes, wanted to check who it was, but he couldn&rsquo;t; for a few\nmoments, he was frozen, lost in time, no connection to reality except for the\nblue he was drowning in.</p><p>The moment\nshattered like glass around him when some kind of crashing noise pierced in\nfrom outside of the room and Dan was finally able to move his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;That was\nbeautiful,&rdquo; a deep, melodic voice said and he couldn&rsquo;t help but stare at the\nblack haired figure standing proudly and tall at the other end of the piano,\nsmiling at him reassuringly.</p><p>Dan had to\nblink a few times and pinch himself covertly, but the picture in front of him\nstayed the same: Phil Lester, in all his delicious glory, eyes shining so\nbright Dan was sure he&rsquo;d need sunglasses.</p><p>&ldquo;It was,&rdquo;\nhe agreed with a raspy voice, watching wordlessly as Phil made his way over to\nhim. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Phil,&rdquo; he said, sticking out his hand in front of him and Dan had to\ngulp down his fast rising excitement.&nbsp;<i>I&rsquo;ll get to touch Phil Lester!!</i></p><p>When it happened,\nwhen their hands touched, he almost flinched back. A warm feeling shot up his\narm at top speed and for a second, he forgot how to breathe.&nbsp;<i>Holy shit.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Dan,&rdquo; he\nrasped back, staring up at Phil with wide eyes, not really sure what to do with\nhimself, only one thought ringing through his mind - if touching Phil felt\nlike&nbsp;<i>that&nbsp;</i>, how amazing would kissing him be?</p><p>Obviously,\nthe black haired guitar player was not as shocked as Dan. &ldquo;So, do you think we\nfound our song for the first show?&rdquo;</p><p>Just like\nthat they slipped over into work - and working with Phil, Dan learned, was just\nas easy as breathing.</p><p>~~~</p><p>The first\nweek with Phil was like walking on clouds. The numerous holes in Dan&rsquo;s schedule\nmade for good practice times, and the fact that Phil didn&rsquo;t have many classes\nthis semester meant that he was there for almost every one of them. Work flowed\neasily and smoothly and on monday they were already done segmenting the song\nand deciding who would get to sing which parts.</p><p>But not\nonly the work went great, even their voices harmonized like they were meant to\nbe heard together. They didn&rsquo;t even need transitions between Dan&rsquo;s singing\nparts to Phil&rsquo;s, the changes from line to line went just as smoothly as the\nones with longer instrumental intervals between.</p><p>Tuesday\nevening they were basically ready to perform. Dan had his piano playing\nrecorded as a playback to make him more flexible on stage instead of immobile\nbehind a giant instrument. Phil&rsquo;s guitar skills maybe didn&rsquo;t quite match Jimmy\nHendrik&rsquo;s yet, but they were definitely up there, and he had the song down to a\nT. Neither of them had classes the next morning, so as they were leaving the\npractice room, Dan felt quite courageous from all the adrenaline still rushing\nthrough him after a perfect run - and he boldly asked Phil if he wanted to get\na coffee somewhere before retiring to their respective dorms.</p><p>Ten minutes\nlater they were sat in a coffee shop right off campus. Dan chose a cozy little\nbooth in the corner directly next to the window front while Phil went to get\ntheir coffees. When Dan took the first sip of his drink he almost spat it right\nback out, but instead moved to first eye the drink and then Phil suspiciously.</p><p>&ldquo;How do you\nknow?&rdquo; he asked, his voice almost high pitched as he narrowed his eyes.</p><p><br />\nPhil just raised an eyebrow into an almost perfectly shaped curve, looking at\nDan questionably as he calmly took a sip of his coffee, not saying a word.</p><p>&ldquo;How do you\nknow my order?&rdquo; Dan specified and watched incredulously as Phil&rsquo;s full,&nbsp;<i>kissable&nbsp;</i>lips\nspread into a wide grin. He could almost picture it, attaching his own lips\nonto his as they spread into the exact grin before the kisses started to get\nmore serious, more heated, Phil&rsquo;s fringe messed up, his cheeks red as clothes\nwere coming off&hellip;</p><p><i>Oh my\ngod, stop betraying me, goddamn heart.</i></p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t.\nI just ordered two of my usual order.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s\nvoice ripped him out of his daydream and for a second he couldn&rsquo;t do much else\nthan stare in stunned silence. &ldquo;You drink caramel Macchiato, too?&rdquo; he asked,\nblinking. Huh. He really hadn&rsquo;t expected that from a guy as&nbsp;<i>hot&nbsp;</i>as\nhim&hellip;</p><p><i>Jesus\nfucking christ, actually shut the fuck up!</i></p><p>Dan&rsquo;s\nattraction to Phil had risen to an unhealthy level by now. Not only was he hot\nas fuck, no; during their practice time Dan also had had to learn that the guy\nwas smart, funny, lively, and talented as&nbsp;<i>fuck&nbsp;</i>, even more than\nDan remembered him to be. Dan was lucky the assignment, and working on the\nmusic kept him busy and focused, or else he would have probably jumped the guy\nby now.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my\nall time favorite,&rdquo; Phil confirmed, his grin transforming into a cheeky smile, and\nDan couldn&rsquo;t keep a blush from dusting his cheeks pink.</p><p>&ldquo;Mine too,&rdquo;\nhe admitted and took another tentative sip from his drink, purposefully\navoiding Phil&rsquo;s eyes. He knew that if he looked into them now, he would&nbsp;<i>drown&nbsp;</i>in\nthem.</p><p>For a few\nmoments it was silent between them, both nursing their coffee, Dan deeply lost\nin thought about the blueness of Phil&rsquo;s eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;So, Muse,\nhuh?&rdquo;</p><p>It was Phil\nbreaking the silence and Dan looked up, surprised. It took him a second to\nrealize how Phil had even known he liked&nbsp;<i>Muse&nbsp;</i>, until he\nrealized they had met while singing their song&nbsp;<i>Thought Contagion&nbsp;</i>before\nchoosing it for their first performance. This time he was pretty sure he kept\nthe blush at bay.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. I\nlove them.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s\nmouth stretched into a happy smile, his eyes shining brightly, full of honest\nexcitement as he started chattering about them. Dan had to gulp and pinch his\nhand unsuspiciously to keep himself from losing his&nbsp;<i>mind&nbsp;</i>.</p><p>They moved\nfrom&nbsp;<i>Muse&nbsp;</i>to&nbsp;<i>Panic!&nbsp;</i>to&nbsp;<i>Fallout\nBoy&nbsp;</i>to&nbsp;<i>Paramore&nbsp;</i>and even further. Albums became\nscores, which lead the way to games, movies and TV shows. It was almost scary\nhow much they had in common, how much their interests overlapped, and it\nactually took Dan a while to remember a question he&rsquo;d had since he&rsquo;d heard of\nthe assigned groups.</p><p>He used a\ntemporary lull in conversation - one that he could have easily filled with\nsomething relatable to the topic they were on, mind you - to finally ask.</p><p>&ldquo;By the\nway, do you know why we are the only duo?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil raised\nhis eyebrow, a cheeky smile back on his face and Dan knew there was a blush\ncreeping up his cheeks yet again. He couldn&rsquo;t help but feel like he missed\nsomething vital here, but he had no idea what exactly.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you\nnot pay attention at the meeting?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan felt\nhis eyes widen in surprise and blinked, cheeks even hotter than before. &ldquo;I\nmight have been&hellip;&nbsp;<i>preoccupied&nbsp;</i>,&rdquo; he admitted and Phil&rsquo;s smile\ngrew into a full-blown grin.</p><p>&ldquo;Prof.\nJohnson and Prof. Smith spent like ten minutes explaining,&rdquo; he informed Dan,\n&ldquo;Apparently the numbers didn&rsquo;t match up and they had to have one duo, so they\nboth chose their best student and realized we would be a good&nbsp;<i>match</i>.&rdquo;\nHe put special emphasis on the word&nbsp;<i>match</i>&nbsp;and for a second,\nDan wasn&rsquo;t sure if he would be able to stay conscious. Was he just making a\njoke&hellip; Or was Phil Lester&nbsp;<i>really</i>&nbsp;<i>flirting</i>&nbsp;with him?</p><p>&ldquo;We - we\nare,&rdquo; he stammered in response and Phil&rsquo;s chuckling send his heart into\noverdrive. Oh god. How was he supposed to survive at least 2 more months\nworking with the guy?</p><p>&ldquo;I think so\ntoo,&rdquo; Phil whispered back with a husky voice, making Dan choke on his long cold\ncoffee.</p><p><i>Fuck,\nthese next weeks are going to be torture.</i></p><p>~~~</p><p>The next\nmonday morning Dan found himself in yet another on-campus coffee shop, putting\nthe finishing touches on an assignment that was due today. Normally it was a\nbreak he would spend with Phil, but he had stuff to arrange with one of his\nprofessors, so they decided he would join up with Dan as soon as he was able\nto. They had managed to get a headstart on this week&rsquo;s performance by starting\nworking on it on saturday, so they weren&rsquo;t in much of a rush. They had decided\non a song and discussed divisioning on sunday already; it was only practicing left.</p><p>Of course\nthe performance on Friday had gone great. They had gotten a lot of applause by\nthe watching students, the little hall on campus used for performances had been\npacked to the rim, so there had been at least a few hundred watchers. The\nprofessors had obviously also been satisfied with their presentation,\nconsidering they had informed them they would progress into the next round even\nbefore the whole show had been over.</p><p>So Dan and\nPhil had spent their Friday night celebrating. Even though neither of them were\nreally the party going type, they had agreed to go out for a few drinks with\ntheir best friends Louise and PJ - who, coincidentally, were in the same group\n- and Tyler, a music production student Dan had been friends with for years. He\nhad flirted with Phil quite obviously and had teased Dan for his sour mood\nafterwards, but had assured him that&nbsp;<i>Phil only has eyes for you, you\ndumbass, pay attention!</i>, coupled with a playful whack on his head.</p><p>The memory\nlet Dan grumble absently, but the arriving of a group of students in the booth\nright behind him ripped him away from his trip down memory lane. &ldquo;I mean,\nthey&rsquo;re both bisexual, right?&rdquo; one of the girls stated while taking a seat,\nmaking him peek up immediately. He liked to hear stories about his fellow\nunicorns and regretted only becoming aware of this conversation after it had\nalready started.</p><p>&ldquo;They are,&rdquo;\na guy&rsquo;s voice confirmed. Dan was pretty sure he had heard the voice before, but\nhe didn&rsquo;t have the courage to turn around and check. He was lucky enough to not\nhave been spotted by the group, he really didn&rsquo;t have to push his luck.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you seen\ntheir sexual tension? I know you want to fuck them both, Caleb, but come on.&rdquo;\nThe female voice was followed by a male groan and the sound of a head meeting\nthe tabletop. &ldquo;I knowww,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sexually deprived, not&nbsp;<i>blind&nbsp;</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan raked\nhis brain, trying to figure out who they were talking about. Being friends with\nLouise and Tyler meant that he was mostly up to date with recent campus gossip,\nand he really wanted to tell them about this later.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you\nknow there&rsquo;s already a bet going on? About if they&rsquo;ll be dating by the end of\nthis semester.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Which\nidiot would even bet against that?&rdquo;</p><p>The booth\nerupted into laughter and Dan furrowed his eyebrows, thinking. He leaned\nforward, trying to appear busy, but in reality the assignment currently open on\nhis laptop was the furthest thing from his mind.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, but\naside from all that they were the best group, even if it was just the two of\nthem. They&rsquo;re gonna win this thing, hands down.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s eyes\nwent as wide as saucers as realization seeped into him. They weren&rsquo;t really\ntalking about -</p><p>&ldquo;Absolutely.&nbsp;<i>Thought\nContagion&nbsp;</i>was brilliant, I&rsquo;m so excited to see what they&rsquo;ll come up\nwith for the next round.&rdquo;</p><p>That was\nthe moment Phil decided to make his appearance, ripping him out of his thoughts\nalmost violently. &ldquo;Morning!&rdquo; he said, cheerfully, two cups of steaming coffee\nin his hands. He pushed one of them over to Dan after he had taken a seat.</p><p>A look of\nconfusion, even concern appeared on his face when Dan didn&rsquo;t react, just\ncontinued staring at his laptop screen with his eyes wide open. &ldquo;Dan? Are you\nokay? Have you seen a ghost?&rdquo;</p><p>The chatter\nbehind him ended immediately. When he slowly turned around a group of seven\npeople was staring at him, wide eyed. All of them scrambled to their feets as\nfast as they could. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a cute couple!&rdquo; one of the girls squeaked out, then\nthey were gone, leaving Dan to explain the situation to Phil.</p><p>Needless to\nsay Phil wasn&rsquo;t fazed at all, instead he used the story to make more flirty\nremarks, making Dan blush yet again.</p><p><i>Damn,\nI&rsquo;m fucked.</i></p><p>~~~~</p><p><br />\nAlmost three months passed by in a rush and by december Dan couldn&rsquo;t even\nrecognize his life anymore. All the time he had previously spent alone in front\nof his laptop, browsing tumblr or watching Netflix, converted into Phil-time,\nslowly but surely. They played games or watched TV-Shows nearly every day after\npractice. Dan&rsquo;s roommate had even asked him if he was moving out with all the\ntime he spent away, but Dan couldn&rsquo;t help himself. Phil lived in a flat near\ncampus all alone. A tiny flat, sure, but it made for the best meetup place,\nespecially for gaming or movie nights or for research about their next song -\nand it gave them some privacy. Not that much had happened yet aside from the\nincreasingly flirty comments and occasional cuddle sessions, but it still made\ntheir friendship easier.</p><p>Especially\nbecause they were now something like campus-famous and got recognized wherever\nthey went.</p><p>So far,\nthey had aced most performances and were through to the last show before\nchristmas break. After New Year&rsquo;s there was only one show left before the big\nfinale. They were pretty sure they had a good grade secured, but they still\ngave it their all - they had come so far, there was no way they were giving up\nnow.</p><p>In the\nupcoming show only seven groups were left and it was the first one with two\nmandatory songs, one optional and one christmas themed, dropping the&nbsp;<i>rock&nbsp;</i>theme\njust for this once. Since the last week was cut short - Christmas break started\non thursday - they had an additional half week to prepare. Dan and Phil had\ndecided on&nbsp;<i>Panic!&nbsp;</i>&rsquo;s&nbsp;<i>High Hopes&nbsp;</i>for the first\nsong and&nbsp;<i>Last Christmas&nbsp;</i>for the second and as always, they had\nbeen quite fast with their work. They were practiced and basically done on\nMonday, so they allowed themselves the night off. Phil&rsquo;s brother was in town\nand Dan had&nbsp;<i>heartlessly neglected&nbsp;</i>Tyler since the assignment\nstarted (his words), basically forcing Dan to spent the night with him.</p><p>Fortunately\nTyler had a lecture early the next morning, so he wasn&rsquo;t trying to get himself\nor Dan trashed. He did, however, made use of the time by grilling Dan about his\nrelationship to Phil.</p><p>Dan was a\nbit annoyed, but at the end of the day he was glad to be able to talk about it,\neven if he would never admit to that. Louise and her group were still in the\nrun for the finals too, which made her so busy they barely were able to talk\nfor longer than a few minutes at a time - and he desperately needed an\noutsider&rsquo;s opinion.</p><p>It took him\nalmost an hour to get Tyler up to date on what had happened, all the while\ngetting interrupted by texts from Phil. Right when he was done explaining his\nphone dinged again, indicating another text.</p><p><i>&lsquo;the\ngirl two tables over has a cute lil pup on her lap i keep staring she probs\nthinks i&rsquo;m a perv help&rsquo;&nbsp;</i>it read and he couldn&rsquo;t help but chuckle. Tyler inspected him warily\nfrom across the table, absently playing with the straw in his half-empty\ncocktail. &ldquo;Okay, who are you texting?&rdquo; he asked then, fixing Dan with a steely\ngaze.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s\njust Phil,&rdquo; he answered distractedly, typing a quick response before turning\nhis attention back to Tyler. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you\nshitting me?&rdquo; he asked back, a fitting expression on his face like he couldn&rsquo;t\nbelieve what he was hearing. Dan just answered with a surprised &ldquo;huh?&rdquo;,\nshooting him a confused look.</p><p>&ldquo;Mate, how\ndense can you be? You are basically dating the guy, only without the good\nparts!&rdquo;</p><p>Dan\nblinked, completely lost now, unable to follow Tyler&rsquo;s train of thought.\n&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You and\nPhil are dating, Dan, wake up! The only thing missing is the sex!&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /><br />\nDan was stunned into silence, staring at Tyler like he had grown a second head.\nIt took the thought a while to register in his brain, but then he blushed,\ntaking a huge gulp of his drink before calling the waiter over to order another\none.</p><p>He needed\nmore alcohol for this.</p><p>~~~~</p><p>The show on\nwednesday evening went exceptionally well. They had the most fun rocking\nto&nbsp;<i>High Hopes&nbsp;</i>and got really festive during&nbsp;<i>Last\nChristmas&nbsp;</i>, with Dan at the Piano and Phil sat on top of it. Their\nprofessors called them over and into the next show immediately, making them\ngiddy and high on adrenaline in the process.</p><p>The\nchristmas party thrown by the rock music department started directly afterwards\nand PJ and Louise, immensely proud of their best friends even though their own\ngroup had been voted out, insisted on going. Still in an after show rush they\nagreed, but soon realized why they normally didn&rsquo;t like parties. It was loud,\nthe room stuffed with people and the food was average at best, and it took them\naround twenty minutes to revert back to the snacks table, where they hid from\nthe actual party.</p><p>When Louise,\nPJ and Tyler of all people found them, sporting a cheeky expression, Dan knew\nthey were fucked. They were leaning against a wall, talking and laughing with\neach other as much as the music allowed them to, and only a few people were\ninspecting them from afar.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you\nknow where you&rsquo;re standing?&rdquo; PJ asked when the group was within earshot and Dan\nraised an eyebrow. &ldquo;Next to the snacks table where we always are?&rdquo; he remarked\ndrily, making Phil chuckle next to him.</p><p>&ldquo;Look up!&rdquo;\nTyler singsonged with a high pitched voice and flattered his eyelashes with\nfaked innocence.</p><p>Dan perked\nup immediately. He knew that voice.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t\neven need to look up to know what was fixated on the wall over their heads.</p><p>&ldquo;A\nMistletoe!&rdquo; Louise grinned so widely Dan was sure it had to hurt. He turned his\nattention to Phil, his heart throbbing in his chest on full speed.</p><p>There was a\ncheeky smile on the guitarist&rsquo;s face as he took a step closer, taking a hold of\nDan&rsquo;s head with both hands. &ldquo;They want a kiss,&rdquo; he murmured, lowly, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s give\nthem a kiss.&rdquo;</p><p>The second\nhis lips met Phil&rsquo;s was like a firework going off everywhere inside of his\nbody. For a moment he forgot where he was, hell, even who he was, just\ncontinued kissing Phil with passion and lust and love. He didn&rsquo;t even hesitate\nopening up his mouth at Phil&rsquo;s silent request to let him in, too far gone to\ncare - hell, to even&nbsp;<i>realize&nbsp;</i>they had an audience.</p><p>The kiss\nlasted for minutes and it probably could have gone on much longer if there\nwouldn&rsquo;t have been a sudden outburst of applause. The blood took a second to\nreach Dan&rsquo;s brain after having rushed somewhere south only seconds ago, but\nwhen it did, it immediately spread into his cheeks. They broke apart, Dan&rsquo;s\nface still in Phil&rsquo;s hands, silently contemplating the recent event.</p><p>He had just\nkissed Phil Lester. In front of basically the whole rock music department.</p><p><i>Great.\nJust great.</i></p><p>The\napplause and whooping didn&rsquo;t stop soon and he couldn&rsquo;t do much more then to\nexchange a long look with Phil. They had a silent discussion Dan himself didn&rsquo;t\nknow the content of, until suddenly and with no indication there was panic on\nPhil&rsquo;s face as he hastily let go of Dan and scrambled to get his phone out of\nhis pocket. It was vibrating violently in his hands and Dan couldn&rsquo;t even blink\nby the time Phil rasped out a &ldquo;Shit! My brother is waiting for me!&rdquo; and left in\na rush.</p><p>Dan stood\nthere, staring after Phil until most of the students had averted their gazes\nfrom him and went back to whatever they had been doing before. When the ice in\nhis veins freezing him into place finally dissipated, he groaned. He knew\nPhil&rsquo;s brother Martyn was picking him up for Christmas with their family, and\nhe wouldn&rsquo;t be back until january.</p><p><i>Of\ncourse. That&rsquo;s just my fucking luck.</i></p><p>~~~</p><p>He spent\nchristmas break in some sort of limbo, like his relationship to Phil was\nSchr&ouml;dinger&rsquo;s cat, platonic and romantic at the same time. He knew the kiss had\nmeant something not only to him but also to Phil, that much had been obvious\nwith the way he had taken the offensive in deepening the kiss and how he had\nheld him afterwards. But that was about the amount of information Dan had, and\nneither of them mentioned the kiss on any level, so he decided to just ignore\nthe issue for now.</p><p>It did made\nhim jumpy and fidgety and mostly unable to focus, though, and only his frequent\nskype calls with Phil got him focused and concentrated enough to get some much\nneeded work done.</p><p>There were\nonly two shows left, but they were only one week apart and both required three\nsongs, so they decided to learn all songs over the break. They spent hours on\nskype, deciding on the songs and how to play and sing them, so they would be\ndone learning their personal parts until they could meet back up in person.</p><p>For a short\nmoment, their reunion was like the sun had risen again. They hugged, soft words\nof attachment and longing on their lips, but then it was like someone had\nflipped a switch and they were back in working mode. Phil didn&rsquo;t mention the\nkiss and Dan didn&rsquo;t dare to, so they went back to Status Quo, just like that.</p><p>The first\nshow in the new year went okay-ish. Neither of them poured everything into it,\nalready looking forward to the songs they had chosen for the finale, but they\nstill managed to pull through. Their only truly memorable performance was&nbsp;<i>The\nBlack Parade&nbsp;</i>by&nbsp;<i>My Chemical Romance&nbsp;</i>, which they\ndefinitely aced, but the other ones admittedly fell a bit flat. Both their\nprofessors urged them to not take it too lightly just because they had done so\namazingly until now, so they swore to give everything they had in their last\nperformances together.</p><p>They were\nthe first group performing in the finale. It wasn&rsquo;t hard for Dan to get in the\nmood of their songs, considering they were all pining lovesongs and he would\nhave the one he was pining after up on stage with him, so he was glad they got\nto go first. It made the waiting and anticipation in between easier, and\nwaiting for the results when they were done didn&rsquo;t mean much to him anyway - he\ndidn&rsquo;t care too much about winning.</p><p>He just\nwanted to give his best, pour all his feelings into the songs when he was up\nthere with Phil. He wanted to make it obvious that he meant every word he was\nsinging.</p><p>He wanted\nto get Phil to understand&hellip;</p><p>In short,\nhe just wanted Phil.</p><p>Their first\nsong was a soft piano interpretation of&nbsp;<i>It&rsquo;s not living (If it&rsquo;s not\nwith you)&nbsp;</i>by&nbsp;<i>The 1975&nbsp;</i>, and Dan was so entranced by\nPhil he forgot to look at his hands while playing. He didn&rsquo;t make a single\nmistake, thankfully, &nbsp;but if he would have made one he probably wouldn&rsquo;t\neven have noticed. He benefited from the fact that he had practiced the piano\npart so often on the tiny piano in his childhood bedroom that his parents had\nasked him to please,&nbsp;<i>please&nbsp;</i>stop.</p><p>They spent\ntheir break with a bottle of coke huddled together on a tiny sofa backstage,\nmaking loose conversation and trying to get their mind off of things. Dan\nbasked in the close physical proximity and simply smiled when Phil just\ncasually took his hand while he talked, playing with his fingers. He had a\nfeeling that things would be going well.</p><p>Dan had\nparticularly fun during their next song.&nbsp;<i>The Last Of The Real\nOnes&nbsp;</i>by&nbsp;<i>Fallout Boy&nbsp;</i>was one of his favorite songs and\nhe connected a lot of the lyrics to Phil. The piano playing was not an issue\nthis time since they had both laid down their playing previously and conjoined\nit in a track, so he had all the time in the world to focus on Phil, which he\ntook full advantage of. They riled up the crowd so much that Tyler, who had agreed\nto be the presenter of the night, had trouble getting them back in check for\nthe next group.</p><p>During\nchristmas break, far away from Phil and his feelings, their next song had\nseemed like a good idea. It was romantic, emotional and full of love and Dan\ncouldn&rsquo;t think of any other song that would make his feelings for Phil more\nclear than this.</p><p>Now,\nthough, it seemed entirely too personal to perform in front of what felt like\nthe whole Uni. During practice he had refrained from building too much of a\nconnection, afraid of taking it too far, but now he didn&rsquo;t have much of a\nchoice and it made him more nervous than any other performance before. His\nhands were sweaty, his stomach was rumbling and he was ready to cancel the\nwhole thing when Phil noticed the state he was in.</p><p>&ldquo;Dan,&rdquo; he\nwhispered, pointedly ignoring the other people lounging around backstage,\ncompletely focusing on Dan, &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be okay.&nbsp;<i>You&nbsp;</i>will be okay.\nAnd I will be with you, right there by your side the whole time, okay?&rdquo;</p><p>It was in\nthis moment that something settled in Dan&rsquo;s chest. He returned Phil&rsquo;s fond look\nwith courage and determination, grasping his hand in his and squeezing it\ntightly. &ldquo;Me too. We&rsquo;re on the same page.&rdquo;</p><p>He was sure\nPhil caught the double meaning when his look got soft. &ldquo;I think I always knew,&rdquo;\nhe answered quietly, almost inaudible. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do this.&rdquo;</p><p>~~~</p><p>Their last\nperformance of this assignment was a complete success. They performed&nbsp;<i>The\nOnly Exception&nbsp;</i>by&nbsp;<i>Paramore&nbsp;</i>sitting huddled together\non the little Piano stool in front of the huge piano and didn&rsquo;t take their eyes\noff of each other the entire time. It was so emotional Tyler had tears in his\neyes when he came on stage, hugging first Phil, then Dan tightly, muttering a\nsoft &ldquo;go get &lsquo;em, tiger&rdquo; into Dan&rsquo;s ear and Dan could feel his heart swelling.</p><p>This was\nit.</p><p>Backstage,\nthankfully, they were alone. Both of the other groups were nowhere to be seen,\nand Phil obviously noticed faster than him.</p><p>Before he\neven had the chance to turn around from closing the door he was already spun\naround and pressed against the next hard surface, Phil&rsquo;s lips attacking his\nown.</p><p>For what\nfelt like ages they were kissing furiously, like they had deprived themselves\nof this for far too long and now a dam had been broken down, nothing holding\nthem back anymore.</p><p>Once they\nwere out of breath Phil separated their lips, lovingly gazing into his eyes\ninstead. &ldquo;I have waited for this for far too long,&rdquo; he whispered quietly,\nsoftly, his hands on the sides of Dan&rsquo;s head, his thumbs gently caressing his\ncheeks.</p><p>&ldquo;Me too,&rdquo;\nhe mumbled back, drowning in Phil&rsquo;s eyes and feeling himself falling, falling;\nfalling even deeper in love with him. &ldquo;I meant every word I sang.&rdquo;</p><p>There was a\nbeat of quiet, then:</p><p>&ldquo;I love\nyou.&rdquo;</p><p>The words\nwere muttered completely simultaneously, and for the single bat of an eye both\nstared at the other, stunned into silence.</p><p>Then they\nwere both dissolving into giggles, holding onto the other to keep from toppling\nover.</p><p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo;\nPhil gasped out, &ldquo;was so us.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan\ncouldn&rsquo;t help but agree.</p><p>~~~</p><p>&ldquo;Do you\nreally think so, Badiha?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t\nknow, Henry, but they did seem smitten during that song, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;True!&rdquo;</p><p>There was a\ngroup of at least five people seated in the booth directly behind Dan&rsquo;s and\neven though he wasn&rsquo;t that much of a gossip he couldn&rsquo;t help but eavesdrop. He\nwas busily procrastinating the work he needed to do until the next day,\nrefreshing tumblr around ten times a minute, so it wasn&rsquo;t too surprising the\nconversation distracted him as soon as it got loud enough for him to hear.</p><p>&ldquo;But they\nhaven&rsquo;t been seen in public with each other in ages aside from their\nperformances. I just really want them to be happy with each other, is that too\nmuch to ask?&rdquo;</p><p>That was\nthe first voice again. Dan allowed himself a short look at the group out of the\ncorner of his eyes and recognized all faces he was able to pick up on. They had\nall been to the performance Phil and him did twice a week in a near bar ever\nsince their joint assignment last year, he was sure of it. He mostly recognized\nthem because of the person that had spoken first, a girl with the pride flag\ndrawn on her eyelids. He remembered how she had attracted his attention during\ntheir first show because of her truly iconic makeup.</p><p>&ldquo;I know,\nright?!&rdquo; a male voice joined in and this time Dan didn&rsquo;t need the information\npractically jumping into his face to realize they were talking about him and\nPhil.</p><p>After their\nwin in the finale they had decided to keep their relationship at a down low,\ntrying to make themselves comfortable with being boyfriends before they truly\nmade it public. They were still pretty famous throughout the students and the\ncenter of the rumor mill, but they had been in a relationship for almost a year\nnow and had only recently realized there was nothing to be afraid of if\neverybody knew. Most of them would be happy for them, and the rest of them,\nwell -</p><p>They&rsquo;d just\nhave to suck it up.</p><p>That was\nthe moment his boyfriend decided to show up. He slid into the booth, taking a\nseat directly next to Dan, pressing their thighs together. &ldquo;Morning, love,&rdquo; he\ngreeted Dan gently, planting a kiss on his cheek before grinning happily. &ldquo;Busy\nprocrastinating?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Dan\nreplied extra loud, grinning right back, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;d rather kiss my boyfriend.&rdquo;</p><p>So they\nshared a short, cute kiss, making the group behind them gasp loudly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s\nthem,&rdquo; the girl with the pride flag on her eyelids whispered into the silence\nstretching between them. Dan grinned.</p><p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; he\nconfirmed cheekily, turning around to look at her. &ldquo;Very iconic Make-up by the\nway, I like it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god,\nthank you,&rdquo; she answered, a blush becoming apparent on her cheeks and Dan&rsquo;s\ngrin only got wider before he turned his attention back around to Phil.</p><p>&ldquo;What was\nthat about?&rdquo; he asked with a raised eyebrow and his head cutely tilted to the\nside.</p><p>Dan pecked\nhim on the lips. &ldquo;Had to make a point.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil looked\nback cheekily, a grin on his face so wide Dan was able to see his tongue poking\nout between his teeth. &ldquo;A point about what?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan puffed\nout his cheeks, feigning huffiness. Phil knew&nbsp;<i>exactly&nbsp;</i>what\nthis was about, and they were both aware of that. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an idiot,&rdquo; he said,\npouting.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, but\nI&rsquo;m&nbsp;<i>your&nbsp;</i>idiot.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan looked\nat him, eyes full of fondness and adoration and love. &ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;</p>",
