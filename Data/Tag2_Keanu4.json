I\u2019ve had so much fun writing this mini series and I hope this final part lives up to your expectations. Once again, thank you for all your love and kind words, I see it all and appreciate every single one of you. I hope you all enjoy!!) </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cJohn, this is all so pretty! Look at the petal covered aisle, and oh my goodness, look at that chandelier back there. Do you think I\u2019ll ever be lucky enough to have a wedding as pretty as this?\u201d, Y/N asked, her hopeful eyes meeting his, oblivious to anyone else around her other than the man that stood beside her. Her question caught John off guard, thoughts kicking in of Y/N getting married one day, thoughts of how alluring she\u2019d look dressed in a pristine, white wedding dress, standing at that altar, meeting his own eyes\u2014\u201cearth to Wick? Do we have a copy? Helloooooo?\u201d, the figure beside him mimicked a radio voice as she waved her hand frantically in front of his face in attempts to bring him back down to the present. \u201cOH MY GOD, THERE\u2019S A PHOTOBOOTH, COME QUICK BEFORE ANYONE ELSE GETS IN THERE\u201d, she animatedly cried, making sure he trailed behind her as she awkwardly strode her way to the white booth with the dark curtain divide open, indicating no one else was in the booth. Practically shoving John inside the small booth, she hopped in herself after he sat down on the \u2018seat\u2019 that was attached to the metal shelling, taking up what little space there was to begin with. </p><p>\u201cEr, Y/N, is this a photobooth or a solitary confinement chamber painted to look like some sort of cute thing, because right now I\u2019m thinking the latter\u201d, he sarcastically said, watching as she stood in the middle of the booth trying to figure out how this would ever work. Swiping the black curtain cover closed, she turned to John and grinned. </p><p>\u201cGuess we\u2019ll just have to improve with the seating then\u201d. She quickly sat herself down on his lap, a small gasp being elicited from the man beneath her as her grin widened. Her soft, plush ass pressed into him, John felt his cheeks flush with the sheer contact of her against his most intimate parts. \u201cAre you kidding? $3? We have to pay $3 damn dollars for 2 strips of 4 tiny photos?\u201d, a frown graced her face reflecting the utter disgust she felt, making John laugh at how she was acting like some frugal old woman. Sliding his hand into the inner pocket of his blazer, he revealed his leather wallet, pulling out $3 and sliding the notes into the machine, listening to it whir as it hungrily accepted his money.</p><p>\u201cHappy now?\u201d He asked, receiving a response of rapid nodding and a cheery \u2018thank you\u2019, with the \u2018you\u2019 being elongated into a \u2018youuuu\u2019 along with a wide, toothy smile. Selecting the \u2018classic\u2019 option, they both readied themselves for the photos. The first photo consisted of them both making goofy faces, Y/N sticking her tongue out and John with his mouth open pretending to look shocked with his eyes wide. The next, both of them feigning \u2018cool\u2019 expressions, pouting as Y/N held up the Shaka sign and John made devil horns out of his hands. The third photo contained Y/N with her hands wrapped around John\u2019s neck and both of them naturally laughing at how silly they felt, capturing a moment of genuine happiness and in the final photo, Y/N brought her soft lips to his bearded cheek and gave it a loving kiss, John grinning from ear to ear before he could even react to it as the photo was taken, leaving his mouth agape after the final photo was snapped and making the girl sitting on his lap crack up with laughter at just how shook he looked. Hopping up and snapping the curtain open, she left the booth and waited outside for the photos to be printed whilst John sat there astonished and about 50% more into her\u2014 if that was even possible. </p><p>\u201cJohn, look! Look at how <i>cute</i> we are, oh my gosh aren\u2019t we so <i>adorable</i>? This needs to go in some modern art gallery or some shit\u201d. Handing John one copy of the photos, she popped her copy into her clutch and couldn\u2019t help but beam towards John, pure joy and love filling her heart and flowing through every vein and artery, metastasising its way all through her body. John stood for a moment, staring at the photos that he held in his hand, amazed at how easily this girl had made him fall for her. He wasn\u2019t sure how much longer he\u2019d be able to hide these feelings, utter fear building up inside him at the thought of having to let her go or even worse, her letting him go and not wanting anything to do with him. He couldn\u2019t remember a time when he felt so vulnerable apart from one time\u2014 when those dreaded words of \u2018I don\u2019t think this is working out\u2019 fell out of Helen\u2019s mouth like beads descending from a broken piece of string, the next word falling faster than the one before it. Clearing his head of the bad memory, he popped his photos into one his inner blazer pockets and returned his attention back to the delighted girl, concern breaching those starry eyes as if to ask \u2018are you okay?\u2019, which John gave a small nod along with a simple ghost of a smile. \u201cLet\u2019s go find our seats, we\u2019ve been standing far too long for my liking minus my seat consisting of your lap, especially in these heels goddamn it, <i>why</i> did I wear these, John?\u201d, she muttered with frustration, giving a small pout like a tired child would do.</p><p>\u201cWell, you thought they looked pretty and despite wearing them, you\u2019re still <i>shorter</i> than me, so\u2026\u201d, John replied, Y/N\u2019s mouth taking an \u2018O\u2019 shape of pretend offence, her hand on her heart and giving an exaggerated \u2018ouch\u2019, making the corners of John\u2019s mouth lift up. \u201cI\u2019m just kidding, it doesn\u2019t make you any less <i>beautiful</i> and most importantly, <i>any less Y/N</i>\u201d, he softly spoke, bringing his finger to the bottom of her chin and watching as her mouth returned to her normal, toothy smile. \u201cNow, let\u2019s go find ourselves some good seats before we get stuck having to sit next to a weirdo who has no respect for personal space\u201d, he said as Y/N linked her arm around his and they both made their way to the ceremony area.</p><p>More guests started to pile in, the area soon full to the brim of a diversity of people taking their seats and chatting joyfully. They both chose their seats between the back and the middle, sitting somewhere close to the end of the row for an easy exit if need be. They both sat close together, John\u2019s knees touching Y/N\u2019s, hands still entwined in a gesture of comfort and support, maybe something even more intimate. \u201cHey, John, remember when you said \u2018stuck sitting next to some weirdo who has no respect for personal space\u2019, I think you were secretly foreshadowing this\u201d, she said as she used her other hand and waved her finger between the two of them. </p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. I think I was hinting at <i>Phil</i> beside me\u201d, he replied with a slight groan, tilting his head to his right to show Y/N exactly what he was talking about. And he was right. The man sat beside him, albeit was much smaller compared to John (in more ways than one, she thought and tried to suppress a laugh from escaping), had no problem with manspreading his legs wider than need be, his leg pressed against John\u2019s as in some kind of territorial battle for leg space. </p><p>\u201cYou reckon he wants some of that leg action of yours, Jonathan? I don\u2019t blame him\u201d, she shrugged as John\u2019s breath caught at the back of his throat. \u201cExcuse me, sir, would you mind moving your leg away from my boyfriend\u2019s, he just had some surgery done on his poor, fractured femur and currently has a splint on that leg and any pressure such as your leg against his can be extremely painful, so if you would ever so <i>kindly</i> remove your leg from his, it would be really appreciated\u201d. The man looked at Y/N with a stony expression, opening his mouth to say blunt \u2018no\u2019, but before he could, John turned towards his direction and recognition hit the gross man like a runaway train. He\u2019d obviously recognised the infamous man staring him down right now, immediately closing his legs with a sheepish \u2018sorry\u2019 as his face turned a bright crimson. \u201cLiterally all you needed to do was look the man in the eyes and he closed his legs as if he was born a virgin again. You could\u2019ve saved me from all my waffling by just sending your intense gaze his way\u201d.</p><p>\u201cComes with the reputation, plus I enjoyed your waffling. Boyfriend who just had surgery done on his fractured femur but miraculously can walk perfectly?\u201d, he sniggered.</p><p>\u201cWell, considering all the shit you\u2019ve been through, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it actually did happen. Not like I\u2019d be able to tell let alone anyone else in this whole venue\u201d, she defended her decision, quickly adding, \u201cand yes, boyfriend\u201d, clearing her voice she said aloud, \u201cyes, everyone, here is my <i>loving</i>, ninja of a boyfriend, John Wick who I <i>adore</i> dearly with my whole heart\u201d. Some heads turned their direction as Y/N laid her head on his shoulder, taking the opportunity to breathe in the scent of John\u2019s cologne and also witness the work of her words on him, feeling the heat of his body rise against his neck as he whispered,</p><p>\u201cI thought you said you didn\u2019t want to \u2018steal the show at someone else\u2019s wedding\u2019?\u201d. </p><p>\u201cWhoopsie, my bad. Couldn\u2019t help it when I\u2019m here with <i>you</i>\u201d. Y/N knew she was playing a game that could go either one of two ways: she succeeds in conveying just how much she wanted John to herself through her animated confessions that she played off as jokes, or she\u2019d completely scare John away, detering him from ever wanting to be near her again let alone hear from her. \u201cJohn, listen, I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019ve made you feel uncomfortable. You just make me so fricking happy and I can\u2019t help but act like this whenever I\u2019m around you, even if it\u2019s at someone else\u2019s wedding. Please forgive me\u2014\u201d. Before she could even finish her sentence, John pressed his finger to his mouth, shushing her gently as he brought her hand to his mouth, pressing a light kiss to the back of it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re rambling again. You don\u2019t need to apologise for anything, Y/N, especially not for being you. I know you, and I know you\u2019re just excited and cheerful about being here. I\u2019d rather my normal Y/N than a fabricated Y/N pretending to be someone that she isn\u2019t\u201d. Y/N could feel emotions of affection bubbling inside her and just wanted to scream \u2018hey, I think I\u2019m falling in love with you, please feel the same way\u2019. </p><p>\u201c3 years later and you still manage to get me with those words of yours. You always know all the right things to say. Thank you, Jonathan\u201d. Before he could reply, everyone cheered as a man in a black and white tuxedo made his way down the aisle to the front, his brunette, pompadour hair impeccable, flashing his bright, white, bleached teeth towards all the faces around the room in a perfect smile. Y/N could feel the hand around hers tighten, bringing her free hand to rest on top of his clenching hand, tracing small pictures over the top of his hand to try and help him relax a bit. Turning her head, she could see how his jaw clenched and his smouldering eyes followed Matthew\u2019s every action. </p><p>A few minutes had passed since Matthew\u2019s entrance and John was getting increasingly uncomfortable, his leg jittering up and down in anticipation as if he was the one standing in Matthew\u2019s place awaiting Helen\u2019s arrival, wanting this whole thing to just be over and to just be alone with Y/N watching one of her Disney movies. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019ll be okay through this? We can always go back inside and have a drink or something\u201d, Y/N sincerely asked with worry laced in her voice. John just nodded, not wanting to speak worried that his voice would deceive his answer of \u2018yes, I\u2019ll be okay\u2019.</p><p>Soon after, all the bridesmaids and flower girls started walking down the aisle, soft music playing as the girls dressed in ros\u00e8 coloured dresses made their way down the white flooring. Once they had all reached the front, the orchestra had begun to play a gentle piece of music, indicating that the bride was next, everyone moving to stand, patiently awaiting her arrival. There Helen was, bound in an ivory, A-line wedding gown looking as beautiful as ever. Little details of embroidery diffused its way down the dress, crystals stitched on little areas of the gown and around the waist followed by a brush train trailing behind her. Her brown hair was pulled back and up into a bun with a crowned veil attached to the back. \u201cShe\u2019s so gorgeous\u201d, Y/N whispered to herself rather than anyone else, astounded by her beauty. The area was filled with sounds of camera shutters clicking, the whisperings of people in awe of such utter beauty and the harmony of the orchestra. </p><p>John stood and watched on as the previous love of his life walked down the aisle to marry a man that wasn\u2019t him. She still looked as beautiful as she did the first day he laid his eyes on her, her brown eyes still as kind as ever, the same smile gracing her smile, defining those rosy cheeks of hers. As Helen looked around the area, her eyes fell on John\u2019s, both of their breaths hitching in their throats making it seem like they were the only two people present at that time. Her eyes flickered to the stunning girl on his side, her mauve dress making her stand out among the rest of the crowd who stuck with the bright, pastel colours of beige and light greys. The girl looked at her with inspired eyes, eyes that reflected her pureness, helping Helen coming to the conclusion that she can\u2019t have been any older than 25, her eyes hadn\u2019t seen much in life for long to still have that glow of hope in them. The girl was smiling towards her, not a plastic smile or a malicious one, but a real, tender smile. Helen couldn\u2019t help but return the smile, a mellow feeling replacing her previous melancholic one as she gave John a final glance along with her smile, to convey that there were no hard feelings before she diverted her attention back to the man she now loved\u2014Matthew.</p><p>Relief flooded John once he and Y/N were sent that smile, quietening his mind for a little. \u201cShe seems really nice, I like her\u201d, Y/N added making John release a breathy laugh. </p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019m glad that you like my ex, that\u2019s always good to know\u201d. They watched on as Helen met Matthew at the front, both of their smiles never faltering as they did so. They both did their vows, and while John stiffened at hearing the words \u2018I do\u2019 come out of Helen\u2019s mouth, he relaxed soon after he looked down at the angel sat beside him, allowing himself to finally begin to let Helen go for sure this time. Everyone got up on their feet and cheered as the now happily married couple made their way down the aisle and into the reception area, the guests soon followed after them. Once most people had cleared the area, Y/N twirled around to meet John again, her pride for John beaming off of her without her even needing to say a word. She threw her hands around his neck and brought him in for a soothing hug, John returning the hug just as fast as they stood there for a little just like that, revelling in each other\u2019s embrace. </p><p>Parting from one another, they walked hand in hand to the reception area, Y/N grabbing two champagne flutes filled with the golden, sparkling beverage and handing one to John. \u201cI know, I know, \u2018<i>ugh, why do you drink this stuff Y/N, what\u2019s wrong with you, I brood and only drink expensive, aged whiskey neats</i>\u2019 but it\u2019s free and I think we both need to loosen up after this.\u201d.</p><p>\u201cI agree with everything but the \u2018<i>i brood and only drink expensive, aged whiskey</i>\u2019\u201d John replied, raising his glass as Y/N mimicked the same with a \u2018<i>skol</i>\u2019 as they sipped the golden bubbly, lifting their faces to give the exact same reaction of revulsion, making Y/N burst out laughing as John chuckled along with her, drawing the attention of the people around them but they couldn\u2019t care less. </p><p>\u201cWe are such annoying guests, no one should invite us anywhere together. And if they do, we\u2019d need some sort of restraining order from each other\u201d, Y/N sniggered as she turned to look at all the disapproving faces. </p><p>\u201cBut where would be the fun in that, hm?\u201d, leaning closer, he whispered, \u201cI think an assassin and a princess make a pretty good duo, but hey, that\u2019s just my opinion\u201d. The feeling of his hot breath against her ear made a shiver run down her spine, feeling a familiar knot in her stomach tighten at the thought of him whispering other things in her ear in a much different context. Noticing the change in her posture, John added, \u201cwhat\u2019s going on in that beautiful mind of yours, <i>princess</i>?\u201d. As if on cue, a waiter walked by with a tray full of flutes of champagne and Y/N grabbed another, downing her first one quickly and then downing this one straight after, giving her the <i>much</i> needed confidence boost to deal with the devil in disguise next to her. Before she could reply, again as if on cue, the newly wed couple made their grand entrance as everyone cheered and jeered as Matthew clasped his hands together giving a \u2018champion\u2019 pose, Helen close beside him laughing at his childishness. </p><p>Y/N could feel her empty stomach cry out for food, the bubbly probably not helping the case of keeping the rumbling of her stomach quiet. \u201cCan we just eat already?\u201d, she mumbled to herself, quiet enough that only she and John would be able to hear her. </p><p>\u201cDinner will be soon. We just need to listen through these speeches and their first dance then we can grab something to eat, does that sound achievable or is that too much to ask for <i>princess</i>?\u201d, John asked sympathetically, though a tone of mischief came through as well, Y/N instantly regretting telling him the idea of her being a princess, but secretly it was doing things to her. Gulping, she nodded as she felt the knot in her stomach tighten even more out of hunger for the handsome man that had been driving her crazy the past three years, especially now rather than for food at that moment in time. </p><p>Several sentimental and cheesy speeches later, it finally came to the couple\u2019s first dance. Everyone watched as both of them in an interactional dance, effortlessly reciprocating one another\u2019s movement and gliding through the dance floor, slowing down as the song reduced in tempo as Helen rest her head against Matthew\u2019s shoulder as the song came to an end and the crowd burst into an encore. They then announced that it was time for dinner, and Y/N\u2019s face lit up at the sound of the word \u2018dinner\u2019. </p><p>\u2014</p><p>After dinner, Y/N excused herself to the bathroom to freshen up. She looked at herself in the mirror with the same smile she had on back at home, thinking that maybe this smile would never come off of her face ever again. She took a much needed toilet break to empty her bladder before fixing any loose pieces of hair that were out of place along with her lipstick, spritzing her face with a refresher mist and once happy with everything, left to go look for John. On her way to do so, she grabbed <i>another</i> glass of champagne, gulping the whole thing down in one again as she could feel the alcohol start to course through her blood to liven her up a little, but not enough to make her tipsy or drunk which was the last thing she\u2019d want to do here. As she glanced around the room, a man approached her. He was shorter than John and had a head of black hair along with striking blue eyes, a peppered beard and was clad in a navy blue suit. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a girl like you doing here all by yourself?\u201d, he asked, the stench of alcohol present in his breath as he spoke and that\u2019s when Y/N realised how close he was to her. </p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m not by myself. I\u2019m looking for my boyfriend\u201d, she politely replied. She was never one to be rude even in situations like this. \u201cLook, I\u2019ve found him!\u201d, she exclaimed as the man turned his head to look at who exactly she was talking about before he froze and instantly left. Y/N mentally thanked John for his intimidating self for saving her yet again. John wasn\u2019t alone, however. He was sat around a table, an older man who she recognised as the man that walked Helen down the aisle, along with several other men in tuxedos who she assumed to be part of Matthew\u2019s family. John wore that smouldering gaze again, jaw clenched as he sat up straight, a behaviour he displayed when he got defensive, professionally that is. She guessed they were grilling him about his life currently, post-Helen. Y/N worked quickly to make her way to him, taking long, confident strides towards him, though his back was towards her from this angle. </p><p>She got closer, her heels loud enough to give John a heads up that it was her and not someone sneaking up on him. She bent down, wrapping her arms around him in a soft embrace as part of her \u2018<i>mission: save John</i>\u2019, pressing a small kiss against his cheek. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I was gone so long, <i>sweetie</i>. I got lost on my way there and then I got a phone call from Will, you know the one from project management about the recent research conducted out on the Ligand binding assay and he just kept waffling, bless him\u2014oh my gosh, I\u2019m so sorry for interrupting! Where are my manners? Hi, I\u2019m Y/N, <i>John\u2019s girlfriend</i>. So nice to meet you all\u201d. They all sat with their eyes practically bulging out of their sockets, mouths agape but Y/N wasn\u2019t sure whether it was her waffling about some weird pharma model or if she\u2019d just grown an extra head. </p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s okay, <i>love</i>. Me and the guys here were just having a friendly conversation on just how lucky I\u2019ve been to have such a <i>wonderful</i> woman like you in my life. I hope everything\u2019s okay with Will?\u201d, John replied back, going along with the act you started. </p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s fine with Will, he just wanted to clarify some details with me about our next research project. And, stop it you. <i><b>I\u2019m</b></i> the lucky one, Jonathan Wick. You best have played nice with the <i>boys</i> here\u201d, she said, applying some emphasis on the word \u2018boys\u2019 as she turned to look at the other faces surrounding the table, letting her hands roam John\u2019s chest as she lightly padded her fingers across his stiff torso. \u201cI\u2019d hate to do this, but I need to borrow my dear, John here. You take care of yourselves, boys.\u201d, she finished a John bid them all a \u2018good evening\u2019 as he got up from the table, and much to Y/N\u2019s surprise, wrapped his arm around her waist. Y/N made sure to swing her hips a little as she strutted away from them, a grin plastered to her face as people moved out of their way, parting like Noah and the Red Sea. \u201cYou were right, a princess and an assassin do make a great duo\u201d. </p><p>\u201cOr maybe it\u2019s just us\u201d, he murmured back, feeling the effect of Y/N dig into his soul, clouding any other thought apart from her hands roaming his chest. \u201cThanks for saving me back there, those assholes wouldn\u2019t drop the whole \u2018<i>so tell us how shit your life is now without Helen</i>\u2019, not in those exact words but close enough\u201d. </p><p>\u201cIt was worth it to see all their dumb faces so shook. They need to do something better with their lives asap\u201d. </p><p>They were close approaching the dance floor, and a familiar midtempo love ballad that Y/N knew all too well began to play. Grabbing his hand, she tugged him towards the dance floor. \u201cCan we have this one dance, please? This is one of my favourite songs ever\u201d, she quietly asked, wide eyes staring up at him with such adoration that he couldn\u2019t say no. Wrapping his arms around her waist, she did the same with hers wrapping around his neck, bringing his head down closer to hers. Y/N softly sang the words to the song into his ear, \u201c<i>I\u2019ll trade your broken wings for mine, I\u2019ve seen your scars and kissed your crimes</i>\u201d, John immediately relaxed into her, her soft voice along with the lyrics and beautiful taking a toll. \u201c<i>Sweet love all night long, all I wanna, ain\u2019t no other, we together, I remember, sweet love all night long</i>\u201d. Y/N moved her face from his shoulder, making John gaze into her heavenly eyes again as she sang, \u201c<i>they say true love\u2019s the greatest weapon, to win the war caused by pain, but every diamond has imperfections, but my love\u2019s too pure to watch it chip away</i>\u201d. </p><p>Y/N could feel her eyes build with water, her feelings towards John too overwhelming to push away any longer. John felt it too, the ache of his heart longing to have Y/N. They both couldn\u2019t do it anymore. The song was nearing its end, and John whispered, \u201cif you don\u2019t want this, then move away now\u201d. When he saw her still standing there, he made his move. He slowly leaned in, close enough to feel her breath against his mouth before Y/N finally closed the gap between them. The kiss was passionate and had no rush to it, both of them savouring the taste of each other. They had both waited <i>three</i> years for this to happen, and here it was. And boy, did it feel <i>good</i>. Their mouths moved in sync with one another before Y/N had to move away and gasp for oxygen . The song came to a gentle stop as another started playing, eyes were glued to John and Y/N staring in wonder at the moment they\u2019d just shared. They hadn\u2019t noticed Helen\u2019s eyes on them too, watching on as warmth filled her heart to see John finally with someone that made him feel as though the sun was something built for him in a tool shed. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve waited three damn years for that, Wick, and it was so <i>damn</i> worth it.\u201d, Y/N admitted, as she brought her fingers up to his lips to wipe her lipstick off of them.</p><p>\u201cI know, because so have I\u201d. Y/N released a big yawn, the food, slow music and waking up at 5am aiding her into a tired state. \u201cSomeone looks tired. Come on, let\u2019s go home\u201d. Y/N attempted to argue against him but then thoughts of better things happening outside of this place goaded her into agreeing with him and letting him win the battle of whether to stay or leave. John retrieved his car from the valet, opening the door one last time for Y/N to hop in as he did the same. Y/N undid her heels and slid them off her sore feet, sighing in relief at the feeling no longer having her feet encaged in a torture machine.</p><p>They both drove in a blissful silence, quiet music filling the atmosphere, creating a safe space for the both of them. The clear roads meant that they arrived back at Y/N\u2019s place faster than it would\u2019ve usually taken. </p><p>\u201cI really enjoyed today, thank you for bringing me as your plus one and allowing me to live my guilty pleasure of being a princess for one day in my life, Prince Charming\u201d </p><p>\u201cIf I had known today would\u2019ve gone the way it did, I would\u2019ve never contemplated not going. Thank you for coming with me, I don\u2019t know how I would have survived the day without your presence\u201d. Y/N looked hesitantly at him, worried if her next words would make or break their current relationship for good but she had to try. </p><p>\u201cJohn, I\u2019ve been meaning to tell you something for a really long time now but I never knew if you\u2019d feel the same way so I never did because I didn\u2019t want to lose you.\u201d, she started as John listened intently to her words, his brow slightly furrowed. \u201c<i>I really like you</i>, John Wick. I\u2019ve liked you for a really long time now and I\u2019ve been bursting at the seams to tell y\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>I really like you too</i>, Y/N. Fuck, you\u2019ve been <i>driving me up a wall</i> since the first day we properly met. And your hijinks today? Sitting on my lap in the photobooth? Kissing my cheek? All the suggestive things you said? Calling me your boyfriend the whole day? Rubbing your hands up and down my chest? And don\u2019t think I didn\u2019t notice the way you swayed those fucking <i>gorgeous</i> hips.\u201d. \u2018So he did notice all these little things\u2019, she thought to herself, feeling her pride build up as that knot in her stomach returned. Y/N undid her seatbelt and climbed over quickly, but carefully, to John\u2019s seat, straddling his lap. </p><p>\u201cI <i>need</i> you so badly, John\u201d, she said in a hushed tone as she sat herself down on his lap, her burning hot core against his clothed member, John\u2019s eyes beginning to cloud with the same lust that filled Y/N\u2019s eyes. </p><p>\u201cTell me what you want me to do to you\u201d, John\u2019s voice rumbled in a low tone, a tone he\u2019d only ever used when out on his \u2018business ventures\u2019 but it made the sweet girl on his lap even wetter, feeling a wet spot forming over the crotch of his trousers from it soaking through her panties. </p><p>\u201cI want you to fuck me. I <i>need</i> you to <i>fuck</i> me. I <i>need</i> to feel you inside of me, please John, <i>please fuck me</i>\u201d, she moaned, looking at him with pleading eyes, instantly making John hard against her. Pulling the straps of her dress down, she revealed the blue bra she chose to wear in case this did happen. Unfastening her bra, she threw it over to the passenger seat as John responded with a low moan at the sight of her beautiful breasts. </p><p>Reaching out, the calloused padding of his hands cupped her perfect, smooth breasts, fondling them with extra care as Y/N bit her lip to prevent a moan from escaping her mouth. He moved his fingers to her hardened nipples and used his index finger and thumb to gently roll the peaks between them, tugging slightly at them as he watched the girl in front of him become undone. Leaning forward, he brought his lips to her breasts, covering them each in small, subtle kisses and then moving his attention back to her nipples again, running his tongue up against them, the air now hitting her peaks becoming cold, making Y/N delve in the sensitivity it brought about. Sensing that the cold air was increasing her sensitivity, John purposely blew air from out of his mouth against her stiffened peaks. \u201cDoes that feel good, <i>princess</i>?\u201d, the man beneath her asked, Y/N\u2019s heart fluttering at the pet name he adopted for her. Nodding furiously, she tried to reply with a \u2018yes\u2019 until the \u2018yes\u2019 stretched out into a melodious moan. Y/N dug her hips against his, savouring the friction caused by the layers of fabric between them, moving her hips back and forth over his hard on, producing a gruff moan elicited by the boogeyman himself. </p><p>\u201cOh, John, please I-I can\u2019t\u2014I need you inside me. <i>Please</i>.\u201d, her begs filled the space within the car. </p><p>\u201cY/N, wait. Are you sure you want this?\u201d, bringing his fingers to her chin, making her look into his lovesick, chocolate eyes. \u201cI need to hear it from you one last time\u201d. Moving her face closer to his, mere <i>centimetres</i> away from touching his lips, she whispered the words \u2018<i>I want this, John.</i> I\u2019m sure\u2019. And with that, John worked quick to unbuckle his belt, \u201cI just need you to lift yourself up a little so I can get these pants down, be careful, wouldn\u2019t want my princess to hit her poor head against the roof of the car. If we\u2019re going to do this, I need you awake, unless you\u2019re into that sort of thing\u201d, the last bit making Y/N giggle.</p><p>\u201cYou know me so well, and the worst part is even with your little warning about hitting my head against the roof of the car, I\u2019d <i>still</i> do it\u201d, lifting herself up slightly, enough for John to shuffle his clothing down and freeing his member. Y/N\u2019s eyes immediately glued to the throbbing, hard length in front of her eyes. The tip was leaking precum and the veins were prominent, a large one on the underside of his thick length. Without hesitation, she leaned forward moving her dress out the way by lifting it and bundling it around her waist, sliding her soaked panties to the side and pressing her hands against his shoulders as support as she lowered herself down onto his large cock. </p><p>John hissed as he felt his cock being embraced by tight, wet walls clenching down on him, the beautiful girl in front of him gasping with her mouth wide open, averting his gaze from her and down to where her eyes were fastened to, moaning as they watched his cock <i>disappear</i> deep inside of her tight hole. There was something so intimate about watching the way she bounced up and down, the way her mouth was ajar, prompting the symphony of moans and gasps and cries to slide past those flawless, plump lips. John could practically see the ripples of pleasure wave through her, passing like electrical current within a parallel circuit, pleasure reaching every inch of her deprived body. </p><p>\u201cFuck\u2014Y/N you feel so fucking good. You\u2019re fucking me so well, <i>princess</i>\u201d, praising her through gritted teeth, he moved one of his hands down to her clit, beginning to rub little circles over it, causing Y/N to squeal, the overwhelming pleasure causing her body to buck into John\u2019s, making her rest her head against the junction between his neck and shoulder, mewling into his ear provoking John to fuck up into her, gripping her hips harshly. </p><p>\u201cOh god, John\u201d, she breathed, lifting her face to look him in the eyes with her own E/C ones that had started to brim with tears as the need for release became too much. The windows of the car had long steamed up, shielding others from the sin that they were currently indulging in. John was hitting her g spot, over and over as he thrust his hips up against her, rewarded with a whine in return of his action. \u201cPlease\u2026 <i>please</i> John, I can\u2019t hold it for much longer, please let me cum\u201d. </p><p>Also nearing his own orgasm, John dug his fingers further into the plush flesh around her hips, making sure they\u2019d leave bruises for her to wake up to the next day, his thrusts becoming sloppier and more lax and his breathing ragged and increasingly desperate. \u201cYeah\u2026 come on <i>princess</i>, cum for me. Cum all over my cock, do it sweetheart\u201d, he instructed as he tried coaxing her orgasm out, feeling her tremble as she teetered over the edge, finally reaching sweet release with a cry, letting her head roll onto his shoulders as she fell apart in his lap. John delved in the feeling of her tight pussy clenching around him, ushering him to reach his own climax with one final thrust, exploding deep inside of her with a deep growl, holding her hips down in place so all of him was buried inside her. Heavy breathing filled the car, along with the whimpers that fell from Y/N\u2019s throat, triggering John to move his hands to her back, gently rubbing circles against it to aid her in coming down from her high. </p><p>A few moments had passed, both of them sat in the same position as their senses slowly returned to them as John was still buried inside Y/N, a thin sheen of sweat covering the both of them. Giving it all her energy, she lift her head up, meeting John\u2019s eyes as she rest her forehead against his. \u201c<i>Wow</i>\u201d, he murmured as that all too familiar smile of hers returned on her face.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019ve waited three years for this and it finally happened, albeit in your car, but it still happened\u201d. Now it was John\u2019s turn to smile as he leaned in and kissed her one final time. Sliding herself off of him, she slid her panties back over her core, honestly not minding that her favourite set had been ruined with their filth as she grabbed her bra from her seat, moving it so she could sit herself back and off of John\u2019s lap, much to her internal conflict against doing so. She didn\u2019t even bother putting the bra back on, simply placing it on her lap as John pulled his trousers back up and buckled his belt up again. \u201cThank you for such a wonderful day, Jonathan. I think this has probably taken the top spot for the best day of my life\u201d.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you for coming with me today. Thank you for agreeing to be my plus one and making this the best day of <i>my</i> life.\u201d, John replied as he brought her hand to his mouth a placed a loving kiss against her knuckles. </p><p><b>\u201cWe really do make a pretty good badass princess-assassin duo, hm?\u201d.</b></p>",

Look at the petal covered aisle, and oh my goodness, look at that chandelier back there. Do you think I\u2019ll ever be lucky enough to have a wedding as pretty as this?\u201d, Y/N asked, her hopeful eyes meeting his, oblivious to anyone else around her other than the man that stood beside her. Her question caught John off guard, thoughts kicking in of Y/N getting married one day, thoughts of how alluring she\u2019d look dressed in a pristine, white wedding dress, standing at that altar, meeting his own eyes\u2014\u201cearth to Wick? Do we have a copy? Helloooooo?\u201d, the figure beside him mimicked a radio voice as she waved her hand frantically in front of his face in attempts to bring him back down to the present. \u201cOH MY GOD, THERE\u2019S A PHOTOBOOTH, COME QUICK BEFORE ANYONE ELSE GETS IN THERE\u201d, she animatedly cried, making sure he trailed behind her as she awkwardly strode her way to the white booth with the dark curtain divide open, indicating no one else was in the booth. Practically shoving John inside the small booth, she hopped in herself after he sat down on the \u2018seat\u2019 that was attached to the metal shelling, taking up what little space there was to begin with. </p><p>\u201cEr, Y/N, is this a photobooth or a solitary confinement chamber painted to look like some sort of cute thing, because right now I\u2019m thinking the latter\u201d, he sarcastically said, watching as she stood in the middle of the booth trying to figure out how this would ever work. Swiping the black curtain cover closed, she turned to John and grinned. </p><p>\u201cGuess we\u2019ll just have to improve with the seating then\u201d. She quickly sat herself down on his lap, a small gasp being elicited from the man beneath her as her grin widened. Her soft, plush ass pressed into him, John felt his cheeks flush with the sheer contact of her against his most intimate parts. \u201cAre you kidding? $3? We have to pay $3 damn dollars for 2 strips of 4 tiny photos?\u201d, a frown graced her face reflecting the utter disgust she felt, making John laugh at how she was acting like some frugal old woman. Sliding his hand into the inner pocket of his blazer, he revealed his leather wallet, pulling out $3 and sliding the notes into the machine, listening to it whir as it hungrily accepted his money.</p><p>\u201cHappy now?\u201d He asked, receiving a response of rapid nodding and a cheery \u2018thank you\u2019, with the \u2018you\u2019 being elongated into a \u2018youuuu\u2019 along with a wide, toothy smile. Selecting the \u2018classic\u2019 option, they both readied themselves for the photos. The first photo consisted of them both making goofy faces, Y/N sticking her tongue out and John with his mouth open pretending to look shocked with his eyes wide. The next, both of them feigning \u2018cool\u2019 expressions, pouting as Y/N held up the Shaka sign and John made devil horns out of his hands. The third photo contained Y/N with her hands wrapped around John\u2019s neck and both of them naturally laughing at how silly they felt, capturing a moment of genuine happiness and in the final photo, Y/N brought her soft lips to his bearded cheek and gave it a loving kiss, John grinning from ear to ear before he could even react to it as the photo was taken, leaving his mouth agape after the final photo was snapped and making the girl sitting on his lap crack up with laughter at just how shook he looked. Hopping up and snapping the curtain open, she left the booth and waited outside for the photos to be printed whilst John sat there astonished and about 50% more into her\u2014 if that was even possible. </p><p>\u201cJohn, look! Look at how <i>cute</i> we are, oh my gosh aren\u2019t we so <i>adorable</i>? This needs to go in some modern art gallery or some shit\u201d. Handing John one copy of the photos, she popped her copy into her clutch and couldn\u2019t help but beam towards John, pure joy and love filling her heart and flowing through every vein and artery, metastasising its way all through her body. John stood for a moment, staring at the photos that he held in his hand, amazed at how easily this girl had made him fall for her. He wasn\u2019t sure how much longer he\u2019d be able to hide these feelings, utter fear building up inside him at the thought of having to let her go or even worse, her letting him go and not wanting anything to do with him. He couldn\u2019t remember a time when he felt so vulnerable apart from one time\u2014 when those dreaded words of \u2018I don\u2019t think this is working out\u2019 fell out of Helen\u2019s mouth like beads descending from a broken piece of string, the next word falling faster than the one before it. Clearing his head of the bad memory, he popped his photos into one his inner blazer pockets and returned his attention back to the delighted girl, concern breaching those starry eyes as if to ask \u2018are you okay?\u2019, which John gave a small nod along with a simple ghost of a smile. \u201cLet\u2019s go find our seats, we\u2019ve been standing far too long for my liking minus my seat consisting of your lap, especially in these heels goddamn it, <i>why</i> did I wear these, John?\u201d, she muttered with frustration, giving a small pout like a tired child would do.</p><p>\u201cWell, you thought they looked pretty and despite wearing them, you\u2019re still <i>shorter</i> than me, so\u2026\u201d, John replied, Y/N\u2019s mouth taking an \u2018O\u2019 shape of pretend offence, her hand on her heart and giving an exaggerated \u2018ouch\u2019, making the corners of John\u2019s mouth lift up. \u201cI\u2019m just kidding, it doesn\u2019t make you any less <i>beautiful</i> and most importantly, <i>any less Y/N</i>\u201d, he softly spoke, bringing his finger to the bottom of her chin and watching as her mouth returned to her normal, toothy smile. \u201cNow, let\u2019s go find ourselves some good seats before we get stuck having to sit next to a weirdo who has no respect for personal space\u201d, he said as Y/N linked her arm around his and they both made their way to the ceremony area.</p><p>More guests started to pile in, the area soon full to the brim of a diversity of people taking their seats and chatting joyfully. They both chose their seats between the back and the middle, sitting somewhere close to the end of the row for an easy exit if need be. They both sat close together, John\u2019s knees touching Y/N\u2019s, hands still entwined in a gesture of comfort and support, maybe something even more intimate. \u201cHey, John, remember when you said \u2018stuck sitting next to some weirdo who has no respect for personal space\u2019, I think you were secretly foreshadowing this\u201d, she said as she used her other hand and waved her finger between the two of them. </p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. I think I was hinting at <i>Phil</i> beside me\u201d, he replied with a slight groan, tilting his head to his right to show Y/N exactly what he was talking about. And he was right. The man sat beside him, albeit was much smaller compared to John (in more ways than one, she thought and tried to suppress a laugh from escaping), had no problem with manspreading his legs wider than need be, his leg pressed against John\u2019s as in some kind of territorial battle for leg space. </p><p>\u201cYou reckon he wants some of that leg action of yours, Jonathan? I don\u2019t blame him\u201d, she shrugged as John\u2019s breath caught at the back of his throat. \u201cExcuse me, sir, would you mind moving your leg away from my boyfriend\u2019s, he just had some surgery done on his poor, fractured femur and currently has a splint on that leg and any pressure such as your leg against his can be extremely painful, so if you would ever so <i>kindly</i> remove your leg from his, it would be really appreciated\u201d. The man looked at Y/N with a stony expression, opening his mouth to say blunt \u2018no\u2019, but before he could, John turned towards his direction and recognition hit the gross man like a runaway train. He\u2019d obviously recognised the infamous man staring him down right now, immediately closing his legs with a sheepish \u2018sorry\u2019 as his face turned a bright crimson. \u201cLiterally all you needed to do was look the man in the eyes and he closed his legs as if he was born a virgin again. You could\u2019ve saved me from all my waffling by just sending your intense gaze his way\u201d.</p><p>\u201cComes with the reputation, plus I enjoyed your waffling. Boyfriend who just had surgery done on his fractured femur but miraculously can walk perfectly?\u201d, he sniggered.</p><p>\u201cWell, considering all the shit you\u2019ve been through, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it actually did happen. Not like I\u2019d be able to tell let alone anyone else in this whole venue\u201d, she defended her decision, quickly adding, \u201cand yes, boyfriend\u201d, clearing her voice she said aloud, \u201cyes, everyone, here is my <i>loving</i>, ninja of a boyfriend, John Wick who I <i>adore</i> dearly with my whole heart\u201d. Some heads turned their direction as Y/N laid her head on his shoulder, taking the opportunity to breathe in the scent of John\u2019s cologne and also witness the work of her words on him, feeling the heat of his body rise against his neck as he whispered,</p><p>\u201cI thought you said you didn\u2019t want to \u2018steal the show at someone else\u2019s wedding\u2019?\u201d. </p><p>\u201cWhoopsie, my bad. Couldn\u2019t help it when I\u2019m here with <i>you</i>\u201d. Y/N knew she was playing a game that could go either one of two ways: she succeeds in conveying just how much she wanted John to herself through her animated confessions that she played off as jokes, or she\u2019d completely scare John away, detering him from ever wanting to be near her again let alone hear from her. \u201cJohn, listen, I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019ve made you feel uncomfortable. You just make me so fricking happy and I can\u2019t help but act like this whenever I\u2019m around you, even if it\u2019s at someone else\u2019s wedding. Please forgive me\u2014\u201d. Before she could even finish her sentence, John pressed his finger to his mouth, shushing her gently as he brought her hand to his mouth, pressing a light kiss to the back of it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re rambling again. You don\u2019t need to apologise for anything, Y/N, especially not for being you. I know you, and I know you\u2019re just excited and cheerful about being here. I\u2019d rather my normal Y/N than a fabricated Y/N pretending to be someone that she isn\u2019t\u201d. Y/N could feel emotions of affection bubbling inside her and just wanted to scream \u2018hey, I think I\u2019m falling in love with you, please feel the same way\u2019. </p><p>\u201c3 years later and you still manage to get me with those words of yours. You always know all the right things to say. Thank you, Jonathan\u201d. Before he could reply, everyone cheered as a man in a black and white tuxedo made his way down the aisle to the front, his brunette, pompadour hair impeccable, flashing his bright, white, bleached teeth towards all the faces around the room in a perfect smile. Y/N could feel the hand around hers tighten, bringing her free hand to rest on top of his clenching hand, tracing small pictures over the top of his hand to try and help him relax a bit. Turning her head, she could see how his jaw clenched and his smouldering eyes followed Matthew\u2019s every action. </p><p>A few minutes had passed since Matthew\u2019s entrance and John was getting increasingly uncomfortable, his leg jittering up and down in anticipation as if he was the one standing in Matthew\u2019s place awaiting Helen\u2019s arrival, wanting this whole thing to just be over and to just be alone with Y/N watching one of her Disney movies. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019ll be okay through this? We can always go back inside and have a drink or something\u201d, Y/N sincerely asked with worry laced in her voice. John just nodded, not wanting to speak worried that his voice would deceive his answer of \u2018yes, I\u2019ll be okay\u2019.</p><p>Soon after, all the bridesmaids and flower girls started walking down the aisle, soft music playing as the girls dressed in ros\u00e8 coloured dresses made their way down the white flooring. Once they had all reached the front, the orchestra had begun to play a gentle piece of music, indicating that the bride was next, everyone moving to stand, patiently awaiting her arrival. There Helen was, bound in an ivory, A-line wedding gown looking as beautiful as ever. Little details of embroidery diffused its way down the dress, crystals stitched on little areas of the gown and around the waist followed by a brush train trailing behind her. Her brown hair was pulled back and up into a bun with a crowned veil attached to the back. \u201cShe\u2019s so gorgeous\u201d, Y/N whispered to herself rather than anyone else, astounded by her beauty. The area was filled with sounds of camera shutters clicking, the whisperings of people in awe of such utter beauty and the harmony of the orchestra. </p><p>John stood and watched on as the previous love of his life walked down the aisle to marry a man that wasn\u2019t him. She still looked as beautiful as she did the first day he laid his eyes on her, her brown eyes still as kind as ever, the same smile gracing her smile, defining those rosy cheeks of hers. As Helen looked around the area, her eyes fell on John\u2019s, both of their breaths hitching in their throats making it seem like they were the only two people present at that time. Her eyes flickered to the stunning girl on his side, her mauve dress making her stand out among the rest of the crowd who stuck with the bright, pastel colours of beige and light greys. The girl looked at her with inspired eyes, eyes that reflected her pureness, helping Helen coming to the conclusion that she can\u2019t have been any older than 25, her eyes hadn\u2019t seen much in life for long to still have that glow of hope in them. The girl was smiling towards her, not a plastic smile or a malicious one, but a real, tender smile. Helen couldn\u2019t help but return the smile, a mellow feeling replacing her previous melancholic one as she gave John a final glance along with her smile, to convey that there were no hard feelings before she diverted her attention back to the man she now loved\u2014Matthew.</p><p>Relief flooded John once he and Y/N were sent that smile, quietening his mind for a little. \u201cShe seems really nice, I like her\u201d, Y/N added making John release a breathy laugh. </p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019m glad that you like my ex, that\u2019s always good to know\u201d. They watched on as Helen met Matthew at the front, both of their smiles never faltering as they did so. They both did their vows, and while John stiffened at hearing the words \u2018I do\u2019 come out of Helen\u2019s mouth, he relaxed soon after he looked down at the angel sat beside him, allowing himself to finally begin to let Helen go for sure this time. Everyone got up on their feet and cheered as the now happily married couple made their way down the aisle and into the reception area, the guests soon followed after them. Once most people had cleared the area, Y/N twirled around to meet John again, her pride for John beaming off of her without her even needing to say a word. She threw her hands around his neck and brought him in for a soothing hug, John returning the hug just as fast as they stood there for a little just like that, revelling in each other\u2019s embrace. </p><p>Parting from one another, they walked hand in hand to the reception area, Y/N grabbing two champagne flutes filled with the golden, sparkling beverage and handing one to John. \u201cI know, I know, \u2018<i>ugh, why do you drink this stuff Y/N, what\u2019s wrong with you, I brood and only drink expensive, aged whiskey neats</i>\u2019 but it\u2019s free and I think we both need to loosen up after this.\u201d.</p><p>\u201cI agree with everything but the \u2018<i>i brood and only drink expensive, aged whiskey</i>\u2019\u201d John replied, raising his glass as Y/N mimicked the same with a \u2018<i>skol</i>\u2019 as they sipped the golden bubbly, lifting their faces to give the exact same reaction of revulsion, making Y/N burst out laughing as John chuckled along with her, drawing the attention of the people around them but they couldn\u2019t care less. </p><p>\u201cWe are such annoying guests, no one should invite us anywhere together. And if they do, we\u2019d need some sort of restraining order from each other\u201d, Y/N sniggered as she turned to look at all the disapproving faces. </p><p>\u201cBut where would be the fun in that, hm?\u201d, leaning closer, he whispered, \u201cI think an assassin and a princess make a pretty good duo, but hey, that\u2019s just my opinion\u201d. The feeling of his hot breath against her ear made a shiver run down her spine, feeling a familiar knot in her stomach tighten at the thought of him whispering other things in her ear in a much different context. Noticing the change in her posture, John added, \u201cwhat\u2019s going on in that beautiful mind of yours, <i>princess</i>?\u201d. As if on cue, a waiter walked by with a tray full of flutes of champagne and Y/N grabbed another, downing her first one quickly and then downing this one straight after, giving her the <i>much</i> needed confidence boost to deal with the devil in disguise next to her. Before she could reply, again as if on cue, the newly wed couple made their grand entrance as everyone cheered and jeered as Matthew clasped his hands together giving a \u2018champion\u2019 pose, Helen close beside him laughing at his childishness. </p><p>Y/N could feel her empty stomach cry out for food, the bubbly probably not helping the case of keeping the rumbling of her stomach quiet. \u201cCan we just eat already?\u201d, she mumbled to herself, quiet enough that only she and John would be able to hear her. </p><p>\u201cDinner will be soon. We just need to listen through these speeches and their first dance then we can grab something to eat, does that sound achievable or is that too much to ask for <i>princess</i>?\u201d, John asked sympathetically, though a tone of mischief came through as well, Y/N instantly regretting telling him the idea of her being a princess, but secretly it was doing things to her. Gulping, she nodded as she felt the knot in her stomach tighten even more out of hunger for the handsome man that had been driving her crazy the past three years, especially now rather than for food at that moment in time. </p><p>Several sentimental and cheesy speeches later, it finally came to the couple\u2019s first dance. Everyone watched as both of them in an interactional dance, effortlessly reciprocating one another\u2019s movement and gliding through the dance floor, slowing down as the song reduced in tempo as Helen rest her head against Matthew\u2019s shoulder as the song came to an end and the crowd burst into an encore. They then announced that it was time for dinner, and Y/N\u2019s face lit up at the sound of the word \u2018dinner\u2019. </p><p>\u2014</p><p>After dinner, Y/N excused herself to the bathroom to freshen up. She looked at herself in the mirror with the same smile she had on back at home, thinking that maybe this smile would never come off of her face ever again. She took a much needed toilet break to empty her bladder before fixing any loose pieces of hair that were out of place along with her lipstick, spritzing her face with a refresher mist and once happy with everything, left to go look for John. On her way to do so, she grabbed <i>another</i> glass of champagne, gulping the whole thing down in one again as she could feel the alcohol start to course through her blood to liven her up a little, but not enough to make her tipsy or drunk which was the last thing she\u2019d want to do here. As she glanced around the room, a man approached her. He was shorter than John and had a head of black hair along with striking blue eyes, a peppered beard and was clad in a navy blue suit. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a girl like you doing here all by yourself?\u201d, he asked, the stench of alcohol present in his breath as he spoke and that\u2019s when Y/N realised how close he was to her. </p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m not by myself. I\u2019m looking for my boyfriend\u201d, she politely replied. She was never one to be rude even in situations like this. \u201cLook, I\u2019ve found him!\u201d, she exclaimed as the man turned his head to look at who exactly she was talking about before he froze and instantly left. Y/N mentally thanked John for his intimidating self for saving her yet again. John wasn\u2019t alone, however. He was sat around a table, an older man who she recognised as the man that walked Helen down the aisle, along with several other men in tuxedos who she assumed to be part of Matthew\u2019s family. John wore that smouldering gaze again, jaw clenched as he sat up straight, a behaviour he displayed when he got defensive, professionally that is. She guessed they were grilling him about his life currently, post-Helen. Y/N worked quickly to make her way to him, taking long, confident strides towards him, though his back was towards her from this angle. </p><p>She got closer, her heels loud enough to give John a heads up that it was her and not someone sneaking up on him. She bent down, wrapping her arms around him in a soft embrace as part of her \u2018<i>mission: save John</i>\u2019, pressing a small kiss against his cheek. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I was gone so long, <i>sweetie</i>. I got lost on my way there and then I got a phone call from Will, you know the one from project management about the recent research conducted out on the Ligand binding assay and he just kept waffling, bless him\u2014oh my gosh, I\u2019m so sorry for interrupting! Where are my manners? Hi, I\u2019m Y/N, <i>John\u2019s girlfriend</i>. So nice to meet you all\u201d. They all sat with their eyes practically bulging out of their sockets, mouths agape but Y/N wasn\u2019t sure whether it was her waffling about some weird pharma model or if she\u2019d just grown an extra head. </p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s okay, <i>love</i>. Me and the guys here were just having a friendly conversation on just how lucky I\u2019ve been to have such a <i>wonderful</i> woman like you in my life. I hope everything\u2019s okay with Will?\u201d, John replied back, going along with the act you started. </p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s fine with Will, he just wanted to clarify some details with me about our next research project. And, stop it you. <i><b>I\u2019m</b></i> the lucky one, Jonathan Wick. You best have played nice with the <i>boys</i> here\u201d, she said, applying some emphasis on the word \u2018boys\u2019 as she turned to look at the other faces surrounding the table, letting her hands roam John\u2019s chest as she lightly padded her fingers across his stiff torso. \u201cI\u2019d hate to do this, but I need to borrow my dear, John here. You take care of yourselves, boys.\u201d, she finished a John bid them all a \u2018good evening\u2019 as he got up from the table, and much to Y/N\u2019s surprise, wrapped his arm around her waist. Y/N made sure to swing her hips a little as she strutted away from them, a grin plastered to her face as people moved out of their way, parting like Noah and the Red Sea. \u201cYou were right, a princess and an assassin do make a great duo\u201d. </p><p>\u201cOr maybe it\u2019s just us\u201d, he murmured back, feeling the effect of Y/N dig into his soul, clouding any other thought apart from her hands roaming his chest. \u201cThanks for saving me back there, those assholes wouldn\u2019t drop the whole \u2018<i>so tell us how shit your life is now without Helen</i>\u2019, not in those exact words but close enough\u201d. </p><p>\u201cIt was worth it to see all their dumb faces so shook. They need to do something better with their lives asap\u201d. </p><p>They were close approaching the dance floor, and a familiar midtempo love ballad that Y/N knew all too well began to play. Grabbing his hand, she tugged him towards the dance floor. \u201cCan we have this one dance, please? This is one of my favourite songs ever\u201d, she quietly asked, wide eyes staring up at him with such adoration that he couldn\u2019t say no. Wrapping his arms around her waist, she did the same with hers wrapping around his neck, bringing his head down closer to hers. Y/N softly sang the words to the song into his ear, \u201c<i>I\u2019ll trade your broken wings for mine, I\u2019ve seen your scars and kissed your crimes</i>\u201d, John immediately relaxed into her, her soft voice along with the lyrics and beautiful taking a toll. \u201c<i>Sweet love all night long, all I wanna, ain\u2019t no other, we together, I remember, sweet love all night long</i>\u201d. Y/N moved her face from his shoulder, making John gaze into her heavenly eyes again as she sang, \u201c<i>they say true love\u2019s the greatest weapon, to win the war caused by pain, but every diamond has imperfections, but my love\u2019s too pure to watch it chip away</i>\u201d. </p><p>Y/N could feel her eyes build with water, her feelings towards John too overwhelming to push away any longer. John felt it too, the ache of his heart longing to have Y/N. They both couldn\u2019t do it anymore. The song was nearing its end, and John whispered, \u201cif you don\u2019t want this, then move away now\u201d. When he saw her still standing there, he made his move. He slowly leaned in, close enough to feel her breath against his mouth before Y/N finally closed the gap between them. The kiss was passionate and had no rush to it, both of them savouring the taste of each other. They had both waited <i>three</i> years for this to happen, and here it was. And boy, did it feel <i>good</i>. Their mouths moved in sync with one another before Y/N had to move away and gasp for oxygen . The song came to a gentle stop as another started playing, eyes were glued to John and Y/N staring in wonder at the moment they\u2019d just shared. They hadn\u2019t noticed Helen\u2019s eyes on them too, watching on as warmth filled her heart to see John finally with someone that made him feel as though the sun was something built for him in a tool shed. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve waited three damn years for that, Wick, and it was so <i>damn</i> worth it.\u201d, Y/N admitted, as she brought her fingers up to his lips to wipe her lipstick off of them.</p><p>\u201cI know, because so have I\u201d. Y/N released a big yawn, the food, slow music and waking up at 5am aiding her into a tired state. \u201cSomeone looks tired. Come on, let\u2019s go home\u201d. Y/N attempted to argue against him but then thoughts of better things happening outside of this place goaded her into agreeing with him and letting him win the battle of whether to stay or leave. John retrieved his car from the valet, opening the door one last time for Y/N to hop in as he did the same. Y/N undid her heels and slid them off her sore feet, sighing in relief at the feeling no longer having her feet encaged in a torture machine.</p><p>They both drove in a blissful silence, quiet music filling the atmosphere, creating a safe space for the both of them. The clear roads meant that they arrived back at Y/N\u2019s place faster than it would\u2019ve usually taken. </p><p>\u201cI really enjoyed today, thank you for bringing me as your plus one and allowing me to live my guilty pleasure of being a princess for one day in my life, Prince Charming\u201d </p><p>\u201cIf I had known today would\u2019ve gone the way it did, I would\u2019ve never contemplated not going. Thank you for coming with me, I don\u2019t know how I would have survived the day without your presence\u201d. Y/N looked hesitantly at him, worried if her next words would make or break their current relationship for good but she had to try. </p><p>\u201cJohn, I\u2019ve been meaning to tell you something for a really long time now but I never knew if you\u2019d feel the same way so I never did because I didn\u2019t want to lose you.\u201d, she started as John listened intently to her words, his brow slightly furrowed. \u201c<i>I really like you</i>, John Wick. I\u2019ve liked you for a really long time now and I\u2019ve been bursting at the seams to tell y\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>I really like you too</i>, Y/N. Fuck, you\u2019ve been <i>driving me up a wall</i> since the first day we properly met. And your hijinks today? Sitting on my lap in the photobooth? Kissing my cheek? All the suggestive things you said? Calling me your boyfriend the whole day? Rubbing your hands up and down my chest? And don\u2019t think I didn\u2019t notice the way you swayed those fucking <i>gorgeous</i> hips.\u201d. \u2018So he did notice all these little things\u2019, she thought to herself, feeling her pride build up as that knot in her stomach returned. Y/N undid her seatbelt and climbed over quickly, but carefully, to John\u2019s seat, straddling his lap. </p><p>\u201cI <i>need</i> you so badly, John\u201d, she said in a hushed tone as she sat herself down on his lap, her burning hot core against his clothed member, John\u2019s eyes beginning to cloud with the same lust that filled Y/N\u2019s eyes. </p><p>\u201cTell me what you want me to do to you\u201d, John\u2019s voice rumbled in a low tone, a tone he\u2019d only ever used when out on his \u2018business ventures\u2019 but it made the sweet girl on his lap even wetter, feeling a wet spot forming over the crotch of his trousers from it soaking through her panties. </p><p>\u201cI want you to fuck me. I <i>need</i> you to <i>fuck</i> me. I <i>need</i> to feel you inside of me, please John, <i>please fuck me</i>\u201d, she moaned, looking at him with pleading eyes, instantly making John hard against her. Pulling the straps of her dress down, she revealed the blue bra she chose to wear in case this did happen. Unfastening her bra, she threw it over to the passenger seat as John responded with a low moan at the sight of her beautiful breasts. </p><p>Reaching out, the calloused padding of his hands cupped her perfect, smooth breasts, fondling them with extra care as Y/N bit her lip to prevent a moan from escaping her mouth. He moved his fingers to her hardened nipples and used his index finger and thumb to gently roll the peaks between them, tugging slightly at them as he watched the girl in front of him become undone. Leaning forward, he brought his lips to her breasts, covering them each in small, subtle kisses and then moving his attention back to her nipples again, running his tongue up against them, the air now hitting her peaks becoming cold, making Y/N delve in the sensitivity it brought about. Sensing that the cold air was increasing her sensitivity, John purposely blew air from out of his mouth against her stiffened peaks. \u201cDoes that feel good, <i>princess</i>?\u201d, the man beneath her asked, Y/N\u2019s heart fluttering at the pet name he adopted for her. Nodding furiously, she tried to reply with a \u2018yes\u2019 until the \u2018yes\u2019 stretched out into a melodious moan. Y/N dug her hips against his, savouring the friction caused by the layers of fabric between them, moving her hips back and forth over his hard on, producing a gruff moan elicited by the boogeyman himself. </p><p>\u201cOh, John, please I-I can\u2019t\u2014I need you inside me. <i>Please</i>.\u201d, her begs filled the space within the car. </p><p>\u201cY/N, wait. Are you sure you want this?\u201d, bringing his fingers to her chin, making her look into his lovesick, chocolate eyes. \u201cI need to hear it from you one last time\u201d. Moving her face closer to his, mere <i>centimetres</i> away from touching his lips, she whispered the words \u2018<i>I want this, John.</i> I\u2019m sure\u2019. And with that, John worked quick to unbuckle his belt, \u201cI just need you to lift yourself up a little so I can get these pants down, be careful, wouldn\u2019t want my princess to hit her poor head against the roof of the car. If we\u2019re going to do this, I need you awake, unless you\u2019re into that sort of thing\u201d, the last bit making Y/N giggle.</p><p>\u201cYou know me so well, and the worst part is even with your little warning about hitting my head against the roof of the car, I\u2019d <i>still</i> do it\u201d, lifting herself up slightly, enough for John to shuffle his clothing down and freeing his member. Y/N\u2019s eyes immediately glued to the throbbing, hard length in front of her eyes. The tip was leaking precum and the veins were prominent, a large one on the underside of his thick length. Without hesitation, she leaned forward moving her dress out the way by lifting it and bundling it around her waist, sliding her soaked panties to the side and pressing her hands against his shoulders as support as she lowered herself down onto his large cock. </p><p>John hissed as he felt his cock being embraced by tight, wet walls clenching down on him, the beautiful girl in front of him gasping with her mouth wide open, averting his gaze from her and down to where her eyes were fastened to, moaning as they watched his cock <i>disappear</i> deep inside of her tight hole. There was something so intimate about watching the way she bounced up and down, the way her mouth was ajar, prompting the symphony of moans and gasps and cries to slide past those flawless, plump lips. John could practically see the ripples of pleasure wave through her, passing like electrical current within a parallel circuit, pleasure reaching every inch of her deprived body. </p><p>\u201cFuck\u2014Y/N you feel so fucking good. You\u2019re fucking me so well, <i>princess</i>\u201d, praising her through gritted teeth, he moved one of his hands down to her clit, beginning to rub little circles over it, causing Y/N to squeal, the overwhelming pleasure causing her body to buck into John\u2019s, making her rest her head against the junction between his neck and shoulder, mewling into his ear provoking John to fuck up into her, gripping her hips harshly. </p><p>\u201cOh god, John\u201d, she breathed, lifting her face to look him in the eyes with her own E/C ones that had started to brim with tears as the need for release became too much. The windows of the car had long steamed up, shielding others from the sin that they were currently indulging in. John was hitting her g spot, over and over as he thrust his hips up against her, rewarded with a whine in return of his action. \u201cPlease\u2026 <i>please</i> John, I can\u2019t hold it for much longer, please let me cum\u201d. </p><p>Also nearing his own orgasm, John dug his fingers further into the plush flesh around her hips, making sure they\u2019d leave bruises for her to wake up to the next day, his thrusts becoming sloppier and more lax and his breathing ragged and increasingly desperate. \u201cYeah\u2026 come on <i>princess</i>, cum for me. Cum all over my cock, do it sweetheart\u201d, he instructed as he tried coaxing her orgasm out, feeling her tremble as she teetered over the edge, finally reaching sweet release with a cry, letting her head roll onto his shoulders as she fell apart in his lap. John delved in the feeling of her tight pussy clenching around him, ushering him to reach his own climax with one final thrust, exploding deep inside of her with a deep growl, holding her hips down in place so all of him was buried inside her. Heavy breathing filled the car, along with the whimpers that fell from Y/N\u2019s throat, triggering John to move his hands to her back, gently rubbing circles against it to aid her in coming down from her high. </p><p>A few moments had passed, both of them sat in the same position as their senses slowly returned to them as John was still buried inside Y/N, a thin sheen of sweat covering the both of them. Giving it all her energy, she lift her head up, meeting John\u2019s eyes as she rest her forehead against his. \u201c<i>Wow</i>\u201d, he murmured as that all too familiar smile of hers returned on her face.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019ve waited three years for this and it finally happened, albeit in your car, but it still happened\u201d. Now it was John\u2019s turn to smile as he leaned in and kissed her one final time. Sliding herself off of him, she slid her panties back over her core, honestly not minding that her favourite set had been ruined with their filth as she grabbed her bra from her seat, moving it so she could sit herself back and off of John\u2019s lap, much to her internal conflict against doing so. She didn\u2019t even bother putting the bra back on, simply placing it on her lap as John pulled his trousers back up and buckled his belt up again. \u201cThank you for such a wonderful day, Jonathan. I think this has probably taken the top spot for the best day of my life\u201d.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you for coming with me today. Thank you for agreeing to be my plus one and making this the best day of <i>my</i> life.\u201d, John replied as he brought her hand to his mouth a placed a loving kiss against her knuckles. </p><p><b>\u201cWe really do make a pretty good badass princess-assassin duo, hm?\u201d.</b></p></p>",

I\u2019ve had so much fun writing this mini series and I hope this final part lives up to your expectations. Once again, thank you for all your love and kind words, I see it all and appreciate every single one of you. I hope you all enjoy!!) </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cJohn, this is all so pretty! Look at the petal covered aisle, and oh my goodness, look at that chandelier back there. Do you think I\u2019ll ever be lucky enough to have a wedding as pretty as this?\u201d, Y/N asked, her hopeful eyes meeting his, oblivious to anyone else around her other than the man that stood beside her. Her question caught John off guard, thoughts kicking in of Y/N getting married one day, thoughts of how alluring she\u2019d look dressed in a pristine, white wedding dress, standing at that altar, meeting his own eyes\u2014\u201cearth to Wick? Do we have a copy? Helloooooo?\u201d, the figure beside him mimicked a radio voice as she waved her hand frantically in front of his face in attempts to bring him back down to the present. \u201cOH MY GOD, THERE\u2019S A PHOTOBOOTH, COME QUICK BEFORE ANYONE ELSE GETS IN THERE\u201d, she animatedly cried, making sure he trailed behind her as she awkwardly strode her way to the white booth with the dark curtain divide open, indicating no one else was in the booth. Practically shoving John inside the small booth, she hopped in herself after he sat down on the \u2018seat\u2019 that was attached to the metal shelling, taking up what little space there was to begin with. </p><p>\u201cEr, Y/N, is this a photobooth or a solitary confinement chamber painted to look like some sort of cute thing, because right now I\u2019m thinking the latter\u201d, he sarcastically said, watching as she stood in the middle of the booth trying to figure out how this would ever work. Swiping the black curtain cover closed, she turned to John and grinned. </p><p>\u201cGuess we\u2019ll just have to improve with the seating then\u201d. She quickly sat herself down on his lap, a small gasp being elicited from the man beneath her as her grin widened. Her soft, plush ass pressed into him, John felt his cheeks flush with the sheer contact of her against his most intimate parts. \u201cAre you kidding? $3? We have to pay $3 damn dollars for 2 strips of 4 tiny photos?\u201d, a frown graced her face reflecting the utter disgust she felt, making John laugh at how she was acting like some frugal old woman. Sliding his hand into the inner pocket of his blazer, he revealed his leather wallet, pulling out $3 and sliding the notes into the machine, listening to it whir as it hungrily accepted his money.</p><p>\u201cHappy now?\u201d He asked, receiving a response of rapid nodding and a cheery \u2018thank you\u2019, with the \u2018you\u2019 being elongated into a \u2018youuuu\u2019 along with a wide, toothy smile. Selecting the \u2018classic\u2019 option, they both readied themselves for the photos. The first photo consisted of them both making goofy faces, Y/N sticking her tongue out and John with his mouth open pretending to look shocked with his eyes wide. The next, both of them feigning \u2018cool\u2019 expressions, pouting as Y/N held up the Shaka sign and John made devil horns out of his hands. The third photo contained Y/N with her hands wrapped around John\u2019s neck and both of them naturally laughing at how silly they felt, capturing a moment of genuine happiness and in the final photo, Y/N brought her soft lips to his bearded cheek and gave it a loving kiss, John grinning from ear to ear before he could even react to it as the photo was taken, leaving his mouth agape after the final photo was snapped and making the girl sitting on his lap crack up with laughter at just how shook he looked. Hopping up and snapping the curtain open, she left the booth and waited outside for the photos to be printed whilst John sat there astonished and about 50% more into her\u2014 if that was even possible. </p><p>\u201cJohn, look! Look at how <i>cute</i> we are, oh my gosh aren\u2019t we so <i>adorable</i>? This needs to go in some modern art gallery or some shit\u201d. Handing John one copy of the photos, she popped her copy into her clutch and couldn\u2019t help but beam towards John, pure joy and love filling her heart and flowing through every vein and artery, metastasising its way all through her body. John stood for a moment, staring at the photos that he held in his hand, amazed at how easily this girl had made him fall for her. He wasn\u2019t sure how much longer he\u2019d be able to hide these feelings, utter fear building up inside him at the thought of having to let her go or even worse, her letting him go and not wanting anything to do with him. He couldn\u2019t remember a time when he felt so vulnerable apart from one time\u2014 when those dreaded words of \u2018I don\u2019t think this is working out\u2019 fell out of Helen\u2019s mouth like beads descending from a broken piece of string, the next word falling faster than the one before it. Clearing his head of the bad memory, he popped his photos into one his inner blazer pockets and returned his attention back to the delighted girl, concern breaching those starry eyes as if to ask \u2018are you okay?\u2019, which John gave a small nod along with a simple ghost of a smile. \u201cLet\u2019s go find our seats, we\u2019ve been standing far too long for my liking minus my seat consisting of your lap, especially in these heels goddamn it, <i>why</i> did I wear these, John?\u201d, she muttered with frustration, giving a small pout like a tired child would do.</p><p>\u201cWell, you thought they looked pretty and despite wearing them, you\u2019re still <i>shorter</i> than me, so\u2026\u201d, John replied, Y/N\u2019s mouth taking an \u2018O\u2019 shape of pretend offence, her hand on her heart and giving an exaggerated \u2018ouch\u2019, making the corners of John\u2019s mouth lift up. \u201cI\u2019m just kidding, it doesn\u2019t make you any less <i>beautiful</i> and most importantly, <i>any less Y/N</i>\u201d, he softly spoke, bringing his finger to the bottom of her chin and watching as her mouth returned to her normal, toothy smile. \u201cNow, let\u2019s go find ourselves some good seats before we get stuck having to sit next to a weirdo who has no respect for personal space\u201d, he said as Y/N linked her arm around his and they both made their way to the ceremony area.</p><p>More guests started to pile in, the area soon full to the brim of a diversity of people taking their seats and chatting joyfully. They both chose their seats between the back and the middle, sitting somewhere close to the end of the row for an easy exit if need be. They both sat close together, John\u2019s knees touching Y/N\u2019s, hands still entwined in a gesture of comfort and support, maybe something even more intimate. \u201cHey, John, remember when you said \u2018stuck sitting next to some weirdo who has no respect for personal space\u2019, I think you were secretly foreshadowing this\u201d, she said as she used her other hand and waved her finger between the two of them. </p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. I think I was hinting at <i>Phil</i> beside me\u201d, he replied with a slight groan, tilting his head to his right to show Y/N exactly what he was talking about. And he was right. The man sat beside him, albeit was much smaller compared to John (in more ways than one, she thought and tried to suppress a laugh from escaping), had no problem with manspreading his legs wider than need be, his leg pressed against John\u2019s as in some kind of territorial battle for leg space. </p><p>\u201cYou reckon he wants some of that leg action of yours, Jonathan? I don\u2019t blame him\u201d, she shrugged as John\u2019s breath caught at the back of his throat. \u201cExcuse me, sir, would you mind moving your leg away from my boyfriend\u2019s, he just had some surgery done on his poor, fractured femur and currently has a splint on that leg and any pressure such as your leg against his can be extremely painful, so if you would ever so <i>kindly</i> remove your leg from his, it would be really appreciated\u201d. The man looked at Y/N with a stony expression, opening his mouth to say blunt \u2018no\u2019, but before he could, John turned towards his direction and recognition hit the gross man like a runaway train. He\u2019d obviously recognised the infamous man staring him down right now, immediately closing his legs with a sheepish \u2018sorry\u2019 as his face turned a bright crimson. \u201cLiterally all you needed to do was look the man in the eyes and he closed his legs as if he was born a virgin again. You could\u2019ve saved me from all my waffling by just sending your intense gaze his way\u201d.</p><p>\u201cComes with the reputation, plus I enjoyed your waffling. Boyfriend who just had surgery done on his fractured femur but miraculously can walk perfectly?\u201d, he sniggered.</p><p>\u201cWell, considering all the shit you\u2019ve been through, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it actually did happen. Not like I\u2019d be able to tell let alone anyone else in this whole venue\u201d, she defended her decision, quickly adding, \u201cand yes, boyfriend\u201d, clearing her voice she said aloud, \u201cyes, everyone, here is my <i>loving</i>, ninja of a boyfriend, John Wick who I <i>adore</i> dearly with my whole heart\u201d. Some heads turned their direction as Y/N laid her head on his shoulder, taking the opportunity to breathe in the scent of John\u2019s cologne and also witness the work of her words on him, feeling the heat of his body rise against his neck as he whispered,</p><p>\u201cI thought you said you didn\u2019t want to \u2018steal the show at someone else\u2019s wedding\u2019?\u201d. </p><p>\u201cWhoopsie, my bad. Couldn\u2019t help it when I\u2019m here with <i>you</i>\u201d. Y/N knew she was playing a game that could go either one of two ways: she succeeds in conveying just how much she wanted John to herself through her animated confessions that she played off as jokes, or she\u2019d completely scare John away, detering him from ever wanting to be near her again let alone hear from her. \u201cJohn, listen, I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019ve made you feel uncomfortable. You just make me so fricking happy and I can\u2019t help but act like this whenever I\u2019m around you, even if it\u2019s at someone else\u2019s wedding. Please forgive me\u2014\u201d. Before she could even finish her sentence, John pressed his finger to his mouth, shushing her gently as he brought her hand to his mouth, pressing a light kiss to the back of it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re rambling again. You don\u2019t need to apologise for anything, Y/N, especially not for being you. I know you, and I know you\u2019re just excited and cheerful about being here. I\u2019d rather my normal Y/N than a fabricated Y/N pretending to be someone that she isn\u2019t\u201d. Y/N could feel emotions of affection bubbling inside her and just wanted to scream \u2018hey, I think I\u2019m falling in love with you, please feel the same way\u2019. </p><p>\u201c3 years later and you still manage to get me with those words of yours. You always know all the right things to say. Thank you, Jonathan\u201d. Before he could reply, everyone cheered as a man in a black and white tuxedo made his way down the aisle to the front, his brunette, pompadour hair impeccable, flashing his bright, white, bleached teeth towards all the faces around the room in a perfect smile. Y/N could feel the hand around hers tighten, bringing her free hand to rest on top of his clenching hand, tracing small pictures over the top of his hand to try and help him relax a bit. Turning her head, she could see how his jaw clenched and his smouldering eyes followed Matthew\u2019s every action. </p><p>A few minutes had passed since Matthew\u2019s entrance and John was getting increasingly uncomfortable, his leg jittering up and down in anticipation as if he was the one standing in Matthew\u2019s place awaiting Helen\u2019s arrival, wanting this whole thing to just be over and to just be alone with Y/N watching one of her Disney movies. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019ll be okay through this? We can always go back inside and have a drink or something\u201d, Y/N sincerely asked with worry laced in her voice. John just nodded, not wanting to speak worried that his voice would deceive his answer of \u2018yes, I\u2019ll be okay\u2019.</p><p>Soon after, all the bridesmaids and flower girls started walking down the aisle, soft music playing as the girls dressed in ros\u00e8 coloured dresses made their way down the white flooring. Once they had all reached the front, the orchestra had begun to play a gentle piece of music, indicating that the bride was next, everyone moving to stand, patiently awaiting her arrival. There Helen was, bound in an ivory, A-line wedding gown looking as beautiful as ever. Little details of embroidery diffused its way down the dress, crystals stitched on little areas of the gown and around the waist followed by a brush train trailing behind her. Her brown hair was pulled back and up into a bun with a crowned veil attached to the back. \u201cShe\u2019s so gorgeous\u201d, Y/N whispered to herself rather than anyone else, astounded by her beauty. The area was filled with sounds of camera shutters clicking, the whisperings of people in awe of such utter beauty and the harmony of the orchestra. </p><p>John stood and watched on as the previous love of his life walked down the aisle to marry a man that wasn\u2019t him. She still looked as beautiful as she did the first day he laid his eyes on her, her brown eyes still as kind as ever, the same smile gracing her smile, defining those rosy cheeks of hers. As Helen looked around the area, her eyes fell on John\u2019s, both of their breaths hitching in their throats making it seem like they were the only two people present at that time. Her eyes flickered to the stunning girl on his side, her mauve dress making her stand out among the rest of the crowd who stuck with the bright, pastel colours of beige and light greys. The girl looked at her with inspired eyes, eyes that reflected her pureness, helping Helen coming to the conclusion that she can\u2019t have been any older than 25, her eyes hadn\u2019t seen much in life for long to still have that glow of hope in them. The girl was smiling towards her, not a plastic smile or a malicious one, but a real, tender smile. Helen couldn\u2019t help but return the smile, a mellow feeling replacing her previous melancholic one as she gave John a final glance along with her smile, to convey that there were no hard feelings before she diverted her attention back to the man she now loved\u2014Matthew.</p><p>Relief flooded John once he and Y/N were sent that smile, quietening his mind for a little. \u201cShe seems really nice, I like her\u201d, Y/N added making John release a breathy laugh. </p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019m glad that you like my ex, that\u2019s always good to know\u201d. They watched on as Helen met Matthew at the front, both of their smiles never faltering as they did so. They both did their vows, and while John stiffened at hearing the words \u2018I do\u2019 come out of Helen\u2019s mouth, he relaxed soon after he looked down at the angel sat beside him, allowing himself to finally begin to let Helen go for sure this time. Everyone got up on their feet and cheered as the now happily married couple made their way down the aisle and into the reception area, the guests soon followed after them. Once most people had cleared the area, Y/N twirled around to meet John again, her pride for John beaming off of her without her even needing to say a word. She threw her hands around his neck and brought him in for a soothing hug, John returning the hug just as fast as they stood there for a little just like that, revelling in each other\u2019s embrace. </p><p>Parting from one another, they walked hand in hand to the reception area, Y/N grabbing two champagne flutes filled with the golden, sparkling beverage and handing one to John. \u201cI know, I know, \u2018<i>ugh, why do you drink this stuff Y/N, what\u2019s wrong with you, I brood and only drink expensive, aged whiskey neats</i>\u2019 but it\u2019s free and I think we both need to loosen up after this.\u201d.</p><p>\u201cI agree with everything but the \u2018<i>i brood and only drink expensive, aged whiskey</i>\u2019\u201d John replied, raising his glass as Y/N mimicked the same with a \u2018<i>skol</i>\u2019 as they sipped the golden bubbly, lifting their faces to give the exact same reaction of revulsion, making Y/N burst out laughing as John chuckled along with her, drawing the attention of the people around them but they couldn\u2019t care less. </p><p>\u201cWe are such annoying guests, no one should invite us anywhere together. And if they do, we\u2019d need some sort of restraining order from each other\u201d, Y/N sniggered as she turned to look at all the disapproving faces. </p><p>\u201cBut where would be the fun in that, hm?\u201d, leaning closer, he whispered, \u201cI think an assassin and a princess make a pretty good duo, but hey, that\u2019s just my opinion\u201d. The feeling of his hot breath against her ear made a shiver run down her spine, feeling a familiar knot in her stomach tighten at the thought of him whispering other things in her ear in a much different context. Noticing the change in her posture, John added, \u201cwhat\u2019s going on in that beautiful mind of yours, <i>princess</i>?\u201d. As if on cue, a waiter walked by with a tray full of flutes of champagne and Y/N grabbed another, downing her first one quickly and then downing this one straight after, giving her the <i>much</i> needed confidence boost to deal with the devil in disguise next to her. Before she could reply, again as if on cue, the newly wed couple made their grand entrance as everyone cheered and jeered as Matthew clasped his hands together giving a \u2018champion\u2019 pose, Helen close beside him laughing at his childishness. </p><p>Y/N could feel her empty stomach cry out for food, the bubbly probably not helping the case of keeping the rumbling of her stomach quiet. \u201cCan we just eat already?\u201d, she mumbled to herself, quiet enough that only she and John would be able to hear her. </p><p>\u201cDinner will be soon. We just need to listen through these speeches and their first dance then we can grab something to eat, does that sound achievable or is that too much to ask for <i>princess</i>?\u201d, John asked sympathetically, though a tone of mischief came through as well, Y/N instantly regretting telling him the idea of her being a princess, but secretly it was doing things to her. Gulping, she nodded as she felt the knot in her stomach tighten even more out of hunger for the handsome man that had been driving her crazy the past three years, especially now rather than for food at that moment in time. </p><p>Several sentimental and cheesy speeches later, it finally came to the couple\u2019s first dance. Everyone watched as both of them in an interactional dance, effortlessly reciprocating one another\u2019s movement and gliding through the dance floor, slowing down as the song reduced in tempo as Helen rest her head against Matthew\u2019s shoulder as the song came to an end and the crowd burst into an encore. They then announced that it was time for dinner, and Y/N\u2019s face lit up at the sound of the word \u2018dinner\u2019. </p><p>\u2014</p><p>After dinner, Y/N excused herself to the bathroom to freshen up. She looked at herself in the mirror with the same smile she had on back at home, thinking that maybe this smile would never come off of her face ever again. She took a much needed toilet break to empty her bladder before fixing any loose pieces of hair that were out of place along with her lipstick, spritzing her face with a refresher mist and once happy with everything, left to go look for John. On her way to do so, she grabbed <i>another</i> glass of champagne, gulping the whole thing down in one again as she could feel the alcohol start to course through her blood to liven her up a little, but not enough to make her tipsy or drunk which was the last thing she\u2019d want to do here. As she glanced around the room, a man approached her. He was shorter than John and had a head of black hair along with striking blue eyes, a peppered beard and was clad in a navy blue suit. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a girl like you doing here all by yourself?\u201d, he asked, the stench of alcohol present in his breath as he spoke and that\u2019s when Y/N realised how close he was to her. </p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m not by myself. I\u2019m looking for my boyfriend\u201d, she politely replied. She was never one to be rude even in situations like this. \u201cLook, I\u2019ve found him!\u201d, she exclaimed as the man turned his head to look at who exactly she was talking about before he froze and instantly left. Y/N mentally thanked John for his intimidating self for saving her yet again. John wasn\u2019t alone, however. He was sat around a table, an older man who she recognised as the man that walked Helen down the aisle, along with several other men in tuxedos who she assumed to be part of Matthew\u2019s family. John wore that smouldering gaze again, jaw clenched as he sat up straight, a behaviour he displayed when he got defensive, professionally that is. She guessed they were grilling him about his life currently, post-Helen. Y/N worked quickly to make her way to him, taking long, confident strides towards him, though his back was towards her from this angle. </p><p>She got closer, her heels loud enough to give John a heads up that it was her and not someone sneaking up on him. She bent down, wrapping her arms around him in a soft embrace as part of her \u2018<i>mission: save John</i>\u2019, pressing a small kiss against his cheek. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I was gone so long, <i>sweetie</i>. I got lost on my way there and then I got a phone call from Will, you know the one from project management about the recent research conducted out on the Ligand binding assay and he just kept waffling, bless him\u2014oh my gosh, I\u2019m so sorry for interrupting! Where are my manners? Hi, I\u2019m Y/N, <i>John\u2019s girlfriend</i>. So nice to meet you all\u201d. They all sat with their eyes practically bulging out of their sockets, mouths agape but Y/N wasn\u2019t sure whether it was her waffling about some weird pharma model or if she\u2019d just grown an extra head. </p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s okay, <i>love</i>. Me and the guys here were just having a friendly conversation on just how lucky I\u2019ve been to have such a <i>wonderful</i> woman like you in my life. I hope everything\u2019s okay with Will?\u201d, John replied back, going along with the act you started. </p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s fine with Will, he just wanted to clarify some details with me about our next research project. And, stop it you. <i><b>I\u2019m</b></i> the lucky one, Jonathan Wick. You best have played nice with the <i>boys</i> here\u201d, she said, applying some emphasis on the word \u2018boys\u2019 as she turned to look at the other faces surrounding the table, letting her hands roam John\u2019s chest as she lightly padded her fingers across his stiff torso. \u201cI\u2019d hate to do this, but I need to borrow my dear, John here. You take care of yourselves, boys.\u201d, she finished a John bid them all a \u2018good evening\u2019 as he got up from the table, and much to Y/N\u2019s surprise, wrapped his arm around her waist. Y/N made sure to swing her hips a little as she strutted away from them, a grin plastered to her face as people moved out of their way, parting like Noah and the Red Sea. \u201cYou were right, a princess and an assassin do make a great duo\u201d. </p><p>\u201cOr maybe it\u2019s just us\u201d, he murmured back, feeling the effect of Y/N dig into his soul, clouding any other thought apart from her hands roaming his chest. \u201cThanks for saving me back there, those assholes wouldn\u2019t drop the whole \u2018<i>so tell us how shit your life is now without Helen</i>\u2019, not in those exact words but close enough\u201d. </p><p>\u201cIt was worth it to see all their dumb faces so shook. They need to do something better with their lives asap\u201d. </p><p>They were close approaching the dance floor, and a familiar midtempo love ballad that Y/N knew all too well began to play. Grabbing his hand, she tugged him towards the dance floor. \u201cCan we have this one dance, please? This is one of my favourite songs ever\u201d, she quietly asked, wide eyes staring up at him with such adoration that he couldn\u2019t say no. Wrapping his arms around her waist, she did the same with hers wrapping around his neck, bringing his head down closer to hers. Y/N softly sang the words to the song into his ear, \u201c<i>I\u2019ll trade your broken wings for mine, I\u2019ve seen your scars and kissed your crimes</i>\u201d, John immediately relaxed into her, her soft voice along with the lyrics and beautiful taking a toll. \u201c<i>Sweet love all night long, all I wanna, ain\u2019t no other, we together, I remember, sweet love all night long</i>\u201d. Y/N moved her face from his shoulder, making John gaze into her heavenly eyes again as she sang, \u201c<i>they say true love\u2019s the greatest weapon, to win the war caused by pain, but every diamond has imperfections, but my love\u2019s too pure to watch it chip away</i>\u201d. </p><p>Y/N could feel her eyes build with water, her feelings towards John too overwhelming to push away any longer. John felt it too, the ache of his heart longing to have Y/N. They both couldn\u2019t do it anymore. The song was nearing its end, and John whispered, \u201cif you don\u2019t want this, then move away now\u201d. When he saw her still standing there, he made his move. He slowly leaned in, close enough to feel her breath against his mouth before Y/N finally closed the gap between them. The kiss was passionate and had no rush to it, both of them savouring the taste of each other. They had both waited <i>three</i> years for this to happen, and here it was. And boy, did it feel <i>good</i>. Their mouths moved in sync with one another before Y/N had to move away and gasp for oxygen . The song came to a gentle stop as another started playing, eyes were glued to John and Y/N staring in wonder at the moment they\u2019d just shared. They hadn\u2019t noticed Helen\u2019s eyes on them too, watching on as warmth filled her heart to see John finally with someone that made him feel as though the sun was something built for him in a tool shed. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve waited three damn years for that, Wick, and it was so <i>damn</i> worth it.\u201d, Y/N admitted, as she brought her fingers up to his lips to wipe her lipstick off of them.</p><p>\u201cI know, because so have I\u201d. Y/N released a big yawn, the food, slow music and waking up at 5am aiding her into a tired state. \u201cSomeone looks tired. Come on, let\u2019s go home\u201d. Y/N attempted to argue against him but then thoughts of better things happening outside of this place goaded her into agreeing with him and letting him win the battle of whether to stay or leave. John retrieved his car from the valet, opening the door one last time for Y/N to hop in as he did the same. Y/N undid her heels and slid them off her sore feet, sighing in relief at the feeling no longer having her feet encaged in a torture machine.</p><p>They both drove in a blissful silence, quiet music filling the atmosphere, creating a safe space for the both of them. The clear roads meant that they arrived back at Y/N\u2019s place faster than it would\u2019ve usually taken. </p><p>\u201cI really enjoyed today, thank you for bringing me as your plus one and allowing me to live my guilty pleasure of being a princess for one day in my life, Prince Charming\u201d </p><p>\u201cIf I had known today would\u2019ve gone the way it did, I would\u2019ve never contemplated not going. Thank you for coming with me, I don\u2019t know how I would have survived the day without your presence\u201d. Y/N looked hesitantly at him, worried if her next words would make or break their current relationship for good but she had to try. </p><p>\u201cJohn, I\u2019ve been meaning to tell you something for a really long time now but I never knew if you\u2019d feel the same way so I never did because I didn\u2019t want to lose you.\u201d, she started as John listened intently to her words, his brow slightly furrowed. \u201c<i>I really like you</i>, John Wick. I\u2019ve liked you for a really long time now and I\u2019ve been bursting at the seams to tell y\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>I really like you too</i>, Y/N. Fuck, you\u2019ve been <i>driving me up a wall</i> since the first day we properly met. And your hijinks today? Sitting on my lap in the photobooth? Kissing my cheek? All the suggestive things you said? Calling me your boyfriend the whole day? Rubbing your hands up and down my chest? And don\u2019t think I didn\u2019t notice the way you swayed those fucking <i>gorgeous</i> hips.\u201d. \u2018So he did notice all these little things\u2019, she thought to herself, feeling her pride build up as that knot in her stomach returned. Y/N undid her seatbelt and climbed over quickly, but carefully, to John\u2019s seat, straddling his lap. </p><p>\u201cI <i>need</i> you so badly, John\u201d, she said in a hushed tone as she sat herself down on his lap, her burning hot core against his clothed member, John\u2019s eyes beginning to cloud with the same lust that filled Y/N\u2019s eyes. </p><p>\u201cTell me what you want me to do to you\u201d, John\u2019s voice rumbled in a low tone, a tone he\u2019d only ever used when out on his \u2018business ventures\u2019 but it made the sweet girl on his lap even wetter, feeling a wet spot forming over the crotch of his trousers from it soaking through her panties. </p><p>\u201cI want you to fuck me. I <i>need</i> you to <i>fuck</i> me. I <i>need</i> to feel you inside of me, please John, <i>please fuck me</i>\u201d, she moaned, looking at him with pleading eyes, instantly making John hard against her. Pulling the straps of her dress down, she revealed the blue bra she chose to wear in case this did happen. Unfastening her bra, she threw it over to the passenger seat as John responded with a low moan at the sight of her beautiful breasts. </p><p>Reaching out, the calloused padding of his hands cupped her perfect, smooth breasts, fondling them with extra care as Y/N bit her lip to prevent a moan from escaping her mouth. He moved his fingers to her hardened nipples and used his index finger and thumb to gently roll the peaks between them, tugging slightly at them as he watched the girl in front of him become undone. Leaning forward, he brought his lips to her breasts, covering them each in small, subtle kisses and then moving his attention back to her nipples again, running his tongue up against them, the air now hitting her peaks becoming cold, making Y/N delve in the sensitivity it brought about. Sensing that the cold air was increasing her sensitivity, John purposely blew air from out of his mouth against her stiffened peaks. \u201cDoes that feel good, <i>princess</i>?\u201d, the man beneath her asked, Y/N\u2019s heart fluttering at the pet name he adopted for her. Nodding furiously, she tried to reply with a \u2018yes\u2019 until the \u2018yes\u2019 stretched out into a melodious moan. Y/N dug her hips against his, savouring the friction caused by the layers of fabric between them, moving her hips back and forth over his hard on, producing a gruff moan elicited by the boogeyman himself. </p><p>\u201cOh, John, please I-I can\u2019t\u2014I need you inside me. <i>Please</i>.\u201d, her begs filled the space within the car. </p><p>\u201cY/N, wait. Are you sure you want this?\u201d, bringing his fingers to her chin, making her look into his lovesick, chocolate eyes. \u201cI need to hear it from you one last time\u201d. Moving her face closer to his, mere <i>centimetres</i> away from touching his lips, she whispered the words \u2018<i>I want this, John.</i> I\u2019m sure\u2019. And with that, John worked quick to unbuckle his belt, \u201cI just need you to lift yourself up a little so I can get these pants down, be careful, wouldn\u2019t want my princess to hit her poor head against the roof of the car. If we\u2019re going to do this, I need you awake, unless you\u2019re into that sort of thing\u201d, the last bit making Y/N giggle.</p><p>\u201cYou know me so well, and the worst part is even with your little warning about hitting my head against the roof of the car, I\u2019d <i>still</i> do it\u201d, lifting herself up slightly, enough for John to shuffle his clothing down and freeing his member. Y/N\u2019s eyes immediately glued to the throbbing, hard length in front of her eyes. The tip was leaking precum and the veins were prominent, a large one on the underside of his thick length. Without hesitation, she leaned forward moving her dress out the way by lifting it and bundling it around her waist, sliding her soaked panties to the side and pressing her hands against his shoulders as support as she lowered herself down onto his large cock. </p><p>John hissed as he felt his cock being embraced by tight, wet walls clenching down on him, the beautiful girl in front of him gasping with her mouth wide open, averting his gaze from her and down to where her eyes were fastened to, moaning as they watched his cock <i>disappear</i> deep inside of her tight hole. There was something so intimate about watching the way she bounced up and down, the way her mouth was ajar, prompting the symphony of moans and gasps and cries to slide past those flawless, plump lips. John could practically see the ripples of pleasure wave through her, passing like electrical current within a parallel circuit, pleasure reaching every inch of her deprived body. </p><p>\u201cFuck\u2014Y/N you feel so fucking good. You\u2019re fucking me so well, <i>princess</i>\u201d, praising her through gritted teeth, he moved one of his hands down to her clit, beginning to rub little circles over it, causing Y/N to squeal, the overwhelming pleasure causing her body to buck into John\u2019s, making her rest her head against the junction between his neck and shoulder, mewling into his ear provoking John to fuck up into her, gripping her hips harshly. </p><p>\u201cOh god, John\u201d, she breathed, lifting her face to look him in the eyes with her own E/C ones that had started to brim with tears as the need for release became too much. The windows of the car had long steamed up, shielding others from the sin that they were currently indulging in. John was hitting her g spot, over and over as he thrust his hips up against her, rewarded with a whine in return of his action. \u201cPlease\u2026 <i>please</i> John, I can\u2019t hold it for much longer, please let me cum\u201d. </p><p>Also nearing his own orgasm, John dug his fingers further into the plush flesh around her hips, making sure they\u2019d leave bruises for her to wake up to the next day, his thrusts becoming sloppier and more lax and his breathing ragged and increasingly desperate. \u201cYeah\u2026 come on <i>princess</i>, cum for me. Cum all over my cock, do it sweetheart\u201d, he instructed as he tried coaxing her orgasm out, feeling her tremble as she teetered over the edge, finally reaching sweet release with a cry, letting her head roll onto his shoulders as she fell apart in his lap. John delved in the feeling of her tight pussy clenching around him, ushering him to reach his own climax with one final thrust, exploding deep inside of her with a deep growl, holding her hips down in place so all of him was buried inside her. Heavy breathing filled the car, along with the whimpers that fell from Y/N\u2019s throat, triggering John to move his hands to her back, gently rubbing circles against it to aid her in coming down from her high. </p><p>A few moments had passed, both of them sat in the same position as their senses slowly returned to them as John was still buried inside Y/N, a thin sheen of sweat covering the both of them. Giving it all her energy, she lift her head up, meeting John\u2019s eyes as she rest her forehead against his. \u201c<i>Wow</i>\u201d, he murmured as that all too familiar smile of hers returned on her face.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019ve waited three years for this and it finally happened, albeit in your car, but it still happened\u201d. Now it was John\u2019s turn to smile as he leaned in and kissed her one final time. Sliding herself off of him, she slid her panties back over her core, honestly not minding that her favourite set had been ruined with their filth as she grabbed her bra from her seat, moving it so she could sit herself back and off of John\u2019s lap, much to her internal conflict against doing so. She didn\u2019t even bother putting the bra back on, simply placing it on her lap as John pulled his trousers back up and buckled his belt up again. \u201cThank you for such a wonderful day, Jonathan. I think this has probably taken the top spot for the best day of my life\u201d.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you for coming with me today. Thank you for agreeing to be my plus one and making this the best day of <i>my</i> life.\u201d, John replied as he brought her hand to his mouth a placed a loving kiss against her knuckles. </p><p><b>\u201cWe really do make a pretty good badass princess-assassin duo, hm?\u201d.</b></p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h1>Plus One: Part 4 (John Wick x Reader)</h1><p><b>Warnings</b>: fluff, language, <b>SMUT</b></p><p><b>Word Count</b>: <i><b>6.4k</b></i> (it&rsquo;s a big boy)</p><p>(A/N: and voila, the final part! I&rsquo;ve had so much fun writing this mini series and I hope this final part lives up to your expectations. Once again, thank you for all your love and kind words, I see it all and appreciate every single one of you. I hope you all enjoy!!) </p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;John, this is all so pretty! Look at the petal covered aisle, and oh my goodness, look at that chandelier back there. Do you think I&rsquo;ll ever be lucky enough to have a wedding as pretty as this?&rdquo;, Y/N asked, her hopeful eyes meeting his, oblivious to anyone else around her other than the man that stood beside her. Her question caught John off guard, thoughts kicking in of Y/N getting married one day, thoughts of how alluring she&rsquo;d look dressed in a pristine, white wedding dress, standing at that altar, meeting his own eyes&mdash;&ldquo;earth to Wick? Do we have a copy? Helloooooo?&rdquo;, the figure beside him mimicked a radio voice as she waved her hand frantically in front of his face in attempts to bring him back down to the present. &ldquo;OH MY GOD, THERE&rsquo;S A PHOTOBOOTH, COME QUICK BEFORE ANYONE ELSE GETS IN THERE&rdquo;, she animatedly cried, making sure he trailed behind her as she awkwardly strode her way to the white booth with the dark curtain divide open, indicating no one else was in the booth. Practically shoving John inside the small booth, she hopped in herself after he sat down on the &lsquo;seat&rsquo; that was attached to the metal shelling, taking up what little space there was to begin with. </p><p>&ldquo;Er, Y/N, is this a photobooth or a solitary confinement chamber painted to look like some sort of cute thing, because right now I&rsquo;m thinking the latter&rdquo;, he sarcastically said, watching as she stood in the middle of the booth trying to figure out how this would ever work. Swiping the black curtain cover closed, she turned to John and grinned. </p><p>&ldquo;Guess we&rsquo;ll just have to improve with the seating then&rdquo;. She quickly sat herself down on his lap, a small gasp being elicited from the man beneath her as her grin widened. Her soft, plush ass pressed into him, John felt his cheeks flush with the sheer contact of her against his most intimate parts. &ldquo;Are you kidding? $3? We have to pay $3 damn dollars for 2 strips of 4 tiny photos?&rdquo;, a frown graced her face reflecting the utter disgust she felt, making John laugh at how she was acting like some frugal old woman. Sliding his hand into the inner pocket of his blazer, he revealed his leather wallet, pulling out $3 and sliding the notes into the machine, listening to it whir as it hungrily accepted his money.</p><p>&ldquo;Happy now?&rdquo; He asked, receiving a response of rapid nodding and a cheery &lsquo;thank you&rsquo;, with the &lsquo;you&rsquo; being elongated into a &lsquo;youuuu&rsquo; along with a wide, toothy smile. Selecting the &lsquo;classic&rsquo; option, they both readied themselves for the photos. The first photo consisted of them both making goofy faces, Y/N sticking her tongue out and John with his mouth open pretending to look shocked with his eyes wide. The next, both of them feigning &lsquo;cool&rsquo; expressions, pouting as Y/N held up the Shaka sign and John made devil horns out of his hands. The third photo contained Y/N with her hands wrapped around John&rsquo;s neck and both of them naturally laughing at how silly they felt, capturing a moment of genuine happiness and in the final photo, Y/N brought her soft lips to his bearded cheek and gave it a loving kiss, John grinning from ear to ear before he could even react to it as the photo was taken, leaving his mouth agape after the final photo was snapped and making the girl sitting on his lap crack up with laughter at just how shook he looked. Hopping up and snapping the curtain open, she left the booth and waited outside for the photos to be printed whilst John sat there astonished and about 50% more into her&mdash; if that was even possible. </p><p>&ldquo;John, look! Look at how <i>cute</i> we are, oh my gosh aren&rsquo;t we so <i>adorable</i>? This needs to go in some modern art gallery or some shit&rdquo;. Handing John one copy of the photos, she popped her copy into her clutch and couldn&rsquo;t help but beam towards John, pure joy and love filling her heart and flowing through every vein and artery, metastasising its way all through her body. John stood for a moment, staring at the photos that he held in his hand, amazed at how easily this girl had made him fall for her. He wasn&rsquo;t sure how much longer he&rsquo;d be able to hide these feelings, utter fear building up inside him at the thought of having to let her go or even worse, her letting him go and not wanting anything to do with him. He couldn&rsquo;t remember a time when he felt so vulnerable apart from one time&mdash; when those dreaded words of &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think this is working out&rsquo; fell out of Helen&rsquo;s mouth like beads descending from a broken piece of string, the next word falling faster than the one before it. Clearing his head of the bad memory, he popped his photos into one his inner blazer pockets and returned his attention back to the delighted girl, concern breaching those starry eyes as if to ask &lsquo;are you okay?&rsquo;, which John gave a small nod along with a simple ghost of a smile. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go find our seats, we&rsquo;ve been standing far too long for my liking minus my seat consisting of your lap, especially in these heels goddamn it, <i>why</i> did I wear these, John?&rdquo;, she muttered with frustration, giving a small pout like a tired child would do.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you thought they looked pretty and despite wearing them, you&rsquo;re still <i>shorter</i> than me, so&hellip;&rdquo;, John replied, Y/N&rsquo;s mouth taking an &lsquo;O&rsquo; shape of pretend offence, her hand on her heart and giving an exaggerated &lsquo;ouch&rsquo;, making the corners of John&rsquo;s mouth lift up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just kidding, it doesn&rsquo;t make you any less <i>beautiful</i> and most importantly, <i>any less Y/N</i>&rdquo;, he softly spoke, bringing his finger to the bottom of her chin and watching as her mouth returned to her normal, toothy smile. &ldquo;Now, let&rsquo;s go find ourselves some good seats before we get stuck having to sit next to a weirdo who has no respect for personal space&rdquo;, he said as Y/N linked her arm around his and they both made their way to the ceremony area.</p><p>More guests started to pile in, the area soon full to the brim of a diversity of people taking their seats and chatting joyfully. They both chose their seats between the back and the middle, sitting somewhere close to the end of the row for an easy exit if need be. They both sat close together, John&rsquo;s knees touching Y/N&rsquo;s, hands still entwined in a gesture of comfort and support, maybe something even more intimate. &ldquo;Hey, John, remember when you said &lsquo;stuck sitting next to some weirdo who has no respect for personal space&rsquo;, I think you were secretly foreshadowing this&rdquo;, she said as she used her other hand and waved her finger between the two of them. </p><p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think so. I think I was hinting at <i>Phil</i> beside me&rdquo;, he replied with a slight groan, tilting his head to his right to show Y/N exactly what he was talking about. And he was right. The man sat beside him, albeit was much smaller compared to John (in more ways than one, she thought and tried to suppress a laugh from escaping), had no problem with manspreading his legs wider than need be, his leg pressed against John&rsquo;s as in some kind of territorial battle for leg space. </p><p>&ldquo;You reckon he wants some of that leg action of yours, Jonathan? I don&rsquo;t blame him&rdquo;, she shrugged as John&rsquo;s breath caught at the back of his throat. &ldquo;Excuse me, sir, would you mind moving your leg away from my boyfriend&rsquo;s, he just had some surgery done on his poor, fractured femur and currently has a splint on that leg and any pressure such as your leg against his can be extremely painful, so if you would ever so <i>kindly</i> remove your leg from his, it would be really appreciated&rdquo;. The man looked at Y/N with a stony expression, opening his mouth to say blunt &lsquo;no&rsquo;, but before he could, John turned towards his direction and recognition hit the gross man like a runaway train. He&rsquo;d obviously recognised the infamous man staring him down right now, immediately closing his legs with a sheepish &lsquo;sorry&rsquo; as his face turned a bright crimson. &ldquo;Literally all you needed to do was look the man in the eyes and he closed his legs as if he was born a virgin again. You could&rsquo;ve saved me from all my waffling by just sending your intense gaze his way&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Comes with the reputation, plus I enjoyed your waffling. Boyfriend who just had surgery done on his fractured femur but miraculously can walk perfectly?&rdquo;, he sniggered.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, considering all the shit you&rsquo;ve been through, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if it actually did happen. Not like I&rsquo;d be able to tell let alone anyone else in this whole venue&rdquo;, she defended her decision, quickly adding, &ldquo;and yes, boyfriend&rdquo;, clearing her voice she said aloud, &ldquo;yes, everyone, here is my <i>loving</i>, ninja of a boyfriend, John Wick who I <i>adore</i> dearly with my whole heart&rdquo;. Some heads turned their direction as Y/N laid her head on his shoulder, taking the opportunity to breathe in the scent of John&rsquo;s cologne and also witness the work of her words on him, feeling the heat of his body rise against his neck as he whispered,</p><p>&ldquo;I thought you said you didn&rsquo;t want to &lsquo;steal the show at someone else&rsquo;s wedding&rsquo;?&rdquo;. </p><p>&ldquo;Whoopsie, my bad. Couldn&rsquo;t help it when I&rsquo;m here with <i>you</i>&rdquo;. Y/N knew she was playing a game that could go either one of two ways: she succeeds in conveying just how much she wanted John to herself through her animated confessions that she played off as jokes, or she&rsquo;d completely scare John away, detering him from ever wanting to be near her again let alone hear from her. &ldquo;John, listen, I&rsquo;m sorry if I&rsquo;ve made you feel uncomfortable. You just make me so fricking happy and I can&rsquo;t help but act like this whenever I&rsquo;m around you, even if it&rsquo;s at someone else&rsquo;s wedding. Please forgive me&mdash;&rdquo;. Before she could even finish her sentence, John pressed his finger to his mouth, shushing her gently as he brought her hand to his mouth, pressing a light kiss to the back of it.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re rambling again. You don&rsquo;t need to apologise for anything, Y/N, especially not for being you. I know you, and I know you&rsquo;re just excited and cheerful about being here. I&rsquo;d rather my normal Y/N than a fabricated Y/N pretending to be someone that she isn&rsquo;t&rdquo;. Y/N could feel emotions of affection bubbling inside her and just wanted to scream &lsquo;hey, I think I&rsquo;m falling in love with you, please feel the same way&rsquo;. </p><p>&ldquo;3 years later and you still manage to get me with those words of yours. You always know all the right things to say. Thank you, Jonathan&rdquo;. Before he could reply, everyone cheered as a man in a black and white tuxedo made his way down the aisle to the front, his brunette, pompadour hair impeccable, flashing his bright, white, bleached teeth towards all the faces around the room in a perfect smile. Y/N could feel the hand around hers tighten, bringing her free hand to rest on top of his clenching hand, tracing small pictures over the top of his hand to try and help him relax a bit. Turning her head, she could see how his jaw clenched and his smouldering eyes followed Matthew&rsquo;s every action. </p><p>A few minutes had passed since Matthew&rsquo;s entrance and John was getting increasingly uncomfortable, his leg jittering up and down in anticipation as if he was the one standing in Matthew&rsquo;s place awaiting Helen&rsquo;s arrival, wanting this whole thing to just be over and to just be alone with Y/N watching one of her Disney movies. &ldquo;Are you sure you&rsquo;ll be okay through this? We can always go back inside and have a drink or something&rdquo;, Y/N sincerely asked with worry laced in her voice. John just nodded, not wanting to speak worried that his voice would deceive his answer of &lsquo;yes, I&rsquo;ll be okay&rsquo;.</p><p>Soon after, all the bridesmaids and flower girls started walking down the aisle, soft music playing as the girls dressed in ros&egrave; coloured dresses made their way down the white flooring. Once they had all reached the front, the orchestra had begun to play a gentle piece of music, indicating that the bride was next, everyone moving to stand, patiently awaiting her arrival. There Helen was, bound in an ivory, A-line wedding gown looking as beautiful as ever. Little details of embroidery diffused its way down the dress, crystals stitched on little areas of the gown and around the waist followed by a brush train trailing behind her. Her brown hair was pulled back and up into a bun with a crowned veil attached to the back. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s so gorgeous&rdquo;, Y/N whispered to herself rather than anyone else, astounded by her beauty. The area was filled with sounds of camera shutters clicking, the whisperings of people in awe of such utter beauty and the harmony of the orchestra. </p><p>John stood and watched on as the previous love of his life walked down the aisle to marry a man that wasn&rsquo;t him. She still looked as beautiful as she did the first day he laid his eyes on her, her brown eyes still as kind as ever, the same smile gracing her smile, defining those rosy cheeks of hers. As Helen looked around the area, her eyes fell on John&rsquo;s, both of their breaths hitching in their throats making it seem like they were the only two people present at that time. Her eyes flickered to the stunning girl on his side, her mauve dress making her stand out among the rest of the crowd who stuck with the bright, pastel colours of beige and light greys. The girl looked at her with inspired eyes, eyes that reflected her pureness, helping Helen coming to the conclusion that she can&rsquo;t have been any older than 25, her eyes hadn&rsquo;t seen much in life for long to still have that glow of hope in them. The girl was smiling towards her, not a plastic smile or a malicious one, but a real, tender smile. Helen couldn&rsquo;t help but return the smile, a mellow feeling replacing her previous melancholic one as she gave John a final glance along with her smile, to convey that there were no hard feelings before she diverted her attention back to the man she now loved&mdash;Matthew.</p><p>Relief flooded John once he and Y/N were sent that smile, quietening his mind for a little. &ldquo;She seems really nice, I like her&rdquo;, Y/N added making John release a breathy laugh. </p><p>&ldquo;Well I&rsquo;m glad that you like my ex, that&rsquo;s always good to know&rdquo;. They watched on as Helen met Matthew at the front, both of their smiles never faltering as they did so. They both did their vows, and while John stiffened at hearing the words &lsquo;I do&rsquo; come out of Helen&rsquo;s mouth, he relaxed soon after he looked down at the angel sat beside him, allowing himself to finally begin to let Helen go for sure this time. Everyone got up on their feet and cheered as the now happily married couple made their way down the aisle and into the reception area, the guests soon followed after them. Once most people had cleared the area, Y/N twirled around to meet John again, her pride for John beaming off of her without her even needing to say a word. She threw her hands around his neck and brought him in for a soothing hug, John returning the hug just as fast as they stood there for a little just like that, revelling in each other&rsquo;s embrace. </p><p>Parting from one another, they walked hand in hand to the reception area, Y/N grabbing two champagne flutes filled with the golden, sparkling beverage and handing one to John. &ldquo;I know, I know, &lsquo;<i>ugh, why do you drink this stuff Y/N, what&rsquo;s wrong with you, I brood and only drink expensive, aged whiskey neats</i>&rsquo; but it&rsquo;s free and I think we both need to loosen up after this.&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;I agree with everything but the &lsquo;<i>i brood and only drink expensive, aged whiskey</i>&rsquo;&rdquo; John replied, raising his glass as Y/N mimicked the same with a &lsquo;<i>skol</i>&rsquo; as they sipped the golden bubbly, lifting their faces to give the exact same reaction of revulsion, making Y/N burst out laughing as John chuckled along with her, drawing the attention of the people around them but they couldn&rsquo;t care less. </p><p>&ldquo;We are such annoying guests, no one should invite us anywhere together. And if they do, we&rsquo;d need some sort of restraining order from each other&rdquo;, Y/N sniggered as she turned to look at all the disapproving faces. </p><p>&ldquo;But where would be the fun in that, hm?&rdquo;, leaning closer, he whispered, &ldquo;I think an assassin and a princess make a pretty good duo, but hey, that&rsquo;s just my opinion&rdquo;. The feeling of his hot breath against her ear made a shiver run down her spine, feeling a familiar knot in her stomach tighten at the thought of him whispering other things in her ear in a much different context. Noticing the change in her posture, John added, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s going on in that beautiful mind of yours, <i>princess</i>?&rdquo;. As if on cue, a waiter walked by with a tray full of flutes of champagne and Y/N grabbed another, downing her first one quickly and then downing this one straight after, giving her the <i>much</i> needed confidence boost to deal with the devil in disguise next to her. Before she could reply, again as if on cue, the newly wed couple made their grand entrance as everyone cheered and jeered as Matthew clasped his hands together giving a &lsquo;champion&rsquo; pose, Helen close beside him laughing at his childishness. </p><p>Y/N could feel her empty stomach cry out for food, the bubbly probably not helping the case of keeping the rumbling of her stomach quiet. &ldquo;Can we just eat already?&rdquo;, she mumbled to herself, quiet enough that only she and John would be able to hear her. </p><p>&ldquo;Dinner will be soon. We just need to listen through these speeches and their first dance then we can grab something to eat, does that sound achievable or is that too much to ask for <i>princess</i>?&rdquo;, John asked sympathetically, though a tone of mischief came through as well, Y/N instantly regretting telling him the idea of her being a princess, but secretly it was doing things to her. Gulping, she nodded as she felt the knot in her stomach tighten even more out of hunger for the handsome man that had been driving her crazy the past three years, especially now rather than for food at that moment in time. </p><p>Several sentimental and cheesy speeches later, it finally came to the couple&rsquo;s first dance. Everyone watched as both of them in an interactional dance, effortlessly reciprocating one another&rsquo;s movement and gliding through the dance floor, slowing down as the song reduced in tempo as Helen rest her head against Matthew&rsquo;s shoulder as the song came to an end and the crowd burst into an encore. They then announced that it was time for dinner, and Y/N&rsquo;s face lit up at the sound of the word &lsquo;dinner&rsquo;. </p><p>&mdash;</p><p>After dinner, Y/N excused herself to the bathroom to freshen up. She looked at herself in the mirror with the same smile she had on back at home, thinking that maybe this smile would never come off of her face ever again. She took a much needed toilet break to empty her bladder before fixing any loose pieces of hair that were out of place along with her lipstick, spritzing her face with a refresher mist and once happy with everything, left to go look for John. On her way to do so, she grabbed <i>another</i> glass of champagne, gulping the whole thing down in one again as she could feel the alcohol start to course through her blood to liven her up a little, but not enough to make her tipsy or drunk which was the last thing she&rsquo;d want to do here. As she glanced around the room, a man approached her. He was shorter than John and had a head of black hair along with striking blue eyes, a peppered beard and was clad in a navy blue suit. </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a girl like you doing here all by yourself?&rdquo;, he asked, the stench of alcohol present in his breath as he spoke and that&rsquo;s when Y/N realised how close he was to her. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not by myself. I&rsquo;m looking for my boyfriend&rdquo;, she politely replied. She was never one to be rude even in situations like this. &ldquo;Look, I&rsquo;ve found him!&rdquo;, she exclaimed as the man turned his head to look at who exactly she was talking about before he froze and instantly left. Y/N mentally thanked John for his intimidating self for saving her yet again. John wasn&rsquo;t alone, however. He was sat around a table, an older man who she recognised as the man that walked Helen down the aisle, along with several other men in tuxedos who she assumed to be part of Matthew&rsquo;s family. John wore that smouldering gaze again, jaw clenched as he sat up straight, a behaviour he displayed when he got defensive, professionally that is. She guessed they were grilling him about his life currently, post-Helen. Y/N worked quickly to make her way to him, taking long, confident strides towards him, though his back was towards her from this angle. </p><p>She got closer, her heels loud enough to give John a heads up that it was her and not someone sneaking up on him. She bent down, wrapping her arms around him in a soft embrace as part of her &lsquo;<i>mission: save John</i>&rsquo;, pressing a small kiss against his cheek. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I was gone so long, <i>sweetie</i>. I got lost on my way there and then I got a phone call from Will, you know the one from project management about the recent research conducted out on the Ligand binding assay and he just kept waffling, bless him&mdash;oh my gosh, I&rsquo;m so sorry for interrupting! Where are my manners? Hi, I&rsquo;m Y/N, <i>John&rsquo;s girlfriend</i>. So nice to meet you all&rdquo;. They all sat with their eyes practically bulging out of their sockets, mouths agape but Y/N wasn&rsquo;t sure whether it was her waffling about some weird pharma model or if she&rsquo;d just grown an extra head. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s okay, <i>love</i>. Me and the guys here were just having a friendly conversation on just how lucky I&rsquo;ve been to have such a <i>wonderful</i> woman like you in my life. I hope everything&rsquo;s okay with Will?&rdquo;, John replied back, going along with the act you started. </p><p>&ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s fine with Will, he just wanted to clarify some details with me about our next research project. And, stop it you. <i><b>I&rsquo;m</b></i> the lucky one, Jonathan Wick. You best have played nice with the <i>boys</i> here&rdquo;, she said, applying some emphasis on the word &lsquo;boys&rsquo; as she turned to look at the other faces surrounding the table, letting her hands roam John&rsquo;s chest as she lightly padded her fingers across his stiff torso. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate to do this, but I need to borrow my dear, John here. You take care of yourselves, boys.&rdquo;, she finished a John bid them all a &lsquo;good evening&rsquo; as he got up from the table, and much to Y/N&rsquo;s surprise, wrapped his arm around her waist. Y/N made sure to swing her hips a little as she strutted away from them, a grin plastered to her face as people moved out of their way, parting like Noah and the Red Sea. &ldquo;You were right, a princess and an assassin do make a great duo&rdquo;. </p><p>&ldquo;Or maybe it&rsquo;s just us&rdquo;, he murmured back, feeling the effect of Y/N dig into his soul, clouding any other thought apart from her hands roaming his chest. &ldquo;Thanks for saving me back there, those assholes wouldn&rsquo;t drop the whole &lsquo;<i>so tell us how shit your life is now without Helen</i>&rsquo;, not in those exact words but close enough&rdquo;. </p><p>&ldquo;It was worth it to see all their dumb faces so shook. They need to do something better with their lives asap&rdquo;. </p><p>They were close approaching the dance floor, and a familiar midtempo love ballad that Y/N knew all too well began to play. Grabbing his hand, she tugged him towards the dance floor. &ldquo;Can we have this one dance, please? This is one of my favourite songs ever&rdquo;, she quietly asked, wide eyes staring up at him with such adoration that he couldn&rsquo;t say no. Wrapping his arms around her waist, she did the same with hers wrapping around his neck, bringing his head down closer to hers. Y/N softly sang the words to the song into his ear, &ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;ll trade your broken wings for mine, I&rsquo;ve seen your scars and kissed your crimes</i>&rdquo;, John immediately relaxed into her, her soft voice along with the lyrics and beautiful taking a toll. &ldquo;<i>Sweet love all night long, all I wanna, ain&rsquo;t no other, we together, I remember, sweet love all night long</i>&rdquo;. Y/N moved her face from his shoulder, making John gaze into her heavenly eyes again as she sang, &ldquo;<i>they say true love&rsquo;s the greatest weapon, to win the war caused by pain, but every diamond has imperfections, but my love&rsquo;s too pure to watch it chip away</i>&rdquo;. </p><p>Y/N could feel her eyes build with water, her feelings towards John too overwhelming to push away any longer. John felt it too, the ache of his heart longing to have Y/N. They both couldn&rsquo;t do it anymore. The song was nearing its end, and John whispered, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t want this, then move away now&rdquo;. When he saw her still standing there, he made his move. He slowly leaned in, close enough to feel her breath against his mouth before Y/N finally closed the gap between them. The kiss was passionate and had no rush to it, both of them savouring the taste of each other. They had both waited <i>three</i> years for this to happen, and here it was. And boy, did it feel <i>good</i>. Their mouths moved in sync with one another before Y/N had to move away and gasp for oxygen . The song came to a gentle stop as another started playing, eyes were glued to John and Y/N staring in wonder at the moment they&rsquo;d just shared. They hadn&rsquo;t noticed Helen&rsquo;s eyes on them too, watching on as warmth filled her heart to see John finally with someone that made him feel as though the sun was something built for him in a tool shed. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve waited three damn years for that, Wick, and it was so <i>damn</i> worth it.&rdquo;, Y/N admitted, as she brought her fingers up to his lips to wipe her lipstick off of them.</p><p>&ldquo;I know, because so have I&rdquo;. Y/N released a big yawn, the food, slow music and waking up at 5am aiding her into a tired state. &ldquo;Someone looks tired. Come on, let&rsquo;s go home&rdquo;. Y/N attempted to argue against him but then thoughts of better things happening outside of this place goaded her into agreeing with him and letting him win the battle of whether to stay or leave. John retrieved his car from the valet, opening the door one last time for Y/N to hop in as he did the same. Y/N undid her heels and slid them off her sore feet, sighing in relief at the feeling no longer having her feet encaged in a torture machine.</p><p>They both drove in a blissful silence, quiet music filling the atmosphere, creating a safe space for the both of them. The clear roads meant that they arrived back at Y/N&rsquo;s place faster than it would&rsquo;ve usually taken. </p><p>&ldquo;I really enjoyed today, thank you for bringing me as your plus one and allowing me to live my guilty pleasure of being a princess for one day in my life, Prince Charming&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;If I had known today would&rsquo;ve gone the way it did, I would&rsquo;ve never contemplated not going. Thank you for coming with me, I don&rsquo;t know how I would have survived the day without your presence&rdquo;. Y/N looked hesitantly at him, worried if her next words would make or break their current relationship for good but she had to try. </p><p>&ldquo;John, I&rsquo;ve been meaning to tell you something for a really long time now but I never knew if you&rsquo;d feel the same way so I never did because I didn&rsquo;t want to lose you.&rdquo;, she started as John listened intently to her words, his brow slightly furrowed. &ldquo;<i>I really like you</i>, John Wick. I&rsquo;ve liked you for a really long time now and I&rsquo;ve been bursting at the seams to tell y&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>I really like you too</i>, Y/N. Fuck, you&rsquo;ve been <i>driving me up a wall</i> since the first day we properly met. And your hijinks today? Sitting on my lap in the photobooth? Kissing my cheek? All the suggestive things you said? Calling me your boyfriend the whole day? Rubbing your hands up and down my chest? And don&rsquo;t think I didn&rsquo;t notice the way you swayed those fucking <i>gorgeous</i> hips.&rdquo;. &lsquo;So he did notice all these little things&rsquo;, she thought to herself, feeling her pride build up as that knot in her stomach returned. Y/N undid her seatbelt and climbed over quickly, but carefully, to John&rsquo;s seat, straddling his lap. </p><p>&ldquo;I <i>need</i> you so badly, John&rdquo;, she said in a hushed tone as she sat herself down on his lap, her burning hot core against his clothed member, John&rsquo;s eyes beginning to cloud with the same lust that filled Y/N&rsquo;s eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;Tell me what you want me to do to you&rdquo;, John&rsquo;s voice rumbled in a low tone, a tone he&rsquo;d only ever used when out on his &lsquo;business ventures&rsquo; but it made the sweet girl on his lap even wetter, feeling a wet spot forming over the crotch of his trousers from it soaking through her panties. </p><p>&ldquo;I want you to fuck me. I <i>need</i> you to <i>fuck</i> me. I <i>need</i> to feel you inside of me, please John, <i>please fuck me</i>&rdquo;, she moaned, looking at him with pleading eyes, instantly making John hard against her. Pulling the straps of her dress down, she revealed the blue bra she chose to wear in case this did happen. Unfastening her bra, she threw it over to the passenger seat as John responded with a low moan at the sight of her beautiful breasts. </p><p>Reaching out, the calloused padding of his hands cupped her perfect, smooth breasts, fondling them with extra care as Y/N bit her lip to prevent a moan from escaping her mouth. He moved his fingers to her hardened nipples and used his index finger and thumb to gently roll the peaks between them, tugging slightly at them as he watched the girl in front of him become undone. Leaning forward, he brought his lips to her breasts, covering them each in small, subtle kisses and then moving his attention back to her nipples again, running his tongue up against them, the air now hitting her peaks becoming cold, making Y/N delve in the sensitivity it brought about. Sensing that the cold air was increasing her sensitivity, John purposely blew air from out of his mouth against her stiffened peaks. &ldquo;Does that feel good, <i>princess</i>?&rdquo;, the man beneath her asked, Y/N&rsquo;s heart fluttering at the pet name he adopted for her. Nodding furiously, she tried to reply with a &lsquo;yes&rsquo; until the &lsquo;yes&rsquo; stretched out into a melodious moan. Y/N dug her hips against his, savouring the friction caused by the layers of fabric between them, moving her hips back and forth over his hard on, producing a gruff moan elicited by the boogeyman himself. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, John, please I-I can&rsquo;t&mdash;I need you inside me. <i>Please</i>.&rdquo;, her begs filled the space within the car. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, wait. Are you sure you want this?&rdquo;, bringing his fingers to her chin, making her look into his lovesick, chocolate eyes. &ldquo;I need to hear it from you one last time&rdquo;. Moving her face closer to his, mere <i>centimetres</i> away from touching his lips, she whispered the words &lsquo;<i>I want this, John.</i> I&rsquo;m sure&rsquo;. And with that, John worked quick to unbuckle his belt, &ldquo;I just need you to lift yourself up a little so I can get these pants down, be careful, wouldn&rsquo;t want my princess to hit her poor head against the roof of the car. If we&rsquo;re going to do this, I need you awake, unless you&rsquo;re into that sort of thing&rdquo;, the last bit making Y/N giggle.</p><p>&ldquo;You know me so well, and the worst part is even with your little warning about hitting my head against the roof of the car, I&rsquo;d <i>still</i> do it&rdquo;, lifting herself up slightly, enough for John to shuffle his clothing down and freeing his member. Y/N&rsquo;s eyes immediately glued to the throbbing, hard length in front of her eyes. The tip was leaking precum and the veins were prominent, a large one on the underside of his thick length. Without hesitation, she leaned forward moving her dress out the way by lifting it and bundling it around her waist, sliding her soaked panties to the side and pressing her hands against his shoulders as support as she lowered herself down onto his large cock. </p><p>John hissed as he felt his cock being embraced by tight, wet walls clenching down on him, the beautiful girl in front of him gasping with her mouth wide open, averting his gaze from her and down to where her eyes were fastened to, moaning as they watched his cock <i>disappear</i> deep inside of her tight hole. There was something so intimate about watching the way she bounced up and down, the way her mouth was ajar, prompting the symphony of moans and gasps and cries to slide past those flawless, plump lips. John could practically see the ripples of pleasure wave through her, passing like electrical current within a parallel circuit, pleasure reaching every inch of her deprived body. </p><p>&ldquo;Fuck&mdash;Y/N you feel so fucking good. You&rsquo;re fucking me so well, <i>princess</i>&rdquo;, praising her through gritted teeth, he moved one of his hands down to her clit, beginning to rub little circles over it, causing Y/N to squeal, the overwhelming pleasure causing her body to buck into John&rsquo;s, making her rest her head against the junction between his neck and shoulder, mewling into his ear provoking John to fuck up into her, gripping her hips harshly. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh god, John&rdquo;, she breathed, lifting her face to look him in the eyes with her own E/C ones that had started to brim with tears as the need for release became too much. The windows of the car had long steamed up, shielding others from the sin that they were currently indulging in. John was hitting her g spot, over and over as he thrust his hips up against her, rewarded with a whine in return of his action. &ldquo;Please&hellip; <i>please</i> John, I can&rsquo;t hold it for much longer, please let me cum&rdquo;. </p><p>Also nearing his own orgasm, John dug his fingers further into the plush flesh around her hips, making sure they&rsquo;d leave bruises for her to wake up to the next day, his thrusts becoming sloppier and more lax and his breathing ragged and increasingly desperate. &ldquo;Yeah&hellip; come on <i>princess</i>, cum for me. Cum all over my cock, do it sweetheart&rdquo;, he instructed as he tried coaxing her orgasm out, feeling her tremble as she teetered over the edge, finally reaching sweet release with a cry, letting her head roll onto his shoulders as she fell apart in his lap. John delved in the feeling of her tight pussy clenching around him, ushering him to reach his own climax with one final thrust, exploding deep inside of her with a deep growl, holding her hips down in place so all of him was buried inside her. Heavy breathing filled the car, along with the whimpers that fell from Y/N&rsquo;s throat, triggering John to move his hands to her back, gently rubbing circles against it to aid her in coming down from her high. </p><p>A few moments had passed, both of them sat in the same position as their senses slowly returned to them as John was still buried inside Y/N, a thin sheen of sweat covering the both of them. Giving it all her energy, she lift her head up, meeting John&rsquo;s eyes as she rest her forehead against his. &ldquo;<i>Wow</i>&rdquo;, he murmured as that all too familiar smile of hers returned on her face.</p><p>&ldquo;You know, I&rsquo;ve waited three years for this and it finally happened, albeit in your car, but it still happened&rdquo;. Now it was John&rsquo;s turn to smile as he leaned in and kissed her one final time. Sliding herself off of him, she slid her panties back over her core, honestly not minding that her favourite set had been ruined with their filth as she grabbed her bra from her seat, moving it so she could sit herself back and off of John&rsquo;s lap, much to her internal conflict against doing so. She didn&rsquo;t even bother putting the bra back on, simply placing it on her lap as John pulled his trousers back up and buckled his belt up again. &ldquo;Thank you for such a wonderful day, Jonathan. I think this has probably taken the top spot for the best day of my life&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;No, thank you for coming with me today. Thank you for agreeing to be my plus one and making this the best day of <i>my</i> life.&rdquo;, John replied as he brought her hand to his mouth a placed a loving kiss against her knuckles. </p><p><b>&ldquo;We really do make a pretty good badass princess-assassin duo, hm?&rdquo;.</b></p></p>",

This is a place to discuss news and anticipation for upcoming DCEU projects as well as express appreciation for the already existing stories and films we have come to love produced by DC. Marvel fans are welcome to follow just as long as they are civil and respectful towards us. This is a DC fanblog, and while we may offer constructive criticism to what we love, we will not tolerate nonconstructive criticism that only serves to attempt to make what we love less enjoyable. We get enough of that outside of this blog, so we will not tolerate it here.This blog is also ran by a queer Black intersectional feminist.BEFORE YOU FOLLOW, KNOW THIS: I do make posts that discuss and call out fandom racism. I will not sugar coat anything on the subject.",

This is a place to discuss news and anticipation for upcoming DCEU projects as well as express appreciation for the already existing stories and films we have come to love produced by DC. Marvel fans are welcome to follow just as long as they are civil and respectful towards us. This is a DC fanblog, and while we may offer constructive criticism to what we love, we will not tolerate nonconstructive criticism that only serves to attempt to make what we love less enjoyable. We get enough of that outside of this blog, so we will not tolerate it here.This blog is also ran by a queer Black intersectional feminist.BEFORE YOU FOLLOW, KNOW THIS: I do make posts that discuss and call out fandom racism. I will not sugar coat anything on the subject.",
