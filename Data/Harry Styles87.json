Kate xxx</b></i></p><p>A weekend away to Anne\u2019s had seemed like the perfect idea when Harry had first suggested it. You both needed some time away, to relax and recover because you were both feeling a little overworked.</p><p>It\u2019s been a hectic few months to say the least, with your own family seemingly trying to reek havoc in your life at every opportunity, you tend to lean into Harry\u2019s family more because they\u2019re more understanding. Your family don\u2019t dislike Harry, no that\u2019s not it. It\u2019s more that they seem to think he\u2019s a sort of toy, a shiny object to be shown off in front of other people. It\u2019s more like a \u2018look who our daughter managed to bag as her boyfriend\u2019.</p><!-- more --><p>And you\u2019d rather keep Harry away from that, because it\u2019s the last thing he needs from anyone. He always says he doesn\u2019t mind, but you mind. You love him, probably a bit too much, besotted being a more appropriate term. You love him with everything you have. Honestly, you\u2019re surprised he\u2019s not ran a hundred miles in the opposite direction. But he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cOh I can\u2019t wait to see you two get married one day.\u201d Anne sighs contentedly after dinner, gazing across the table at you with a warmth you don\u2019t think you\u2019ve seen even from your own mother.</p><p>You evidently stiffen in your seat, Harry\u2019s hand immediately clapping to your thigh as reassurance. You hate that you have to react this way, because as you\u2019ve already mentioned you love the man with your whole ass fucking heart. But Anne doesn\u2019t know if your insecurities to really commit. She doesn\u2019t know that Harry\u2019s already proposed once, with a ring and everything, and you said \u2018no\u2019. You said no because you\u2019re terrified of failure. It\u2019s not the marriage side of it, it\u2019s the fact that in the future everything might not be so perfect, and you and Harry might just fall out of love with you and\u2026 divorce you. He maintains that he won\u2019t regularly, but he can\u2019t see into the future so how would he know?</p><p>Your entire life you\u2019ve been surrounded by divorce, most people you know - their parents have divorced. You have friends who\u2019ve already married and divorced, why would you be any different?</p><p>Harry tries to brush off the subject with an awkward laugh and a gentle squeeze to your thigh. \u201cSteady on, Mum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell you\u2019ve been together nearly four years!\u201d Anne chuckles. \u201cPoor girl probably thinks you don\u2019t want to marry her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe already asked.\u201d You blurt, unable to look either of them in the eye all of a sudden. You\u2019re hot with anxiety, you can already feel the panic starting to settle into the back of your neck. \u201cHe already asked and I said \u2018no\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Anne confusedly blinks between the two of you, her brows slowly knitting together until they\u2019re one. \u201cYou proposed, Harry?\u201d She sounds hurt now, and that upsets you even more.</p><p>Harry swallows the lump in his throat. \u201cI did, yeah. Few months back.\u201d His voice is tight, ill with worry.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say anything?\u201d Anne\u2019s voice is soft, but still laced with a hurt that even you can\u2019t ignore.</p><p>\u201cWanted it to be a surprise.\u201d He shrugs, his tone verging on the point of sullen.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my fault, I\u2019m the one that said \u2018no\u2019.\u201d You stammer, wriggling in your seat as you continue to stare at the bend of the table.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not ready yet.\u201d Harry surmises, slipping his hand from your thigh to lock his fingers with yours, like a show of solidarity that\u2019s not really necessary. \u201cAnd I\u2019m okay with that.\u201d</p><p>As much as you appreciate Harry\u2019s understanding, the insinuation that you might be ready to marry in the future has your head spinning. Because what if you don\u2019t ever find yourself ready? What if you never overcome that fear of failure? What if you really do end up losing him? Maybe it\u2019d be safer to just end it..?</p><p>You quickly excuse yourself from the table before you break down in front of Harry and his mum, and flee to Harry\u2019s bedroom to hide your looming panic attack in there. The comfort of Harry\u2019s bedroom is simultaneously better and worse. Better because everything about him calms you, and the room is full of just him, even after years away from home his smell lingers on everything and it\u2019s so completely intoxicating. But it\u2019s worse because in your current frame of mind some of this may never be yours again, and that thought really has you sobbing.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Harry isn\u2019t too far behind you, closing the door with a click and falling to his knees where you\u2019re sat panting on the edge of the bed, \u201chey, I\u2019m sorry. Maybe I should\u2019ve told her, I didn\u2019t know she\u2019d react like that.\u201d</p><p>You shake your head as you attempt to fight the tears that now threaten behind your eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can do this, Harry.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s expression begins to mirror Anne\u2019s from moments earlier, confusion washing over him. \u201cWhat do you mean, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean I can\u2019t give you what you want and it\u2019s not fair.\u201d You\u2019re stressing over your words, your throat tight with every syllable you spit out.</p><p>\u201cAngel, don\u2019t do that.\u201d Harry begs, taking both hands in his. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, your entire family are sitting on the edge of their seats waiting for me to say \u2018yes\u2019 so they can yomp me down the aisle! And I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever be ready for that!\u201d Your voice has raised in volume, like you\u2019ve internally snapped and you\u2019ve had enough.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter!\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt does matter, Harry! It matters because regardless of the fact that we <i>barely</i> spoke about marriage before you proposed, it\u2019s the only thing I\u2019ve heard about since! And we\u2019ve been together long enough that people are going to find it weird!\u201d</p><p>Harry shakes his head, looking to the floor as he speaks. \u201cDo you really think I care what other people want? I was done doing that a long time ago, I don\u2019t intend to go back to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you do want a wife and a family, and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m the right person to give you that!\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s head snaps up, eyes brimming with wet tears. \u201cDon\u2019t do this, love. Please. If you\u2019re worried about your family, you know I don\u2019t mind them. If you never decide to marry me, I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d fucking love to have you as my wife, but I\u2019d also happily have just you without the title. I just need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thing is, Harry, I don\u2019t know if <i>just me</i> is enough. You deserve more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d He scolds with a near scowl, standing quickly with your hands still in his. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to just make this decision on your own! There\u2019s two of us in this relationship, you can\u2019t just throw away four years because you\u2019re scared!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you can\u2019t force me to stay in it either!\u201d You stand too, tearing your hands from his hold. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the one your family hates because I won\u2019t give you what you want!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove, for the last time, I only want you!\u201d</p><p>The last brick in your defensive wall is cracking, until it finally breaks and those tears you\u2019ve been fighting win their way through. You feel defeated, deflated and a little defenceless. You\u2019ve ran out of excuses to fight him with. You don\u2019t want to leave him, not at all. You realise that throwing away your relationship with Harry would be throwing away the best thing you\u2019ll ever have. And even if you do lose him in the future, there\u2019s no harm in enjoying him now.</p><p>His arms wrap around you as you break down, his hand running upwards from your neck into your soft hair to rub at your scalp. \u201cM\u2019not going anywhere, married or not.\u201d</p><p>~</p><p>With a heavy sigh Harry collapses into the armchair he always claims in his mum\u2019s home. You\u2019d cried for a little while, your tears collecting against the fabric of Harry\u2019s t-shirt until they stained, and he\u2019d coaxed you to lie down on his bed until you passed out sleeping.</p><p>No other words had been said between you since, just soft pecks to your face and hands every now and then as he held you. Even though you were crying, it was oddly relaxing.</p><p>\u201cIs that what she really thinks of us?\u201d Anne can\u2019t help her question as she idly pets the cat in her lap.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d Harry frowns over at her.</p><p>Anne grimaces slightly, like she\u2019s afraid to say the words out loud. \u201cDoes she really think we just want her married off to you?\u201d</p><p>Harry shakes his head with a deeper frown. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think she meant it like that. I think she meant you\u2019re obviously excited by the idea of us being married and she\u2019s just intimidated by it a little. She worships our family, especially you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realise she felt that way about it, I\u2019m a little surprised. Feel stupid for saying anything now.\u201d Anne worries, hating the feeling that she might\u2019ve upset you.</p><p>Harry sighs, rubbing his hand over his face. \u201cPlease don\u2019t worry yourself over it, she just panicked. She might be a little sheepish in the morning but I know she still adores you the same way. She\u2019s just terrified of disappointing everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt disappointed by her.\u201d Anne mutters.</p><p>\u201cMe neither.\u201d</p><p>~</p><p>You\u2019re apprehensive to say the least. Anne probably hates you after your rude exit from dinner followed by a screaming match with Harry. And you wouldn\u2019t blame her either, you kind of hate yourself anyway.</p><p>Harry has gone out for a run, which means it\u2019s just you and Anne in the house. Yay.</p><p>You awkwardly shuffle into the kitchen where Anne is making breakfast, and you\u2019re definitely surprised when she smiles at you. \u201cMorning, love. Just boiled the kettle if you want a tea or coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d You mumble, making your way to where you know the mugs to be.</p><p>\u201cAbout yesterday, love.\u201d Anne begins, and your heart skitters with panic. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I upset you, I didn\u2019t realise you weren\u2019t that comfortable with getting married.\u201d</p><p><i>Great, I\u2019ve made her feel bad.</i> You turn to face her with a solemn expression. \u201cNo I overreacted. It\u2019s perfectly normal for you to be excited about something like that but I just panicked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t see you any differently. Whether you\u2019re married to Harry or not you\u2019re still a part of our family.\u201d</p><p>Anne\u2019s kind words have somehow lifted everything off your shoulders, and you feel lighter now than you have done for months. Maybe one day you will find the confidence to marry the man you love, but right now you\u2019re happy to settle with the love of his family and his company.</p><p>~~~</p><p>Merci, loves \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95</p>",

You hate that you have to react this way, because as you\u2019ve already mentioned you love the man with your whole ass fucking heart. But Anne doesn\u2019t know if your insecurities to really commit. She doesn\u2019t know that Harry\u2019s already proposed once, with a ring and everything, and you said \u2018no\u2019. You said no because you\u2019re terrified of failure. It\u2019s not the marriage side of it, it\u2019s the fact that in the future everything might not be so perfect, and you and Harry might just fall out of love with you and\u2026 divorce you. He maintains that he won\u2019t regularly, but he can\u2019t see into the future so how would he know?</p><p>Your entire life you\u2019ve been surrounded by divorce, most people you know - their parents have divorced. You have friends who\u2019ve already married and divorced, why would you be any different?</p><p>Harry tries to brush off the subject with an awkward laugh and a gentle squeeze to your thigh. \u201cSteady on, Mum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell you\u2019ve been together nearly four years!\u201d Anne chuckles. \u201cPoor girl probably thinks you don\u2019t want to marry her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe already asked.\u201d You blurt, unable to look either of them in the eye all of a sudden. You\u2019re hot with anxiety, you can already feel the panic starting to settle into the back of your neck. \u201cHe already asked and I said \u2018no\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Anne confusedly blinks between the two of you, her brows slowly knitting together until they\u2019re one. \u201cYou proposed, Harry?\u201d She sounds hurt now, and that upsets you even more.</p><p>Harry swallows the lump in his throat. \u201cI did, yeah. Few months back.\u201d His voice is tight, ill with worry.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say anything?\u201d Anne\u2019s voice is soft, but still laced with a hurt that even you can\u2019t ignore.</p><p>\u201cWanted it to be a surprise.\u201d He shrugs, his tone verging on the point of sullen.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my fault, I\u2019m the one that said \u2018no\u2019.\u201d You stammer, wriggling in your seat as you continue to stare at the bend of the table.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not ready yet.\u201d Harry surmises, slipping his hand from your thigh to lock his fingers with yours, like a show of solidarity that\u2019s not really necessary. \u201cAnd I\u2019m okay with that.\u201d</p><p>As much as you appreciate Harry\u2019s understanding, the insinuation that you might be ready to marry in the future has your head spinning. Because what if you don\u2019t ever find yourself ready? What if you never overcome that fear of failure? What if you really do end up losing him? Maybe it\u2019d be safer to just end it..?</p><p>You quickly excuse yourself from the table before you break down in front of Harry and his mum, and flee to Harry\u2019s bedroom to hide your looming panic attack in there. The comfort of Harry\u2019s bedroom is simultaneously better and worse. Better because everything about him calms you, and the room is full of just him, even after years away from home his smell lingers on everything and it\u2019s so completely intoxicating. But it\u2019s worse because in your current frame of mind some of this may never be yours again, and that thought really has you sobbing.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Harry isn\u2019t too far behind you, closing the door with a click and falling to his knees where you\u2019re sat panting on the edge of the bed, \u201chey, I\u2019m sorry. Maybe I should\u2019ve told her, I didn\u2019t know she\u2019d react like that.\u201d</p><p>You shake your head as you attempt to fight the tears that now threaten behind your eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can do this, Harry.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s expression begins to mirror Anne\u2019s from moments earlier, confusion washing over him. \u201cWhat do you mean, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean I can\u2019t give you what you want and it\u2019s not fair.\u201d You\u2019re stressing over your words, your throat tight with every syllable you spit out.</p><p>\u201cAngel, don\u2019t do that.\u201d Harry begs, taking both hands in his. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, your entire family are sitting on the edge of their seats waiting for me to say \u2018yes\u2019 so they can yomp me down the aisle! And I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever be ready for that!\u201d Your voice has raised in volume, like you\u2019ve internally snapped and you\u2019ve had enough.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter!\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt does matter, Harry! It matters because regardless of the fact that we <i>barely</i> spoke about marriage before you proposed, it\u2019s the only thing I\u2019ve heard about since! And we\u2019ve been together long enough that people are going to find it weird!\u201d</p><p>Harry shakes his head, looking to the floor as he speaks. \u201cDo you really think I care what other people want? I was done doing that a long time ago, I don\u2019t intend to go back to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you do want a wife and a family, and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m the right person to give you that!\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s head snaps up, eyes brimming with wet tears. \u201cDon\u2019t do this, love. Please. If you\u2019re worried about your family, you know I don\u2019t mind them. If you never decide to marry me, I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d fucking love to have you as my wife, but I\u2019d also happily have just you without the title. I just need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thing is, Harry, I don\u2019t know if <i>just me</i> is enough. You deserve more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d He scolds with a near scowl, standing quickly with your hands still in his. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to just make this decision on your own! There\u2019s two of us in this relationship, you can\u2019t just throw away four years because you\u2019re scared!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you can\u2019t force me to stay in it either!\u201d You stand too, tearing your hands from his hold. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the one your family hates because I won\u2019t give you what you want!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove, for the last time, I only want you!\u201d</p><p>The last brick in your defensive wall is cracking, until it finally breaks and those tears you\u2019ve been fighting win their way through. You feel defeated, deflated and a little defenceless. You\u2019ve ran out of excuses to fight him with. You don\u2019t want to leave him, not at all. You realise that throwing away your relationship with Harry would be throwing away the best thing you\u2019ll ever have. And even if you do lose him in the future, there\u2019s no harm in enjoying him now.</p><p>His arms wrap around you as you break down, his hand running upwards from your neck into your soft hair to rub at your scalp. \u201cM\u2019not going anywhere, married or not.\u201d</p><p>~</p><p>With a heavy sigh Harry collapses into the armchair he always claims in his mum\u2019s home. You\u2019d cried for a little while, your tears collecting against the fabric of Harry\u2019s t-shirt until they stained, and he\u2019d coaxed you to lie down on his bed until you passed out sleeping.</p><p>No other words had been said between you since, just soft pecks to your face and hands every now and then as he held you. Even though you were crying, it was oddly relaxing.</p><p>\u201cIs that what she really thinks of us?\u201d Anne can\u2019t help her question as she idly pets the cat in her lap.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d Harry frowns over at her.</p><p>Anne grimaces slightly, like she\u2019s afraid to say the words out loud. \u201cDoes she really think we just want her married off to you?\u201d</p><p>Harry shakes his head with a deeper frown. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think she meant it like that. I think she meant you\u2019re obviously excited by the idea of us being married and she\u2019s just intimidated by it a little. She worships our family, especially you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realise she felt that way about it, I\u2019m a little surprised. Feel stupid for saying anything now.\u201d Anne worries, hating the feeling that she might\u2019ve upset you.</p><p>Harry sighs, rubbing his hand over his face. \u201cPlease don\u2019t worry yourself over it, she just panicked. She might be a little sheepish in the morning but I know she still adores you the same way. She\u2019s just terrified of disappointing everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt disappointed by her.\u201d Anne mutters.</p><p>\u201cMe neither.\u201d</p><p>~</p><p>You\u2019re apprehensive to say the least. Anne probably hates you after your rude exit from dinner followed by a screaming match with Harry. And you wouldn\u2019t blame her either, you kind of hate yourself anyway.</p><p>Harry has gone out for a run, which means it\u2019s just you and Anne in the house. Yay.</p><p>You awkwardly shuffle into the kitchen where Anne is making breakfast, and you\u2019re definitely surprised when she smiles at you. \u201cMorning, love. Just boiled the kettle if you want a tea or coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d You mumble, making your way to where you know the mugs to be.</p><p>\u201cAbout yesterday, love.\u201d Anne begins, and your heart skitters with panic. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I upset you, I didn\u2019t realise you weren\u2019t that comfortable with getting married.\u201d</p><p><i>Great, I\u2019ve made her feel bad.</i> You turn to face her with a solemn expression. \u201cNo I overreacted. It\u2019s perfectly normal for you to be excited about something like that but I just panicked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t see you any differently. Whether you\u2019re married to Harry or not you\u2019re still a part of our family.\u201d</p><p>Anne\u2019s kind words have somehow lifted everything off your shoulders, and you feel lighter now than you have done for months. Maybe one day you will find the confidence to marry the man you love, but right now you\u2019re happy to settle with the love of his family and his company.</p><p>~~~</p><p>Merci, loves \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95</p>",

Kate xxx</b></i></p><p>A weekend away to Anne\u2019s had seemed like the perfect idea when Harry had first suggested it. You both needed some time away, to relax and recover because you were both feeling a little overworked.</p><p>It\u2019s been a hectic few months to say the least, with your own family seemingly trying to reek havoc in your life at every opportunity, you tend to lean into Harry\u2019s family more because they\u2019re more understanding. Your family don\u2019t dislike Harry, no that\u2019s not it. It\u2019s more that they seem to think he\u2019s a sort of toy, a shiny object to be shown off in front of other people. It\u2019s more like a \u2018look who our daughter managed to bag as her boyfriend\u2019.</p>[[MORE]]<p>And you\u2019d rather keep Harry away from that, because it\u2019s the last thing he needs from anyone. He always says he doesn\u2019t mind, but you mind. You love him, probably a bit too much, besotted being a more appropriate term. You love him with everything you have. Honestly, you\u2019re surprised he\u2019s not ran a hundred miles in the opposite direction. But he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cOh I can\u2019t wait to see you two get married one day.\u201d Anne sighs contentedly after dinner, gazing across the table at you with a warmth you don\u2019t think you\u2019ve seen even from your own mother.</p><p>You evidently stiffen in your seat, Harry\u2019s hand immediately clapping to your thigh as reassurance.

Anne probably hates you after your rude exit from dinner followed by a screaming match with Harry. And you wouldn\u2019t blame her either, you kind of hate yourself anyway.</p><p>Harry has gone out for a run, which means it\u2019s just you and Anne in the house. Yay.</p><p>You awkwardly shuffle into the kitchen where Anne is making breakfast, and you\u2019re definitely surprised when she smiles at you. \u201cMorning, love. Just boiled the kettle if you want a tea or coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d You mumble, making your way to where you know the mugs to be.</p><p>\u201cAbout yesterday, love.\u201d Anne begins, and your heart skitters with panic. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I upset you, I didn\u2019t realise you weren\u2019t that comfortable with getting married.\u201d</p><p><i>Great, I\u2019ve made her feel bad.</i> You turn to face her with a solemn expression. \u201cNo I overreacted. It\u2019s perfectly normal for you to be excited about something like that but I just panicked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t see you any differently. Whether you\u2019re married to Harry or not you\u2019re still a part of our family.\u201d</p><p>Anne\u2019s kind words have somehow lifted everything off your shoulders, and you feel lighter now than you have done for months. Maybe one day you will find the confidence to marry the man you love, but right now you\u2019re happy to settle with the love of his family and his company.</p><p>~~~</p><p>Merci, loves \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95</p>",

I love your writing and I was wondering if you could write something where Y/N and Harry get in a big fight at Anne or Gemma&rsquo;s? And how his family member reacts or something like that? I really enjoyed your Miscarriage piece btw!!!! </p><p>-katie im hungry feed me more angst please thank you</p><p>-angst angst angst angst angst angst (i love you)</p><p><i><b>This is a combo of all of the above requests, the last two of which I&rsquo;m pretty sure are from <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mb5MZxMvKL3E9V-fzr16asg\">@talesofstyles</a> but I could be wrong&hellip; anyway, this is my last request of the weekend (yeet?) so later I&rsquo;m going to write the next thing for A Series of Parental Events &#128513; thoughts please! Kate xxx</b></i></p><p>A weekend away to Anne&rsquo;s had seemed like the perfect idea when Harry had first suggested it. You both needed some time away, to relax and recover because you were both feeling a little overworked.</p><p>It&rsquo;s been a hectic few months to say the least, with your own family seemingly trying to reek havoc in your life at every opportunity, you tend to lean into Harry&rsquo;s family more because they&rsquo;re more understanding. Your family don&rsquo;t dislike Harry, no that&rsquo;s not it. It&rsquo;s more that they seem to think he&rsquo;s a sort of toy, a shiny object to be shown off in front of other people. It&rsquo;s more like a &lsquo;look who our daughter managed to bag as her boyfriend&rsquo;.</p><p>And you&rsquo;d rather keep Harry away from that, because it&rsquo;s the last thing he needs from anyone. He always says he doesn&rsquo;t mind, but you mind. You love him, probably a bit too much, besotted being a more appropriate term. You love him with everything you have. Honestly, you&rsquo;re surprised he&rsquo;s not ran a hundred miles in the opposite direction. But he hadn&rsquo;t.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh I can&rsquo;t wait to see you two get married one day.&rdquo; Anne sighs contentedly after dinner, gazing across the table at you with a warmth you don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ve seen even from your own mother.</p><p>You evidently stiffen in your seat, Harry&rsquo;s hand immediately clapping to your thigh as reassurance. You hate that you have to react this way, because as you&rsquo;ve already mentioned you love the man with your whole ass fucking heart. But Anne doesn&rsquo;t know if your insecurities to really commit. She doesn&rsquo;t know that Harry&rsquo;s already proposed once, with a ring and everything, and you said &lsquo;no&rsquo;. You said no because you&rsquo;re terrified of failure. It&rsquo;s not the marriage side of it, it&rsquo;s the fact that in the future everything might not be so perfect, and you and Harry might just fall out of love with you and&hellip; divorce you. He maintains that he won&rsquo;t regularly, but he can&rsquo;t see into the future so how would he know?</p><p>Your entire life you&rsquo;ve been surrounded by divorce, most people you know - their parents have divorced. You have friends who&rsquo;ve already married and divorced, why would you be any different?</p><p>Harry tries to brush off the subject with an awkward laugh and a gentle squeeze to your thigh. &ldquo;Steady on, Mum.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well you&rsquo;ve been together nearly four years!&rdquo; Anne chuckles. &ldquo;Poor girl probably thinks you don&rsquo;t want to marry her!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He already asked.&rdquo; You blurt, unable to look either of them in the eye all of a sudden. You&rsquo;re hot with anxiety, you can already feel the panic starting to settle into the back of your neck. &ldquo;He already asked and I said &lsquo;no&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p>Anne confusedly blinks between the two of you, her brows slowly knitting together until they&rsquo;re one. &ldquo;You proposed, Harry?&rdquo; She sounds hurt now, and that upsets you even more.</p><p>Harry swallows the lump in his throat. &ldquo;I did, yeah. Few months back.&rdquo; His voice is tight, ill with worry.</p><p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you say anything?&rdquo; Anne&rsquo;s voice is soft, but still laced with a hurt that even you can&rsquo;t ignore.</p><p>&ldquo;Wanted it to be a surprise.&rdquo; He shrugs, his tone verging on the point of sullen.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my fault, I&rsquo;m the one that said &lsquo;no&rsquo;.&rdquo; You stammer, wriggling in your seat as you continue to stare at the bend of the table.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not ready yet.&rdquo; Harry surmises, slipping his hand from your thigh to lock his fingers with yours, like a show of solidarity that&rsquo;s not really necessary. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m okay with that.&rdquo;</p><p>As much as you appreciate Harry&rsquo;s understanding, the insinuation that you might be ready to marry in the future has your head spinning. Because what if you don&rsquo;t ever find yourself ready? What if you never overcome that fear of failure? What if you really do end up losing him? Maybe it&rsquo;d be safer to just end it..?</p><p>You quickly excuse yourself from the table before you break down in front of Harry and his mum, and flee to Harry&rsquo;s bedroom to hide your looming panic attack in there. The comfort of Harry&rsquo;s bedroom is simultaneously better and worse. Better because everything about him calms you, and the room is full of just him, even after years away from home his smell lingers on everything and it&rsquo;s so completely intoxicating. But it&rsquo;s worse because in your current frame of mind some of this may never be yours again, and that thought really has you sobbing.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; Harry isn&rsquo;t too far behind you, closing the door with a click and falling to his knees where you&rsquo;re sat panting on the edge of the bed, &ldquo;hey, I&rsquo;m sorry. Maybe I should&rsquo;ve told her, I didn&rsquo;t know she&rsquo;d react like that.&rdquo;</p><p>You shake your head as you attempt to fight the tears that now threaten behind your eyes. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if I can do this, Harry.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s expression begins to mirror Anne&rsquo;s from moments earlier, confusion washing over him. &ldquo;What do you mean, love?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I mean I can&rsquo;t give you what you want and it&rsquo;s not fair.&rdquo; You&rsquo;re stressing over your words, your throat tight with every syllable you spit out.</p><p>&ldquo;Angel, don&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo; Harry begs, taking both hands in his. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, your entire family are sitting on the edge of their seats waiting for me to say &lsquo;yes&rsquo; so they can yomp me down the aisle! And I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll ever be ready for that!&rdquo; Your voice has raised in volume, like you&rsquo;ve internally snapped and you&rsquo;ve had enough.</p><p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It does matter, Harry! It matters because regardless of the fact that we <i>barely</i> spoke about marriage before you proposed, it&rsquo;s the only thing I&rsquo;ve heard about since! And we&rsquo;ve been together long enough that people are going to find it weird!&rdquo;</p><p>Harry shakes his head, looking to the floor as he speaks. &ldquo;Do you really think I care what other people want? I was done doing that a long time ago, I don&rsquo;t intend to go back to it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you do want a wife and a family, and I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m the right person to give you that!&rdquo;</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s head snaps up, eyes brimming with wet tears. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do this, love. Please. If you&rsquo;re worried about your family, you know I don&rsquo;t mind them. If you never decide to marry me, I don&rsquo;t care. I&rsquo;d fucking love to have you as my wife, but I&rsquo;d also happily have just you without the title. I just need you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The thing is, Harry, I don&rsquo;t know if <i>just me</i> is enough. You deserve more.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Stop it!&rdquo; He scolds with a near scowl, standing quickly with your hands still in his. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get to just make this decision on your own! There&rsquo;s two of us in this relationship, you can&rsquo;t just throw away four years because you&rsquo;re scared!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And you can&rsquo;t force me to stay in it either!&rdquo; You stand too, tearing your hands from his hold. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be the one your family hates because I won&rsquo;t give you what you want!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Love, for the last time, I only want you!&rdquo;</p><p>The last brick in your defensive wall is cracking, until it finally breaks and those tears you&rsquo;ve been fighting win their way through. You feel defeated, deflated and a little defenceless. You&rsquo;ve ran out of excuses to fight him with. You don&rsquo;t want to leave him, not at all. You realise that throwing away your relationship with Harry would be throwing away the best thing you&rsquo;ll ever have. And even if you do lose him in the future, there&rsquo;s no harm in enjoying him now.</p><p>His arms wrap around you as you break down, his hand running upwards from your neck into your soft hair to rub at your scalp. &ldquo;M&rsquo;not going anywhere, married or not.&rdquo;</p><p>~</p><p>With a heavy sigh Harry collapses into the armchair he always claims in his mum&rsquo;s home.
