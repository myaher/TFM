The rain had finally ceased, and unrelenting constant over the past week. It was truly a beautiful day. Too bad Y/N and the rest of the avengers weren\u2019t enjoying it like normal humans. (Well, normal was a stretch when you had a god and super soldiers on the team.) </p><p>Y/N dove behind the nearest concrete barrier. Narrowly being missed when the expert marksman in his perch took his shot.</p><p>\u201cAh! Where the hell did you come from?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou good Y/N?\u201d Steve\u2019s slightly amused voice sounded in her ear. </p><p>She could see him crouched down behind a wall. He was some 200 feet away, with a worn out Sam sitting next to him. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m the one you should be worried about Steve. Is Sam good?\u201d</p><p>He nodded slightly and pressed a finger to his ear listening to the chatter on the comms. She had switched her own comm off a while ago, the damn bickering between the team giving her a headache. </p><p>Another shot ricocheted against the concrete barrier. Y/N yelped and tucked her head underneath her arms. \u201cShit!\u201d </p><p>She waited until the small fragments of concrete stopped falling before scooting herself down and hiding behind a taller barrier. They\u2019d been here for hours, and had yet to make any headway on their goal. God, why had she agreed to this? She could\u2019ve said no and stayed in bed. Oh, damn she missed her bed right now. And her shower. She had been rolling around in mud and other various things, she deserved a damn shower. She probably had grass and mud stains all over, ones that would take some serious work to get out. </p><p>Y/N looked back to Steve who was now pressing the gun back into Sam\u2019s hand. Slowly and as quickly as she could manage, Y/N crawled over to them hoping to devise a plan. </p><p>\u201cListen, I know you both want this over as much as I do&hellip; so I\u2019ve got a plan.\u201d They both looked at her with quizzical faces, and Y/N did what she could to hide her facial expressions. If she told either of them what she was planing, well let\u2019s just say she\u2019d be sent packing and Steve would have been sporting his disappointed dad look. </p><p>\u201cJust&hellip; follow my lead.\u201d Sam nodded and Steve raised a skeptical eyebrow. </p><p>\u201cY/N! Y/N! Where the hell are you going?!\u201d Steve whisper-yelled to her as she crawled away.</p><p>\u201cTo get Clint, duh.\u201d She stated like it was the most obvious option. \u201cOh and don\u2019t let me forget&hellip;\u201d she plastered a devious smile on her lips and raised her gun at the two her finger resting against the trigger. </p><p>Steve\u2019s eyes widened and Sam put his hands up in defense but it was no use. She pulled the trigger twice in succession and shot them both center mass. Right smack dab in the center of their sternums.  They looked at her with such disappointment she couldn\u2019t help but laugh. </p><p>\u201cPinks a good color for ya, Cap.\u201d Y/N shot them both a wink and ran away before they could return fire. </p><p>The two of them rolled their eyes at how much joy she had gotten from shooting them and sighed heavily. </p><p>\u201cWell I guess we are out now. Better head back.\u201d Sam stood with a groan and offered a hand to Steve. He was going to have a bruise on his chest tomorrow. Steve would as well but at least his would fade fairly fast. Him and his super serum. </p><p>\u201cRemind me to never play paintball with her again.\u201d Steve chuckled.</p><p>\u201cShe is just going to try and take out the one armed wonder. He was the one shooting at her.\u201d Sam clapped his hand down on Steve\u2019s shoulder. They knew the two of them were competitive but never thought that Y/N would sacrifice her own teammates to take down Bucky. Boy were they wrong. She\u2019d never turn on them in such a way in the real world, that much they knew. But on the paintball field there was no trust, not when she had a metal armed super soldier to take down. </p><p>\u2014</p><p>Clint swung around with each small noise. Most of the time it was nothing. A bird landing nearby, a small bug chirping, whatever it was Clint nearly jumped out of his skin. He had never been this anxious. On missions, sure he had nerves but he\u2019d never had them this bad. He was an Avenger for gods sake, he saved the world on the daily. And this? This was just team bonding, paintball against each other. He knew if this didn\u2019t end soon he\u2019d end up giving himself a heart attack. </p><p>He smirked seeing Natasha running for cover across the field. He\u2019d been fairly well hidden the whole time waiting for the right time to take his shot. No one from the other team even knew he was here, so the cover fire they laid down to protect her  was not aimed in his direction. He squeezed the trigger and watched the blue paint splash across Nat\u2019s thigh. </p><p>Leaves rustled and crunches under someone\u2019s heavy steps and Clint whipped himself around to find out the source of the noise.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>He stayed hyper vigilant, constantly scanning his surroundings. But he was no match for Y/N. He hadn\u2019t heard a noise for a minute or so, his heart beat finally calming down and he returned to watching the other Avengers take each other out.</p><p>Y/N\u2019s footfalls were completely silent as she snuck up behind Clint. She hadn\u2019t realized how much joy she could get sneaking up on the archer, or his reaction to realizing that he\u2019d been caught. His body went stiff, and Y/N could practically feel his blood freezing as she pressed the barrel of her gun against the back of his neck. </p><p>\u201cI know we are on the same team and all, but I\u2019ve got my own mission. They tell me you are the one who could help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith what?\u201d Clint still hadn\u2019t moved his body, to afraid to spook the girl and end up being shot.</p><p>\u201cMurder.\u201d She stated plainly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d He stood quickly, completely taken aback by her odd request. He didn\u2019t think she was serious about murdering a teammate but her tone of voice had left him with a couple questions.  And why did she come to him? Was he really the best person to go to if you wanted to murder someone?</p><p>Unfortunately, she had been expecting his quick reaction and her gun kept its place firmly planted to his skin as he rose, and her concentration never wavered. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just kidding! I just want to take Bucky on all by myself. So I need some information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d Clint questioned warily.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s still in?\u201d Her eyes were narrowed, constantly reading his face to check for deception. </p><p>\u201cJust Tony and Bucky on the other team. You and I on this team.\u201d The hold on his gun had relaxed, and Y/N took her chance. She swung her leg around to kick his gun out of his hands forcing him to the ground on his back. She smirked triumphantly and pointed her gun at his chest just as she had done with Steve and Sam.</p><p>\u201cLooks like it\u2019s just me now.\u201d She said pulling the trigger and painting the archer in a purple splash of paint. She squeezed the trigger once more and a green color splashed next the purple. It wasn\u2019t necessary to shoot him again, he\u2019d given her the information she needed, but she couldn\u2019t have loose ends. She looked him in the eye, and he noticed something akin to remorse flashing in her eyes. But as quickly as it showed in her eyes, it disappeared. And only mischief remained. </p><p>\u201cThey say I am a traitor\u2026 Maybe I am. All I know is I did what I had to do.\u201d She blew him a kiss laced with sarcasm. Was that possible? To sarcastically blow someone a kiss? </p><p>\u201cDamn. That was cruel. I like it!\u201d Clint gave a hearty laugh and bid her good luck  on her hunt, telling her the best way to get Tony. </p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for Y/N to take down Tony. The man was a fantastic fighter during his missions but let his guard down during this little exercise. She had snuck up behind him much like she had with Clint. This time she decided to be merciful, if you could even call it that. She dropped back from his position and climbed up a nearby tree. She had the shot lined up, and she laughed a little at herself. Should she take the shot right now she would hit Tony on the top of his ass. Right on his tailbone. </p><p>Y/N took a deep breath in, careful to keep her movements as silent as possible. Her finger moved from side of the gun down to the trigger. She held her breath for a moment and on her exhale slowly squeezed the trigger. However someone was on the other side of Tony was just a little bit faster than her. Just as she pulled the trigger, a splash of red paint and wood chips sprayed just to the side of Y/N\u2019s head. She yelped and flinched away. Unfortunately for Tony, her finger had already pulled the trigger. She heard a howl of pain and looked down to where Tony was crumpled in a heap on the ground. </p><p>When he had heard Y/N\u2019s yell, Tony had spun around unaware of her presence. He watched it in slow motion. He could see the small pellet was barreling towards him much to fast for his enjoyment, and where it was heading? Well that wasn\u2019t much better. </p><p>He collapsed unceremoniously onto the ground and screamed out as the paintball pelted him in his crotch. </p><p>The sounds of Bucky\u2019s muffled laugh and the louder laughter from those who were out and watching from the sidelines were barely heard over Tony\u2019s groans of pain. </p><p>Y/N apologized profusely, offering to help him up. He declined and waved her off mumbling that he wouldn\u2019t be getting up for awhile and an ice pack would be nice. </p><p>Clint ran over with some ice and handed it to Tony, who was still crumbled on the ground. Y/N had tried to apologize again but a warning shot from the soldier across the way had her returning her focus on her goal. He wanted a fight, otherwise he would have ended it and shot her right then and there. Shot her while her attention was elsewhere but he didn\u2019t. </p><p>\u201cThis is war, Barnes.\u201d Y/N growled, scanning her eye across the field until she found the light that glinted of the metal of his arm. </p><p>\u201cAre you going to fight the war? Or just stand there?\u201d He retorted.</p><p>She rolled her eyes, fighting the urge to provoke him further and darted behind a large concrete barrier as cover. She raised her gun and took a shot at where he\u2019d been only to find he was gone. She caught sight of him just as she turned and ducked  in time to miss the paint pellet flying towards her. </p><p>Y/N shot back, missing her mark by only centimeters. A blue splash of paint exploded near his head, and he let out a loud curse.</p><p>\u201cY/N, swing around the east side of the structure. If you climb up that side, he will never see you coming.\u201d Clint\u2019s voice sounded in her ear reminding her that she had help. </p><p>\u201cDamn, I didn\u2019t see that. Thanks.\u201d She whispered. She knew if she wanted to win this she had to play a little dirty. So she did what she knew best and created a illusion of herself to throw him off until she could get into place. </p><p>Y/N ran around to the east side of the building and started to climb. Damn that archer was smart. She had completely missed seeing this and it was perfect. She watched as her illusion ran behind trees, ducking in and out of visible areas to help distract Bucky while she got into place. </p><p>She watched as he lined up his shot, and took a deep breath in and out before pulling the trigger. </p><p>He pulled back in surprise when the paint pellet soared right through her and hit the tree behind it and her illusion disappeared. </p><p>\u201cI lost her. Damnit! No magic!\u201d He growled , obviously listening to his teammates through his comm. </p><p>\u201cNow that wasn\u2019t in the rules, so yes magic.\u201d She mocked, throwing Bucky off by having her voice come at him from multiple directions. He whipped around after being able to determine the source of her voice, only to be met with a paint pellet to the ribs. </p><p>Cheers could be heard from the sidelines, well, just from Y/N\u2019s team. Bucky\u2019s team hung their heads low as they were now on kitchen duty for a month. </p><p>\u201cYou lost old man!\u201d She said triumphantly and jumped down to offer a hand to help him up.</p><p>\u201cYeah, let\u2019s just see if you\u2019ll still be calling me an old man after tonight.\u201d </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"96\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/49d4acbb48dc612ed711188926b17fda/tumblr_pd8dtvhOH21ticqtz_1280.png\" data-orig-height=\"96\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"/></figure><p>Let me know if you enjoyed this by leaving a comment or reblog! \u2764\ufe0f</p><p>If you\u2019d like to be added to my tag list, shoot me an ask!</p><p>Tags: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTx48xjxYH65VPL48I4B2Rg\">@thoughtsofdarc</a> - <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mH1VmxgP16D6lxvSlpEDAng\">@startrekkingaroundasgard</a> - <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIjlEO2idhZFGzCd8s-pipg\">@babywerewolfninja</a> - <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTOPCjznxbJ6sltLkFkjjkw\">@teamcap4bucky</a> - <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBHunWzyPOagAbMCQf-7NuQ\">@sinceimetyou</a> - <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZfiNI1oMUhXtEbjTX6iKAg\">@abbyc212000</a> </p>",

The rain had finally ceased, and unrelenting constant over the past week. It was truly a beautiful day. Too bad Y/N and the rest of the avengers weren\u2019t enjoying it like normal humans. (Well, normal was a stretch when you had a god and super soldiers on the team.) </p><p>Y/N dove behind the nearest concrete barrier. Narrowly being missed when the expert marksman in his perch took his shot.</p><p>\u201cAh! Where the hell did you come from?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou good Y/N?\u201d Steve\u2019s slightly amused voice sounded in her ear. </p><p>She could see him crouched down behind a wall. He was some 200 feet away, with a worn out Sam sitting next to him. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m the one you should be worried about Steve. Is Sam good?\u201d</p><p>He nodded slightly and pressed a finger to his ear listening to the chatter on the comms. She had switched her own comm off a while ago, the damn bickering between the team giving her a headache. </p><p>Another shot ricocheted against the concrete barrier. Y/N yelped and tucked her head underneath her arms. \u201cShit!\u201d </p><p>She waited until the small fragments of concrete stopped falling before scooting herself down and hiding behind a taller barrier. They\u2019d been here for hours, and had yet to make any headway on their goal. God, why had she agreed to this? She could\u2019ve said no and stayed in bed. Oh, damn she missed her bed right now. And her shower. She had been rolling around in mud and other various things, she deserved a damn shower. She probably had grass and mud stains all over, ones that would take some serious work to get out. </p><p>Y/N looked back to Steve who was now pressing the gun back into Sam\u2019s hand. Slowly and as quickly as she could manage, Y/N crawled over to them hoping to devise a plan. </p><p>\u201cListen, I know you both want this over as much as I do\u2026 so I\u2019ve got a plan.\u201d They both looked at her with quizzical faces, and Y/N did what she could to hide her facial expressions. If she told either of them what she was planing, well let\u2019s just say she\u2019d be sent packing and Steve would have been sporting his disappointed dad look. </p><p>\u201cJust\u2026 follow my lead.\u201d Sam nodded and Steve raised a skeptical eyebrow. </p><p>\u201cY/N! Y/N! Where the hell are you going?!\u201d Steve whisper-yelled to her as she crawled away.</p><p>\u201cTo get Clint, duh.\u201d She stated like it was the most obvious option. \u201cOh and don\u2019t let me forget\u2026\u201d she plastered a devious smile on her lips and raised her gun at the two her finger resting against the trigger. </p><p>Steve\u2019s eyes widened and Sam put his hands up in defense but it was no use. She pulled the trigger twice in succession and shot them both center mass. Right smack dab in the center of their sternums.  They looked at her with such disappointment she couldn\u2019t help but laugh. </p><p>\u201cPinks a good color for ya, Cap.\u201d Y/N shot them both a wink and ran away before they could return fire. </p><p>The two of them rolled their eyes at how much joy she had gotten from shooting them and sighed heavily. </p><p>\u201cWell I guess we are out now. Better head back.\u201d Sam stood with a groan and offered a hand to Steve. He was going to have a bruise on his chest tomorrow. Steve would as well but at least his would fade fairly fast. Him and his super serum. </p><p>\u201cRemind me to never play paintball with her again.\u201d Steve chuckled.</p><p>\u201cShe is just going to try and take out the one armed wonder. He was the one shooting at her.\u201d Sam clapped his hand down on Steve\u2019s shoulder. They knew the two of them were competitive but never thought that Y/N would sacrifice her own teammates to take down Bucky. Boy were they wrong. She\u2019d never turn on them in such a way in the real world, that much they knew. But on the paintball field there was no trust, not when she had a metal armed super soldier to take down. </p><p>\u2014</p><p>Clint swung around with each small noise. Most of the time it was nothing. A bird landing nearby, a small bug chirping, whatever it was Clint nearly jumped out of his skin. He had never been this anxious. On missions, sure he had nerves but he\u2019d never had them this bad. He was an Avenger for gods sake, he saved the world on the daily. And this? This was just team bonding, paintball against each other. He knew if this didn\u2019t end soon he\u2019d end up giving himself a heart attack. </p><p>He smirked seeing Natasha running for cover across the field. He\u2019d been fairly well hidden the whole time waiting for the right time to take his shot. No one from the other team even knew he was here, so the cover fire they laid down to protect her  was not aimed in his direction. He squeezed the trigger and watched the blue paint splash across Nat\u2019s thigh. </p><p>Leaves rustled and crunches under someone\u2019s heavy steps and Clint whipped himself around to find out the source of the noise.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>He stayed hyper vigilant, constantly scanning his surroundings. But he was no match for Y/N. He hadn\u2019t heard a noise for a minute or so, his heart beat finally calming down and he returned to watching the other Avengers take each other out.</p><p>Y/N\u2019s footfalls were completely silent as she snuck up behind Clint. She hadn\u2019t realized how much joy she could get sneaking up on the archer, or his reaction to realizing that he\u2019d been caught. His body went stiff, and Y/N could practically feel his blood freezing as she pressed the barrel of her gun against the back of his neck. </p><p>\u201cI know we are on the same team and all, but I\u2019ve got my own mission. They tell me you are the one who could help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith what?\u201d Clint still hadn\u2019t moved his body, to afraid to spook the girl and end up being shot.</p><p>\u201cMurder.\u201d She stated plainly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d He stood quickly, completely taken aback by her odd request. He didn\u2019t think she was serious about murdering a teammate but her tone of voice had left him with a couple questions.  And why did she come to him? Was he really the best person to go to if you wanted to murder someone?</p><p>Unfortunately, she had been expecting his quick reaction and her gun kept its place firmly planted to his skin as he rose, and her concentration never wavered. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just kidding! I just want to take Bucky on all by myself. So I need some information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d Clint questioned warily.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s still in?\u201d Her eyes were narrowed, constantly reading his face to check for deception. </p><p>\u201cJust Tony and Bucky on the other team. You and I on this team.\u201d The hold on his gun had relaxed, and Y/N took her chance. She swung her leg around to kick his gun out of his hands forcing him to the ground on his back. She smirked triumphantly and pointed her gun at his chest just as she had done with Steve and Sam.</p><p>\u201cLooks like it\u2019s just me now.\u201d She said pulling the trigger and painting the archer in a purple splash of paint. She squeezed the trigger once more and a green color splashed next the purple. It wasn\u2019t necessary to shoot him again, he\u2019d given her the information she needed, but she couldn\u2019t have loose ends. She looked him in the eye, and he noticed something akin to remorse flashing in her eyes. But as quickly as it showed in her eyes, it disappeared. And only mischief remained. </p><p>\u201cThey say I am a traitor\u2026 Maybe I am. All I know is I did what I had to do.\u201d She blew him a kiss laced with sarcasm. Was that possible? To sarcastically blow someone a kiss? </p><p>\u201cDamn. That was cruel. I like it!\u201d Clint gave a hearty laugh and bid her good luck  on her hunt, telling her the best way to get Tony. </p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for Y/N to take down Tony. The man was a fantastic fighter during his missions but let his guard down during this little exercise. She had snuck up behind him much like she had with Clint. This time she decided to be merciful, if you could even call it that. She dropped back from his position and climbed up a nearby tree. She had the shot lined up, and she laughed a little at herself. Should she take the shot right now she would hit Tony on the top of his ass. Right on his tailbone. </p><p>Y/N took a deep breath in, careful to keep her movements as silent as possible. Her finger moved from side of the gun down to the trigger. She held her breath for a moment and on her exhale slowly squeezed the trigger. However someone was on the other side of Tony was just a little bit faster than her. Just as she pulled the trigger, a splash of red paint and wood chips sprayed just to the side of Y/N\u2019s head. She yelped and flinched away. Unfortunately for Tony, her finger had already pulled the trigger. She heard a howl of pain and looked down to where Tony was crumpled in a heap on the ground. </p><p>When he had heard Y/N\u2019s yell, Tony had spun around unaware of her presence. He watched it in slow motion. He could see the small pellet was barreling towards him much to fast for his enjoyment, and where it was heading? Well that wasn\u2019t much better. </p><p>He collapsed unceremoniously onto the ground and screamed out as the paintball pelted him in his crotch. </p><p>The sounds of Bucky\u2019s muffled laugh and the louder laughter from those who were out and watching from the sidelines were barely heard over Tony\u2019s groans of pain. </p><p>Y/N apologized profusely, offering to help him up. He declined and waved her off mumbling that he wouldn\u2019t be getting up for awhile and an ice pack would be nice. </p><p>Clint ran over with some ice and handed it to Tony, who was still crumbled on the ground. Y/N had tried to apologize again but a warning shot from the soldier across the way had her returning her focus on her goal. He wanted a fight, otherwise he would have ended it and shot her right then and there. Shot her while her attention was elsewhere but he didn\u2019t. </p><p>\u201cThis is war, Barnes.\u201d Y/N growled, scanning her eye across the field until she found the light that glinted of the metal of his arm. </p><p>\u201cAre you going to fight the war? Or just stand there?\u201d He retorted.</p><p>She rolled her eyes, fighting the urge to provoke him further and darted behind a large concrete barrier as cover. She raised her gun and took a shot at where he\u2019d been only to find he was gone. She caught sight of him just as she turned and ducked  in time to miss the paint pellet flying towards her. </p><p>Y/N shot back, missing her mark by only centimeters. A blue splash of paint exploded near his head, and he let out a loud curse.</p><p>\u201cY/N, swing around the east side of the structure. If you climb up that side, he will never see you coming.\u201d Clint\u2019s voice sounded in her ear reminding her that she had help. </p><p>\u201cDamn, I didn\u2019t see that.

He whipped around after being able to determine the source of her voice, only to be met with a paint pellet to the ribs. </p><p>Cheers could be heard from the sidelines, well, just from Y/N\u2019s team. Bucky\u2019s team hung their heads low as they were now on kitchen duty for a month. </p><p>\u201cYou lost old man!\u201d She said triumphantly and jumped down to offer a hand to help him up.</p><p>\u201cYeah, let\u2019s just see if you\u2019ll still be calling me an old man after tonight.\u201d </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"96\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/49d4acbb48dc612ed711188926b17fda/tumblr_pd8dtvhOH21ticqtz_1280.png\" data-orig-height=\"96\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"></figure><p>Let me know if you enjoyed this by leaving a comment or reblog! \u2764\ufe0f</p><p>If you\u2019d like to be added to my tag list, shoot me an ask!</p><p>Tags: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTx48xjxYH65VPL48I4B2Rg\">@thoughtsofdarc</a> - <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mH1VmxgP16D6lxvSlpEDAng\">@startrekkingaroundasgard</a> - <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIjlEO2idhZFGzCd8s-pipg\">@babywerewolfninja</a> - <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTOPCjznxbJ6sltLkFkjjkw\">@teamcap4bucky</a> - <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBHunWzyPOagAbMCQf-7NuQ\">@sinceimetyou</a> - <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZfiNI1oMUhXtEbjTX6iKAg\">@abbyc212000</a> </p></p>",

Slowly and as quickly as she could manage, Y/N crawled over to them hoping to devise a plan. </p><p>\u201cListen, I know you both want this over as much as I do\u2026 so I\u2019ve got a plan.\u201d They both looked at her with quizzical faces, and Y/N did what she could to hide her facial expressions. If she told either of them what she was planing, well let\u2019s just say she\u2019d be sent packing and Steve would have been sporting his disappointed dad look. </p><p>\u201cJust\u2026 follow my lead.\u201d Sam nodded and Steve raised a skeptical eyebrow. </p><p>\u201cY/N! Y/N! Where the hell are you going?!\u201d Steve whisper-yelled to her as she crawled away.</p><p>\u201cTo get Clint, duh.\u201d She stated like it was the most obvious option. \u201cOh and don\u2019t let me forget\u2026\u201d she plastered a devious smile on her lips and raised her gun at the two her finger resting against the trigger. </p><p>Steve\u2019s eyes widened and Sam put his hands up in defense but it was no use. She pulled the trigger twice in succession and shot them both center mass. Right smack dab in the center of their sternums.  They looked at her with such disappointment she couldn\u2019t help but laugh. </p><p>\u201cPinks a good color for ya, Cap.\u201d Y/N shot them both a wink and ran away before they could return fire. </p><p>The two of them rolled their eyes at how much joy she had gotten from shooting them and sighed heavily. </p><p>\u201cWell I guess we are out now. Better head back.\u201d Sam stood with a groan and offered a hand to Steve. He was going to have a bruise on his chest tomorrow. Steve would as well but at least his would fade fairly fast. Him and his super serum. </p><p>\u201cRemind me to never play paintball with her again.\u201d Steve chuckled.</p><p>\u201cShe is just going to try and take out the one armed wonder. He was the one shooting at her.\u201d Sam clapped his hand down on Steve\u2019s shoulder. They knew the two of them were competitive but never thought that Y/N would sacrifice her own teammates to take down Bucky. Boy were they wrong. She\u2019d never turn on them in such a way in the real world, that much they knew. But on the paintball field there was no trust, not when she had a metal armed super soldier to take down. </p><p>\u2014</p><p>Clint swung around with each small noise. Most of the time it was nothing. A bird landing nearby, a small bug chirping, whatever it was Clint nearly jumped out of his skin. He had never been this anxious. On missions, sure he had nerves but he\u2019d never had them this bad. He was an Avenger for gods sake, he saved the world on the daily. And this? This was just team bonding, paintball against each other. He knew if this didn\u2019t end soon he\u2019d end up giving himself a heart attack. </p><p>He smirked seeing Natasha running for cover across the field. He\u2019d been fairly well hidden the whole time waiting for the right time to take his shot. No one from the other team even knew he was here, so the cover fire they laid down to protect her  was not aimed in his direction. He squeezed the trigger and watched the blue paint splash across Nat\u2019s thigh. </p><p>Leaves rustled and crunches under someone\u2019s heavy steps and Clint whipped himself around to find out the source of the noise.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>He stayed hyper vigilant, constantly scanning his surroundings. But he was no match for Y/N. He hadn\u2019t heard a noise for a minute or so, his heart beat finally calming down and he returned to watching the other Avengers take each other out.</p><p>Y/N\u2019s footfalls were completely silent as she snuck up behind Clint. She hadn\u2019t realized how much joy she could get sneaking up on the archer, or his reaction to realizing that he\u2019d been caught. His body went stiff, and Y/N could practically feel his blood freezing as she pressed the barrel of her gun against the back of his neck. </p><p>\u201cI know we are on the same team and all, but I\u2019ve got my own mission. They tell me you are the one who could help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith what?\u201d Clint still hadn\u2019t moved his body, to afraid to spook the girl and end up being shot.</p><p>\u201cMurder.\u201d She stated plainly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d He stood quickly, completely taken aback by her odd request. He didn\u2019t think she was serious about murdering a teammate but her tone of voice had left him with a couple questions.  And why did she come to him? Was he really the best person to go to if you wanted to murder someone?</p><p>Unfortunately, she had been expecting his quick reaction and her gun kept its place firmly planted to his skin as he rose, and her concentration never wavered. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just kidding! I just want to take Bucky on all by myself. So I need some information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d Clint questioned warily.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s still in?\u201d Her eyes were narrowed, constantly reading his face to check for deception. </p><p>\u201cJust Tony and Bucky on the other team. You and I on this team.\u201d The hold on his gun had relaxed, and Y/N took her chance. She swung her leg around to kick his gun out of his hands forcing him to the ground on his back. She smirked triumphantly and pointed her gun at his chest just as she had done with Steve and Sam.</p><p>\u201cLooks like it\u2019s just me now.\u201d She said pulling the trigger and painting the archer in a purple splash of paint. She squeezed the trigger once more and a green color splashed next the purple. It wasn\u2019t necessary to shoot him again, he\u2019d given her the information she needed, but she couldn\u2019t have loose ends. She looked him in the eye, and he noticed something akin to remorse flashing in her eyes. But as quickly as it showed in her eyes, it disappeared. And only mischief remained. </p><p>\u201cThey say I am a traitor\u2026 Maybe I am. All I know is I did what I had to do.\u201d She blew him a kiss laced with sarcasm. Was that possible? To sarcastically blow someone a kiss? </p><p>\u201cDamn. That was cruel. I like it!\u201d Clint gave a hearty laugh and bid her good luck  on her hunt, telling her the best way to get Tony. </p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for Y/N to take down Tony. The man was a fantastic fighter during his missions but let his guard down during this little exercise. She had snuck up behind him much like she had with Clint. This time she decided to be merciful, if you could even call it that. She dropped back from his position and climbed up a nearby tree. She had the shot lined up, and she laughed a little at herself. Should she take the shot right now she would hit Tony on the top of his ass. Right on his tailbone. </p><p>Y/N took a deep breath in, careful to keep her movements as silent as possible. Her finger moved from side of the gun down to the trigger. She held her breath for a moment and on her exhale slowly squeezed the trigger. However someone was on the other side of Tony was just a little bit faster than her. Just as she pulled the trigger, a splash of red paint and wood chips sprayed just to the side of Y/N\u2019s head. She yelped and flinched away. Unfortunately for Tony, her finger had already pulled the trigger. She heard a howl of pain and looked down to where Tony was crumpled in a heap on the ground. </p><p>When he had heard Y/N\u2019s yell, Tony had spun around unaware of her presence. He watched it in slow motion. He could see the small pellet was barreling towards him much to fast for his enjoyment, and where it was heading? Well that wasn\u2019t much better. </p><p>He collapsed unceremoniously onto the ground and screamed out as the paintball pelted him in his crotch. </p><p>The sounds of Bucky\u2019s muffled laugh and the louder laughter from those who were out and watching from the sidelines were barely heard over Tony\u2019s groans of pain. </p><p>Y/N apologized profusely, offering to help him up. He declined and waved her off mumbling that he wouldn\u2019t be getting up for awhile and an ice pack would be nice. </p><p>Clint ran over with some ice and handed it to Tony, who was still crumbled on the ground. Y/N had tried to apologize again but a warning shot from the soldier across the way had her returning her focus on her goal. He wanted a fight, otherwise he would have ended it and shot her right then and there. Shot her while her attention was elsewhere but he didn\u2019t. </p><p>\u201cThis is war, Barnes.\u201d Y/N growled, scanning her eye across the field until she found the light that glinted of the metal of his arm. </p><p>\u201cAre you going to fight the war? Or just stand there?\u201d He retorted.</p><p>She rolled her eyes, fighting the urge to provoke him further and darted behind a large concrete barrier as cover. She raised her gun and took a shot at where he\u2019d been only to find he was gone. She caught sight of him just as she turned and ducked  in time to miss the paint pellet flying towards her. </p><p>Y/N shot back, missing her mark by only centimeters. A blue splash of paint exploded near his head, and he let out a loud curse.</p><p>\u201cY/N, swing around the east side of the structure. If you climb up that side, he will never see you coming.\u201d Clint\u2019s voice sounded in her ear reminding her that she had help. </p><p>\u201cDamn, I didn\u2019t see that. Thanks.\u201d She whispered. She knew if she wanted to win this she had to play a little dirty. So she did what she knew best and created a illusion of herself to throw him off until she could get into place. </p><p>Y/N ran around to the east side of the building and started to climb. Damn that archer was smart. She had completely missed seeing this and it was perfect. She watched as her illusion ran behind trees, ducking in and out of visible areas to help distract Bucky while she got into place. </p><p>She watched as he lined up his shot, and took a deep breath in and out before pulling the trigger. </p><p>He pulled back in surprise when the paint pellet soared right through her and hit the tree behind it and her illusion disappeared. </p><p>\u201cI lost her. Damnit! No magic!\u201d He growled , obviously listening to his teammates through his comm. </p><p>\u201cNow that wasn\u2019t in the rules, so yes magic.\u201d She mocked, throwing Bucky off by having her voice come at him from multiple directions. He whipped around after being able to determine the source of her voice, only to be met with a paint pellet to the ribs. </p><p>Cheers could be heard from the sidelines, well, just from Y/N\u2019s team. Bucky\u2019s team hung their heads low as they were now on kitchen duty for a month. </p><p>\u201cYou lost old man!\u201d She said triumphantly and jumped down to offer a hand to help him up.</p><p>\u201cYeah, let\u2019s just see if you\u2019ll still be calling me an old man after tonight.\u201d </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"96\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/49d4acbb48dc612ed711188926b17fda/tumblr_pd8dtvhOH21ticqtz_1280.png\" data-orig-height=\"96\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"></figure><p>Let me know if you enjoyed this by leaving a comment or reblog! \u2764\ufe0f</p><p>If you\u2019d like to be added to my tag list, shoot me an ask!</p><p>Tags: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTx48xjxYH65VPL48I4B2Rg\">@thoughtsofdarc</a> - <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mH1VmxgP16D6lxvSlpEDAng\">@startrekkingaroundasgard</a> - <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIjlEO2idhZFGzCd8s-pipg\">@babywerewolfninja</a> - <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTOPCjznxbJ6sltLkFkjjkw\">@teamcap4bucky</a> - <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBHunWzyPOagAbMCQf-7NuQ\">@sinceimetyou</a> - <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZfiNI1oMUhXtEbjTX6iKAg\">@abbyc212000</a> </p></p>",

Murder.</p><p>I lost her.</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>The sun was shining brightly with not a cloud in sight. The rain had finally ceased, and unrelenting constant over the past week. It was truly a beautiful day. Too bad Y/N and the rest of the avengers weren&rsquo;t enjoying it like normal humans. (Well, normal was a stretch when you had a god and super soldiers on the team.) </p><p>Y/N dove behind the nearest concrete barrier. Narrowly being missed when the expert marksman in his perch took his shot.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! Where the hell did you come from?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You good Y/N?&rdquo; Steve&rsquo;s slightly amused voice sounded in her ear. </p><p>She could see him crouched down behind a wall. He was some 200 feet away, with a worn out Sam sitting next to him. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m the one you should be worried about Steve. Is Sam good?&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded slightly and pressed a finger to his ear listening to the chatter on the comms. She had switched her own comm off a while ago, the damn bickering between the team giving her a headache. </p><p>Another shot ricocheted against the concrete barrier. Y/N yelped and tucked her head underneath her arms. &ldquo;Shit!&rdquo; </p><p>She waited until the small fragments of concrete stopped falling before scooting herself down and hiding behind a taller barrier. They&rsquo;d been here for hours, and had yet to make any headway on their goal. God, why had she agreed to this? She could&rsquo;ve said no and stayed in bed. Oh, damn she missed her bed right now. And her shower. She had been rolling around in mud and other various things, she deserved a damn shower. She probably had grass and mud stains all over, ones that would take some serious work to get out. </p><p>Y/N looked back to Steve who was now pressing the gun back into Sam&rsquo;s hand. Slowly and as quickly as she could manage, Y/N crawled over to them hoping to devise a plan. </p><p>&ldquo;Listen, I know you both want this over as much as I do&hellip; so I&rsquo;ve got a plan.&rdquo; They both looked at her with quizzical faces, and Y/N did what she could to hide her facial expressions.

She pulled the trigger twice in succession and shot them both center mass. Right smack dab in the center of their sternums.

With another snap of my fingers you will disintegrate like your friends, and your world will be left defenseless. Is that what you want?&rdquo; </p><p>No one spoke a word, knowing that he was right. They were foolish to try and defeat the man who had ended the lives of trillions with a simple action. The group was lost. They didn&rsquo;t know whether to retreat or if they should stay and at least <i>try</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what\u2014&rdquo;</p><p>Thanos was interrupted when a figure emerged from the west tree lines with a spear(1) in her left hand. The female radiated power and energy, just as the gauntlet with the infinity stones. She stepped towards the purple villain with confidence, the exact opposite of what she felt. She felt hurt, betrayed, and angered. The three feelings that seem to last longer than any other in her life. </p><p>&ldquo;Thanos.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, what are you doing here? You were meant to be in&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In Nusquam, on the other side of the universe. Yeah, I know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then why are you here Y/N?&rdquo; Thanos asked the girl whom he had come to have a soft spot for. He never meant to love the girl as he loved Gamora, but when he found her, <i>listened </i>to her, he knew that they were alike. Having lost everything, despite trying their damndest to hold on. To being betrayed by those they loved. The decade that Y/N was absent, she spent with Thanos. She knew of his plans and confronted him about it. He had promised that he wouldn&rsquo;t. So, he kept her in the dark about it all. After he sent her to Nusquam, he set out to find the stones. He had sacrificed one daughter, he wasn&rsquo;t going to sacrifice this one as well. </p><p>&ldquo;I came for them Thanos. I came to the knowledge of what you succeeded in doing to the planets. Thanos, you promised you wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Y/N pleaded with the man. She didn&rsquo;t want to fight him. She didn&rsquo;t want to lose another person in her life, but trillions of lives depended on this.</p><p>The group of heroes looked at the duo with confused looks. <i>Y/N knew Thanos? She meant something to him? </i>They were confused as to how and why, most of all Loki, Y/N&rsquo;s ex-husband. He didn&rsquo;t know that she had found comfort in the arms of their mortal enemy. Hell, he didn&rsquo;t even know if she was alive. He looked at her with a pained look. The way he hurt her, left her, and ruined her. He regretted it all. He knew he made a choice four years ago and he deeply regretted it. Seeing her now intensified those hurt feelings. He tried to call her name but with one look he shut his mouth. He had no right.</p><p>The voice of Thanos broke them out of their thoughts. &ldquo;You said that they meant nothing to you Y/N. Was that a lie?&rdquo; He asked with hurt lacing his voice. He didn&rsquo;t want to believe that his &lsquo;daughter&rsquo; would fight him, but he knew she would. He broke his promise and her trust.</p><p>&ldquo;Trust me, if it was just this group of people you were slaughtering I&rsquo;d still be in Nusquam enjoying the planet. But, it isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; The heroes flinched at her words. They, save a few of them who&rsquo;s never met her, had betrayed her by either leaving her to die, trying and failing to assassinate her, and leave her after broken promises. </p><p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t want to fight you Thanos, but I will. For all the living creatures in this damned universe, I will.&rdquo; The grip on her spear tightened slightly.</p><p>&ldquo;Then so be it.&rdquo; Thanos said before snapping his fingers once more to rid of the female standing before him. Everyone tensed at the sight, but relaxed and became more confused when nothing happened to her. </p><p>&ldquo;How&hellip; How is this possible?&rdquo; he said in anger, astonishment, and slight fear. </p><p>Y/N&rsquo;s heart broke when Thanos made his choice. With s heavy sigh she spoke. &ldquo;The Ego Gem.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I demand you hand it over now before I kill off everyone you love.&rdquo; Thanos threatened. It was then that Y/N knew to let go. Their previous relationship meant nothing to him, and now it forced her to feel nothing as well. After everything, turning off her emotions was like a switch. </p><p>&ldquo;Which is no one. Thanos, I will give you one last chance to right your wrongs.&rdquo; Y/N with a calm and steady voice. Even the heroes on the sidelines feared how calm she was. Not a drop of sweat, a tremor in her voice, a shake in her hand. Nothing. Even the way she held Thanos&rsquo; gaze was unnerving. </p><p>Thanos raised his left hand and up came tree roots that were sharpened and flew towards the heroes and Y/N herself. With a swipe of her hand, the flying weapons turned into bubbles. She let out a giggle at the sight. </p><p>Thanos then opened a portal behind Y/N and tried to attack her from the back, but she opened another and was behind Thanos with a blink of an eye. She kicked behind his knee and he stumbled forward. He was shocked and confused and angry. No one bested him. <i>No one.</i> </p><p>He quickly spun around, and landed and right hook and the girl stumbled back. He took the moment of unclarity and grabbed her spear from her hands and plunged it into her heart. </p><p>The screams of the heroes could be heard as they ran to attack the man. They were frozen midway when they saw the female several meters behind Thanos, who was confused as the girl faded away with a familiar red outline. He turned to see the same girl behind him. </p><p>&ldquo;How is that possible?!&rdquo; he yelled, clearly frustrated. </p><p>She smirked. &ldquo;Like I said, Ego Gem.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lying. That Gem was destroyed. Even if you have it, that stone does not possess a single power of any one of these stones.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. It doesn&rsquo;t possess one, it possesses all and more.&rdquo; She stated smirking. She was loving the looks Thanos and the heroes had on their faces. It truly was comical.</p><p>&ldquo;You hand over that stone now.&rdquo; Thanos demanded. She had to laugh at that. It was like in those movies where the cops chase the perpetrator and yelling 'stop&rsquo; as if they would. </p><p>&ldquo;Alright. I&rsquo;ll give you three guesses to try and figure out where it is. You get it right within your limit, I&rsquo;ll hand it to you.&rdquo; </p><p>The group, who had been sidelined, started protesting. This wasn&rsquo;t right. If Thanos did guess it right, they truly wouldn&rsquo;t be a match. They wanted to walk over to her and shake some sense in her if it weren&rsquo;t for their feet being held to the planet with the roots of the trees. Too bad it didn&rsquo;t cover their mouths, because they kept shouting about how bad of an idea it was. </p><p>Y/N didn&rsquo;t like it. To her, them telling her it was a stupid idea was like them telling her she was stupid. <i>Well, I&rsquo;m not.</i> She thought to herself. With one look, they were silenced, and not due to the power she possessed. They knew better.</p><p>&ldquo;I will not play your games you foolish girl.&rdquo; By now Thanos was walking towards her. If he couldn&rsquo;t take her out with the stones, then it&rsquo;ll be old fashioned way.</p><p>She looked at the man advancing on her. With one squeeze of her hands, her spear grew another foot on both sides. The blades at the end now had tiny blades sprouting from the end, curving towards the wielder. With the blades like that it would be like sticking a hot knife in butter, but pulling out, well that was a different story. Pulling out the knife would result pulling out chunks of the poor beast.</p><p>Y/N stood in her fighting stance and waited for Thanos. This was her even match. Someone as powerful as her, and as battle smart as she was. </p><p>&mdash; (because I can&rsquo;t write fighting scenes to save a life) &mdash;</p><p>They have fought for a while. Both had cuts and bruises caused by the other but they duo kept going. Those who were sidelined watched. They so badly wanted to help the girl, but they couldn&rsquo;t get free of the roots that held them captive.</p><p>Y/N was swept off her feet and landed on her back, knocking the air out of her lungs. She opened her eyes as she saw Thanos bringing sword down fast on her. She moved in time and Thanos&rsquo; sword was stuck in the root. His concentration broke for a split second, but that was all Y/N needed. She grabbed her spear laying near them and spun it once to get momentum before plunging it into his heart, much like he did with 'her&rsquo; at the beginning of their meeting. </p><p>He was brought down to his knees. She knew it wouldn&rsquo;t kill him, not while he still had the gauntlet. With another swipe of her hand the gauntlet was removed from his hand. She kicked it a few good feet from them before looking at Thanos. The adrenaline was gone, and the emotions were back. </p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she asked the man who she once saw as a father figure.</p><p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t understand little dove.&rdquo; He replied weakly. Now that his life was fading, he knew he didn&rsquo;t regret what he did. He only regrets that he had to hurt Y/N in the process. &ldquo;I may not have kept my promise about this but know&hellip; know that my words were true and pure.&rdquo; </p><p>The life in his eyes were gone. Thanos is dead. The heroes who were now free from their bondage were celebrating. They were hugging and congratulating each other as if they were the ones who defeated him. All but one. Loki stood there and watched as knelt down next to Thanos silently crying. No sound was made. No emotion was shown on her face. The only evidence was the tears that silently fell down her cheeks. </p><p>She felt a hand on her shoulder and instantly knew who it was. Loki. The slight shrug of her shoulder was enough of a sign for him that she didn&rsquo;t welcome his touch. His heart broke a little more as he walked away from the broken girl.</p><p><i>&ldquo;You deserve to be loved like you love, to be happy, and most of all you deserve to be held in the highest glory. You have been beaten and torn down, dragged through hell, and lost a child, but yet you still manage to smile. You truly are the strongest person I know in this universe little dove. Remember; Respect yourself and do not lower yourself for anyone, not even me. Respect yourself enough to walk away from anything and anyone who doesn&rsquo;t respect, love, and cherish you like you should be.&rdquo;</i></p><p>The memory of his words healed her broken heart a little. They always leave, and Thanos was no exception.</p><p>Y/N stood in front of the group. She held a passive face. She was neither angry or hurt by them. She had learned to let them go. In a way, she forgave them. All of them, even Loki. </p><p>The stones were destroyed all but two. Eyes followed her as she moved to Tony and Strange. </p><p>&ldquo;I believe that this will give your friend life once again.&rdquo; She handed the mind stone to Tony. &ldquo;And I believe that this belongs to you.&rdquo; Y/N said as she handed the time stone to Strange. The two men were extremely grateful. Even after all they did, she thought of them. </p><p>They opened their mouths to speak but was silenced by Y/N herself. </p><p>&ldquo;No need to apologize. What&rsquo;s done is done and there&rsquo;s no fixing that. We could go back in time and fix it, but I would still know. I&rsquo;ve moved on. From the betrayal, the attempt assassinations, and,&rdquo; she turned to face Loki. &ldquo;I forgave you too. It was hard, but I know that Freya wouldn&rsquo;t have wanted us to hate each other. I forgave you and I hope that you truly do move on and be with Eve. You both deserve happiness. And about our daughter, Freya. Loki, do not blame yourself. She may not physically be with us, but I know our little girl is watching over us. She will never be forgotten. I know we both love her too much to do so.&rdquo; Y/N said as she unconsciously rubs the tattoo of her late daughters name on her wrist. &ldquo;You truly deserve to be happy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But so, do you.&rdquo; Replied Loki.</p><p>&ldquo;And I did. I found a man that loves me. Truly loves me.&rdquo; Y/N replied with a small smile at the memory of her boyfriend. </p><p>They stood silently not knowing what to say until a voice spoke out.</p><p>&ldquo;You know, when you decided to defeat the almighty Thanos alone I was hurt because I thought we were in this together. Guess not.&rdquo; </p><p>They all had turned to the source of the voice confused. Y/N had a small smile on her face. She knew he would find his way to her. It seems that he always did. </p><p>She playfully rolled her eyes as she walked up to him and hugging him. &ldquo;Forgive me, love. I didn&rsquo;t know that you were up for an adventure.&rdquo; </p><p>Erik Killmonger playfully glared at his girlfriend. Yes, he was upset but he knew she could hold her own. He was filled with pride and love for the girls in his arms. He looked at the group. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, it seems that we are due for departure seeing as there is no reason for us to stay.&rdquo; Erik stated as he walked towards his space ship he landed quite a bit of ways away. </p><p>Y/N gave the group a slight nod before turning around.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait. The stone. The Ego Gem. Where is it?&rdquo; Tony asked out of curiosity.</p><p>Y/N turned and gave him a slight smile. &ldquo;There is no stone Stark, for I am the Ego Gem.&rdquo; </p><p>The couple left the stunned group behind and before they were out of sight, Y/N snapped her fingers. None thought much of it until they returned home.</p><p>Bucky, Falcon, T'challa and everyone else who 'died&rsquo; was back on earth. There wasn&rsquo;t a reunion that wasn&rsquo;t filled with tears.</p><p>Steve held onto Bucky like he was the last cup of water. He was afraid that if he let go, Bucky would disappear again. Suri cried, and she clung onto her older brother. Falcon soon joined the hug with the rest of the Avengers. Everyone was happy to see their loved ones. Tony was happy, but he didn&rsquo;t see the kid he&rsquo;d been wanting to see. And Rocket didn&rsquo;t see anyone from his family.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark.&rdquo; A voice said from behind Tony and turned to see Peter. He let out a strangled sob and ran to the boy. He hugged the son he had &ldquo;inadvertently&rdquo; adopted. Behind them was Rockets crew. Their reunion was just filled with just as much love and jokes. </p><p>Everyone was delighted and over the moon to see those they lost. Y/N watched from a distance as people reunited. Not only the heroes but the common folks as well. The light smile played on her lips as she leaned into Erik&rsquo;s embrace. </p><p>&ldquo;They deserve to be happy too.&rdquo; She said as Erik placed a kiss on her temple. </p><p>&ldquo;But you most of all.&rdquo; Erik said as he slipped a gold band with a single square cut diamond(2) on her ring finger. It was simple yet extravagant, just like her. As her answer she turned around and kissed her, professing her love through her actions.\u00a0</p><p>1.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"711\" data-orig-width=\"569\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e6c94d86b1f7aeaddf24cf8469d40930/tumblr_pd8g5xzWLL1vixlas_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"711\" data-orig-width=\"569\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"760\" data-orig-width=\"570\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5d67b378e4c620dbceee23bae62198a9/tumblr_pd8g5xwLk21vixlas_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"760\" data-orig-width=\"570\"/></figure>",

            "comment": "<p><h1>Never Meant to Be pt.2</h1><p>Warnings: character death, mentions of death of child</p><p>\u201cYou will not defeat me. You are mere mortals!\u201d Thanos yelled at the group of heroes standing before him. \u201cYou have tried before but it was in vain. You are no match for the stones that I possess. With another snap of my fingers you will disintegrate like your friends, and your world will be left defenseless. Is that what you want?\u201d </p><p>No one spoke a word, knowing that he was right. They were foolish to try and defeat the man who had ended the lives of trillions with a simple action. The group was lost. They didn\u2019t know whether to retreat or if they should stay and at least <i>try</i>.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2014\u201d</p><p>Thanos was interrupted when a figure emerged from the west tree lines with a spear(1) in her left hand. The female radiated power and energy, just as the gauntlet with the infinity stones. She stepped towards the purple villain with confidence, the exact opposite of what she felt. She felt hurt, betrayed, and angered. The three feelings that seem to last longer than any other in her life. </p><p>\u201cThanos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N, what are you doing here? You were meant to be in\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Nusquam, on the other side of the universe. Yeah, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you here Y/N?\u201d Thanos asked the girl whom he had come to have a soft spot for. He never meant to love the girl as he loved Gamora, but when he found her, <i>listened </i>to her, he knew that they were alike. Having lost everything, despite trying their damndest to hold on. To being betrayed by those they loved. The decade that Y/N was absent, she spent with Thanos. She knew of his plans and confronted him about it. He had promised that he wouldn\u2019t. So, he kept her in the dark about it all. After he sent her to Nusquam, he set out to find the stones. He had sacrificed one daughter, he wasn\u2019t going to sacrifice this one as well. </p><p>\u201cI came for them Thanos. I came to the knowledge of what you succeeded in doing to the planets. Thanos, you promised you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d Y/N pleaded with the man. She didn\u2019t want to fight him. She didn\u2019t want to lose another person in her life, but trillions of lives depended on this.</p><p>The group of heroes looked at the duo with confused looks. <i>Y/N knew Thanos?

You are mere mortals!\u201d Thanos yelled at the group of heroes standing before him. \u201cYou have tried before but it was in vain. You are no match for the stones that I possess. With another snap of my fingers you will disintegrate like your friends, and your world will be left defenseless. Is that what you want?\u201d </p><p>No one spoke a word, knowing that he was right. They were foolish to try and defeat the man who had ended the lives of trillions with a simple action. The group was lost. They didn\u2019t know whether to retreat or if they should stay and at least <i>try</i>.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2014\u201d</p><p>Thanos was interrupted when a figure emerged from the west tree lines with a spear(1) in her left hand. The female radiated power and energy, just as the gauntlet with the infinity stones. She stepped towards the purple villain with confidence, the exact opposite of what she felt. She felt hurt, betrayed, and angered. The three feelings that seem to last longer than any other in her life. </p><p>\u201cThanos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N, what are you doing here? You were meant to be in\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Nusquam, on the other side of the universe. Yeah, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you here Y/N?\u201d Thanos asked the girl whom he had come to have a soft spot for. He never meant to love the girl as he loved Gamora, but when he found her, <i>listened </i>to her, he knew that they were alike. Having lost everything, despite trying their damndest to hold on. To being betrayed by those they loved. The decade that Y/N was absent, she spent with Thanos. She knew of his plans and confronted him about it. He had promised that he wouldn\u2019t. So, he kept her in the dark about it all. After he sent her to Nusquam, he set out to find the stones. He had sacrificed one daughter, he wasn\u2019t going to sacrifice this one as well. </p><p>\u201cI came for them Thanos. I came to the knowledge of what you succeeded in doing to the planets. Thanos, you promised you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d Y/N pleaded with the man. She didn\u2019t want to fight him. She didn\u2019t want to lose another person in her life, but trillions of lives depended on this.</p><p>The group of heroes looked at the duo with confused looks. <i>Y/N knew Thanos? She meant something to him? </i>They were confused as to how and why, most of all Loki, Y/N\u2019s ex-husband. He didn\u2019t know that she had found comfort in the arms of their mortal enemy. Hell, he didn\u2019t even know if she was alive. He looked at her with a pained look. The way he hurt her, left her, and ruined her. He regretted it all. He knew he made a choice four years ago and he deeply regretted it. Seeing her now intensified those hurt feelings. He tried to call her name but with one look he shut his mouth. He had no right.</p><p>The voice of Thanos broke them out of their thoughts. \u201cYou said that they meant nothing to you Y/N. Was that a lie?\u201d He asked with hurt lacing his voice. He didn\u2019t want to believe that his \u2018daughter\u2019 would fight him, but he knew she would. He broke his promise and her trust.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, if it was just this group of people you were slaughtering I\u2019d still be in Nusquam enjoying the planet. But, it isn\u2019t.\u201d The heroes flinched at her words. They, save a few of them who\u2019s never met her, had betrayed her by either leaving her to die, trying and failing to assassinate her, and leave her after broken promises. </p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t want to fight you Thanos, but I will. For all the living creatures in this damned universe, I will.\u201d The grip on her spear tightened slightly.</p><p>\u201cThen so be it.\u201d Thanos said before snapping his fingers once more to rid of the female standing before him. Everyone tensed at the sight, but relaxed and became more confused when nothing happened to her. </p><p>\u201cHow\u2026 How is this possible?\u201d he said in anger, astonishment, and slight fear. </p><p>Y/N\u2019s heart broke when Thanos made his choice. With s heavy sigh she spoke. \u201cThe Ego Gem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI demand you hand it over now before I kill off everyone you love.\u201d Thanos threatened. It was then that Y/N knew to let go. Their previous relationship meant nothing to him, and now it forced her to feel nothing as well. After everything, turning off her emotions was like a switch. </p><p>\u201cWhich is no one. Thanos, I will give you one last chance to right your wrongs.\u201d Y/N with a calm and steady voice. Even the heroes on the sidelines feared how calm she was. Not a drop of sweat, a tremor in her voice, a shake in her hand. Nothing. Even the way she held Thanos\u2019 gaze was unnerving. </p><p>Thanos raised his left hand and up came tree roots that were sharpened and flew towards the heroes and Y/N herself. With a swipe of her hand, the flying weapons turned into bubbles. She let out a giggle at the sight. </p><p>Thanos then opened a portal behind Y/N and tried to attack her from the back, but she opened another and was behind Thanos with a blink of an eye. She kicked behind his knee and he stumbled forward. He was shocked and confused and angry. No one bested him. <i>No one.</i> </p><p>He quickly spun around, and landed and right hook and the girl stumbled back. He took the moment of unclarity and grabbed her spear from her hands and plunged it into her heart. </p><p>The screams of the heroes could be heard as they ran to attack the man. They were frozen midway when they saw the female several meters behind Thanos, who was confused as the girl faded away with a familiar red outline. He turned to see the same girl behind him. </p><p>\u201cHow is that possible?!\u201d he yelled, clearly frustrated. </p><p>She smirked. \u201cLike I said, Ego Gem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying. That Gem was destroyed. Even if you have it, that stone does not possess a single power of any one of these stones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. It doesn\u2019t possess one, it possesses all and more.\u201d She stated smirking. She was loving the looks Thanos and the heroes had on their faces. It truly was comical.</p><p>\u201cYou hand over that stone now.\u201d Thanos demanded. She had to laugh at that. It was like in those movies where the cops chase the perpetrator and yelling 'stop\u2019 as if they would. </p><p>\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll give you three guesses to try and figure out where it is. You get it right within your limit, I\u2019ll hand it to you.\u201d </p><p>The group, who had been sidelined, started protesting. This wasn\u2019t right. If Thanos did guess it right, they truly wouldn\u2019t be a match. They wanted to walk over to her and shake some sense in her if it weren\u2019t for their feet being held to the planet with the roots of the trees. Too bad it didn\u2019t cover their mouths, because they kept shouting about how bad of an idea it was. </p><p>Y/N didn\u2019t like it. To her, them telling her it was a stupid idea was like them telling her she was stupid. <i>Well, I\u2019m not.</i> She thought to herself. With one look, they were silenced, and not due to the power she possessed. They knew better.</p><p>\u201cI will not play your games you foolish girl.\u201d By now Thanos was walking towards her. If he couldn\u2019t take her out with the stones, then it\u2019ll be old fashioned way.</p><p>She looked at the man advancing on her. With one squeeze of her hands, her spear grew another foot on both sides. The blades at the end now had tiny blades sprouting from the end, curving towards the wielder. With the blades like that it would be like sticking a hot knife in butter, but pulling out, well that was a different story. Pulling out the knife would result pulling out chunks of the poor beast.</p><p>Y/N stood in her fighting stance and waited for Thanos. This was her even match. Someone as powerful as her, and as battle smart as she was. </p><p>\u2014 (because I can\u2019t write fighting scenes to save a life) \u2014</p><p>They have fought for a while. Both had cuts and bruises caused by the other but they duo kept going. Those who were sidelined watched. They so badly wanted to help the girl, but they couldn\u2019t get free of the roots that held them captive.</p><p>Y/N was swept off her feet and landed on her back, knocking the air out of her lungs. She opened her eyes as she saw Thanos bringing sword down fast on her. She moved in time and Thanos\u2019 sword was stuck in the root. His concentration broke for a split second, but that was all Y/N needed. She grabbed her spear laying near them and spun it once to get momentum before plunging it into his heart, much like he did with 'her\u2019 at the beginning of their meeting. </p><p>He was brought down to his knees. She knew it wouldn\u2019t kill him, not while he still had the gauntlet. With another swipe of her hand the gauntlet was removed from his hand. She kicked it a few good feet from them before looking at Thanos. The adrenaline was gone, and the emotions were back. </p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked the man who she once saw as a father figure.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t understand little dove.\u201d He replied weakly. Now that his life was fading, he knew he didn\u2019t regret what he did. He only regrets that he had to hurt Y/N in the process. \u201cI may not have kept my promise about this but know\u2026 know that my words were true and pure.\u201d </p><p>The life in his eyes were gone. Thanos is dead. The heroes who were now free from their bondage were celebrating. They were hugging and congratulating each other as if they were the ones who defeated him. All but one. Loki stood there and watched as knelt down next to Thanos silently crying. No sound was made. No emotion was shown on her face. The only evidence was the tears that silently fell down her cheeks. </p><p>She felt a hand on her shoulder and instantly knew who it was. Loki. The slight shrug of her shoulder was enough of a sign for him that she didn\u2019t welcome his touch. His heart broke a little more as he walked away from the broken girl.</p><p><i>\u201cYou deserve to be loved like you love, to be happy, and most of all you deserve to be held in the highest glory. You have been beaten and torn down, dragged through hell, and lost a child, but yet you still manage to smile. You truly are the strongest person I know in this universe little dove. Remember; Respect yourself and do not lower yourself for anyone, not even me. Respect yourself enough to walk away from anything and anyone who doesn\u2019t respect, love, and cherish you like you should be.\u201d</i></p><p>The memory of his words healed her broken heart a little. They always leave, and Thanos was no exception.</p><p>Y/N stood in front of the group. She held a passive face. She was neither angry or hurt by them. She had learned to let them go. In a way, she forgave them. All of them, even Loki. </p><p>The stones were destroyed all but two. Eyes followed her as she moved to Tony and Strange. </p><p>\u201cI believe that this will give your friend life once again.\u201d She handed the mind stone to Tony. \u201cAnd I believe that this belongs to you.\u201d Y/N said as she handed the time stone to Strange. The two men were extremely grateful. Even after all they did, she thought of them. </p><p>They opened their mouths to speak but was silenced by Y/N herself. </p><p>\u201cNo need to apologize. What\u2019s done is done and there\u2019s no fixing that. We could go back in time and fix it, but I would still know. I\u2019ve moved on. From the betrayal, the attempt assassinations, and,\u201d she turned to face Loki. \u201cI forgave you too. It was hard, but I know that Freya wouldn\u2019t have wanted us to hate each other. I forgave you and I hope that you truly do move on and be with Eve. You both deserve happiness. And about our daughter, Freya. Loki, do not blame yourself. She may not physically be with us, but I know our little girl is watching over us. She will never be forgotten. I know we both love her too much to do so.\u201d Y/N said as she unconsciously rubs the tattoo of her late daughters name on her wrist. \u201cYou truly deserve to be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut so, do you.\u201d Replied Loki.</p><p>\u201cAnd I did. I found a man that loves me. Truly loves me.\u201d Y/N replied with a small smile at the memory of her boyfriend. </p><p>They stood silently not knowing what to say until a voice spoke out.</p><p>\u201cYou know, when you decided to defeat the almighty Thanos alone I was hurt because I thought we were in this together. Guess not.\u201d </p><p>They all had turned to the source of the voice confused. Y/N had a small smile on her face. She knew he would find his way to her. It seems that he always did. </p><p>She playfully rolled her eyes as she walked up to him and hugging him. \u201cForgive me, love. I didn\u2019t know that you were up for an adventure.\u201d </p><p>Erik Killmonger playfully glared at his girlfriend. Yes, he was upset but he knew she could hold her own. He was filled with pride and love for the girls in his arms. He looked at the group. </p><p>\u201cWell, it seems that we are due for departure seeing as there is no reason for us to stay.\u201d Erik stated as he walked towards his space ship he landed quite a bit of ways away. </p><p>Y/N gave the group a slight nod before turning around.</p><p>\u201cWait. The stone. The Ego Gem. Where is it?\u201d Tony asked out of curiosity.</p><p>Y/N turned and gave him a slight smile. \u201cThere is no stone Stark, for I am the Ego Gem.\u201d </p><p>The couple left the stunned group behind and before they were out of sight, Y/N snapped her fingers. None thought much of it until they returned home.</p><p>Bucky, Falcon, T'challa and everyone else who 'died\u2019 was back on earth. There wasn\u2019t a reunion that wasn\u2019t filled with tears.</p><p>Steve held onto Bucky like he was the last cup of water. He was afraid that if he let go, Bucky would disappear again. Suri cried, and she clung onto her older brother. Falcon soon joined the hug with the rest of the Avengers. Everyone was happy to see their loved ones. Tony was happy, but he didn\u2019t see the kid he\u2019d been wanting to see. And Rocket didn\u2019t see anyone from his family.</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark.\u201d A voice said from behind Tony and turned to see Peter. He let out a strangled sob and ran to the boy. He hugged the son he had \u201cinadvertently\u201d adopted. Behind them was Rockets crew. Their reunion was just filled with just as much love and jokes. </p><p>Everyone was delighted and over the moon to see those they lost. Y/N watched from a distance as people reunited. Not only the heroes but the common folks as well. The light smile played on her lips as she leaned into Erik\u2019s embrace. </p><p>\u201cThey deserve to be happy too.\u201d She said as Erik placed a kiss on her temple. </p><p>\u201cBut you most of all.\u201d Erik said as he slipped a gold band with a single square cut diamond(2) on her ring finger. It was simple yet extravagant, just like her. As her answer she turned around and kissed her, professing her love through her actions.\u00a0</p><p>1.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"711\" data-orig-width=\"569\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e6c94d86b1f7aeaddf24cf8469d40930/tumblr_pd8g5xzWLL1vixlas_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"711\" data-orig-width=\"569\"></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"760\" data-orig-width=\"570\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5d67b378e4c620dbceee23bae62198a9/tumblr_pd8g5xwLk21vixlas_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"760\" data-orig-width=\"570\"></figure></p>",

He took the moment of unclarity and grabbed her spear from her hands and plunged it into her heart. </p><p>The screams of the heroes could be heard as they ran to attack the man. They were frozen midway when they saw the female several meters behind Thanos, who was confused as the girl faded away with a familiar red outline. He turned to see the same girl behind him. </p><p>&ldquo;How is that possible?!&rdquo; he yelled, clearly frustrated. </p><p>She smirked. &ldquo;Like I said, Ego Gem.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lying. That Gem was destroyed. Even if you have it, that stone does not possess a single power of any one of these stones.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. It doesn&rsquo;t possess one, it possesses all and more.&rdquo; She stated smirking. She was loving the looks Thanos and the heroes had on their faces. It truly was comical.</p><p>&ldquo;You hand over that stone now.&rdquo; Thanos demanded. She had to laugh at that. It was like in those movies where the cops chase the perpetrator and yelling 'stop&rsquo; as if they would. </p><p>&ldquo;Alright. I&rsquo;ll give you three guesses to try and figure out where it is. You get it right within your limit, I&rsquo;ll hand it to you.&rdquo; </p><p>The group, who had been sidelined, started protesting. This wasn&rsquo;t right. If Thanos did guess it right, they truly wouldn&rsquo;t be a match. They wanted to walk over to her and shake some sense in her if it weren&rsquo;t for their feet being held to the planet with the roots of the trees. Too bad it didn&rsquo;t cover their mouths, because they kept shouting about how bad of an idea it was. </p><p>Y/N didn&rsquo;t like it. To her, them telling her it was a stupid idea was like them telling her she was stupid. <i>Well, I&rsquo;m not.</i> She thought to herself. With one look, they were silenced, and not due to the power she possessed. They knew better.</p><p>&ldquo;I will not play your games you foolish girl.&rdquo; By now Thanos was walking towards her. If he couldn&rsquo;t take her out with the stones, then it&rsquo;ll be old fashioned way.</p><p>She looked at the man advancing on her. With one squeeze of her hands, her spear grew another foot on both sides. The blades at the end now had tiny blades sprouting from the end, curving towards the wielder. With the blades like that it would be like sticking a hot knife in butter, but pulling out, well that was a different story. Pulling out the knife would result pulling out chunks of the poor beast.</p><p>Y/N stood in her fighting stance and waited for Thanos. This was her even match. Someone as powerful as her, and as battle smart as she was. </p><p>&mdash; (because I can&rsquo;t write fighting scenes to save a life) &mdash;</p><p>They have fought for a while. Both had cuts and bruises caused by the other but they duo kept going. Those who were sidelined watched. They so badly wanted to help the girl, but they couldn&rsquo;t get free of the roots that held them captive.</p><p>Y/N was swept off her feet and landed on her back, knocking the air out of her lungs. She opened her eyes as she saw Thanos bringing sword down fast on her. She moved in time and Thanos&rsquo; sword was stuck in the root. His concentration broke for a split second, but that was all Y/N needed. She grabbed her spear laying near them and spun it once to get momentum before plunging it into his heart, much like he did with 'her&rsquo; at the beginning of their meeting. </p><p>He was brought down to his knees. She knew it wouldn&rsquo;t kill him, not while he still had the gauntlet. With another swipe of her hand the gauntlet was removed from his hand. She kicked it a few good feet from them before looking at Thanos. The adrenaline was gone, and the emotions were back. </p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she asked the man who she once saw as a father figure.</p><p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t understand little dove.&rdquo; He replied weakly. Now that his life was fading, he knew he didn&rsquo;t regret what he did. He only regrets that he had to hurt Y/N in the process. &ldquo;I may not have kept my promise about this but know&hellip; know that my words were true and pure.&rdquo; </p><p>The life in his eyes were gone. Thanos is dead. The heroes who were now free from their bondage were celebrating. They were hugging and congratulating each other as if they were the ones who defeated him. All but one. Loki stood there and watched as knelt down next to Thanos silently crying. No sound was made. No emotion was shown on her face. The only evidence was the tears that silently fell down her cheeks. </p><p>She felt a hand on her shoulder and instantly knew who it was. Loki. The slight shrug of her shoulder was enough of a sign for him that she didn&rsquo;t welcome his touch. His heart broke a little more as he walked away from the broken girl.</p><p><i>&ldquo;You deserve to be loved like you love, to be happy, and most of all you deserve to be held in the highest glory. You have been beaten and torn down, dragged through hell, and lost a child, but yet you still manage to smile. You truly are the strongest person I know in this universe little dove. Remember; Respect yourself and do not lower yourself for anyone, not even me. Respect yourself enough to walk away from anything and anyone who doesn&rsquo;t respect, love, and cherish you like you should be.&rdquo;</i></p><p>The memory of his words healed her broken heart a little. They always leave, and Thanos was no exception.</p><p>Y/N stood in front of the group. She held a passive face. She was neither angry or hurt by them. She had learned to let them go. In a way, she forgave them. All of them, even Loki. </p><p>The stones were destroyed all but two. Eyes followed her as she moved to Tony and Strange. </p><p>&ldquo;I believe that this will give your friend life once again.&rdquo; She handed the mind stone to Tony. &ldquo;And I believe that this belongs to you.&rdquo; Y/N said as she handed the time stone to Strange. The two men were extremely grateful. Even after all they did, she thought of them. </p><p>They opened their mouths to speak but was silenced by Y/N herself. </p><p>&ldquo;No need to apologize. What&rsquo;s done is done and there&rsquo;s no fixing that. We could go back in time and fix it, but I would still know. I&rsquo;ve moved on. From the betrayal, the attempt assassinations, and,&rdquo; she turned to face Loki. &ldquo;I forgave you too. It was hard, but I know that Freya wouldn&rsquo;t have wanted us to hate each other. I forgave you and I hope that you truly do move on and be with Eve. You both deserve happiness. And about our daughter, Freya. Loki, do not blame yourself. She may not physically be with us, but I know our little girl is watching over us. She will never be forgotten. I know we both love her too much to do so.&rdquo; Y/N said as she unconsciously rubs the tattoo of her late daughters name on her wrist. &ldquo;You truly deserve to be happy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But so, do you.&rdquo; Replied Loki.</p><p>&ldquo;And I did. I found a man that loves me. Truly loves me.&rdquo; Y/N replied with a small smile at the memory of her boyfriend. </p><p>They stood silently not knowing what to say until a voice spoke out.</p><p>&ldquo;You know, when you decided to defeat the almighty Thanos alone I was hurt because I thought we were in this together. Guess not.&rdquo; </p><p>They all had turned to the source of the voice confused. Y/N had a small smile on her face. She knew he would find his way to her. It seems that he always did. </p><p>She playfully rolled her eyes as she walked up to him and hugging him. &ldquo;Forgive me, love. I didn&rsquo;t know that you were up for an adventure.&rdquo; </p><p>Erik Killmonger playfully glared at his girlfriend. Yes, he was upset but he knew she could hold her own. He was filled with pride and love for the girls in his arms. He looked at the group. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, it seems that we are due for departure seeing as there is no reason for us to stay.&rdquo; Erik stated as he walked towards his space ship he landed quite a bit of ways away. </p><p>Y/N gave the group a slight nod before turning around.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait. The stone. The Ego Gem. Where is it?&rdquo; Tony asked out of curiosity.</p><p>Y/N turned and gave him a slight smile. &ldquo;There is no stone Stark, for I am the Ego Gem.&rdquo; </p><p>The couple left the stunned group behind and before they were out of sight, Y/N snapped her fingers. None thought much of it until they returned home.</p><p>Bucky, Falcon, T'challa and everyone else who 'died&rsquo; was back on earth. There wasn&rsquo;t a reunion that wasn&rsquo;t filled with tears.</p><p>Steve held onto Bucky like he was the last cup of water. He was afraid that if he let go, Bucky would disappear again. Suri cried, and she clung onto her older brother. Falcon soon joined the hug with the rest of the Avengers. Everyone was happy to see their loved ones. Tony was happy, but he didn&rsquo;t see the kid he&rsquo;d been wanting to see. And Rocket didn&rsquo;t see anyone from his family.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark.&rdquo; A voice said from behind Tony and turned to see Peter. He let out a strangled sob and ran to the boy. He hugged the son he had &ldquo;inadvertently&rdquo; adopted. Behind them was Rockets crew. Their reunion was just filled with just as much love and jokes. </p><p>Everyone was delighted and over the moon to see those they lost. Y/N watched from a distance as people reunited. Not only the heroes but the common folks as well. The light smile played on her lips as she leaned into Erik&rsquo;s embrace. </p><p>&ldquo;They deserve to be happy too.&rdquo; She said as Erik placed a kiss on her temple. </p><p>&ldquo;But you most of all.&rdquo; Erik said as he slipped a gold band with a single square cut diamond(2) on her ring finger. It was simple yet extravagant, just like her. As her answer she turned around and kissed her, professing her love through her actions.&nbsp;</p><p>1.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e6c94d86b1f7aeaddf24cf8469d40930/tumblr_pd8g5xzWLL1vixlas_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5d67b378e4c620dbceee23bae62198a9/tumblr_pd8g5xwLk21vixlas_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure></p>",
