        "body": "<p>Disclaimer: this is my first fic. I just want to apologize in advance. It\u2019s not very good.</p><p>Tj woke up at 6:20 am to the incessant sound of beeping from his phone. He was up till 3:30 that night finishing a project and wanted nothing more than to go to bed, so he did exactly that. Groggily, he rolled over and shut off his alarm, falling back asleep (for<i> </i>what he swore would only be 5 minutes) before he could stop himself. The problem is, by the time he woke up again it was 6:50 and he had to be out of the house in 10 minutes.</p><p>\u201cShit! I can\u2019t believe I slept in this late!\u201d Dragging himself out of bed, he quickly picked out the first clothes he found and ran downstairs to eat breakfast, leaving no time to do his usual hair routine before heading out.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lookin a little stressed there Tj\u201d mocked Amber as she waited at the front door for her brother. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotta go or we\u2019re gonna be late\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah yeah I overslept a bit, let me just go grab my bookbag.\u201d</p><p>Tj was so tired that it took till he was almost at school to realize that he had forgotten to put in his contact lenses, which meant that he\u2019d have to wear his glasses all day and he hated that. For the most part Tj could see fine, but when it came to reading he really needed them and he knew he had a test today. Grabbing the glasses from his bag and putting them on, he thought about how much he just wanted to see Cyrus now, knowing he was probably the one person who could always cheer him up.</p><p>A few minutes later Tj found him at his locker talking to Buffy and Andi before class started and decided to head over. <i>Wow he looks so cute today.. Does he always look this good? Of course he does it\u2019s Cyrus! And ugh I look like this today.. Whatever, just play it cool</i>. Taking his own advice he walked up to the boy, casually slinging an arm around his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWell Kippen, this is certainly a new look for you\u201d Buffy joked, looking at his unusually fluffy hair and glasses that were most definitely NOT the regular style of Tj Kippen. \u201cI agree\u201d added Andi, \u201cit\u2019s not bad, I think it actually makes you look nicer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh thanks. It wasn\u2019t exactly planned..\u201d According to his own opinions, ironically, the glasses made him look stupid. \u201cWell what about you Cyrus? What do you think?\u201d Tj figured he\u2019d ask since they were already discussing it. He also noticed Cyrus hadn\u2019t said anything yet which was sort of starting to make Tj worry that he didn\u2019t like the \u201cI ran out of the house ten minutes late\u201d look.</p><p>Instead, Cyrus stood there with a huge dorky grin on his face, admiring Tj and this relaxed style that he seemed to have today. \u201cOh I uh- it\u2019s really- you look- I mean- wow\u2026\u201d Normally it would feel awkward but the lack of a sentence seemed to be enough to make the older boy flattered, the red tint spreading along his cheeks at the same time as Cyrus\u2019s. \u201cI just mean that you look good, -uh it, your hair, it looks good like that. Yup, that\u2019s it I\u2019ll stop now,\u201d Cyrus laughed uneasily. He suddenly made eye contact with Tj and neither of them really stopped it.</p><p>At that point Buffy that felt her and Andi should probably go, so she broke the silence that was starting to set in. \u201cCome on we\u2019d better get to class before we\u2019re late.\u201d She grabbed Andi\u2019s arm and started moving her away but the girl protested, not understanding what Buffy was trying to do. \u201cWait what we still have 5 minutes?\u201d Then, not so subtly giving Andi the<i> come on lets leave them alone look</i>, Buffy said \u201coh yeah what I mean is I have to go get something from my locker and I need Andi to come with me.\u201d She was usually better at making up excuses but it didn\u2019t matter, Andi got what she was doing and followed along with it. \u201cRight! I forgot something in there yesterday and I uh.. need it for class! See you guys in a few!\u201d</p><p>After Andi and Buffy walked away Tj realized he still had his arm on Cyrus\u2019s shoulder and decided to keep it there anyways because hey, Cyrus didn\u2019t say anything yet, and Tj definitely didn\u2019t mind. He\u2019s had a crush on Cyrus for a few months now, he\u2019s just never had the courage to say anything. But something today, out of nowhere, something <i>changed</i> while seeing Cyrus and he couldn\u2019t explain it. Even with himself looking like a mess, he knew in that moment that today was when he had to tell him his feelings whether or not Cyrus would feel the same way.</p><p>\u201cSooo underdog, can you meet me after school at the swings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course! Is there any reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo not really I just want to tell you something but I don\u2019t think we have the time right now,\u201d he mentioned to the younger boy conveniently as the bell went off. \u201cSee you later?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus smirked, \u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201d As Tj hugged the boy, he hoped that he wasn\u2019t able to feel how quickly his heart was beating. <i>Buh bum, buh bum, buh bum, buh bum</i>. It was probably petty good though that Cyrus just hoped the exact same thing to himself.</p><p>Throughout the whole rest of the day all Tj did was worry, <i>what if he doesn\u2019t like me? I don\u2019t even know if he\u2019s gay.. he kissed that girl Iris, right? Oh no. He\u2019s straight. Ok stop I just have to tell him and get it off my chest or else I literally might die of this crush if I don\u2019t. </i>As soon as the bell rang for his last class Tj tried to push these thoughts to the back of his mind and pack up his stuff in a hurry to get to the swings.</p><p>He was pretty fast and got their first, so he decided to pick a swing and wait for Cyrus. <i>It\u2019s gonna be fine, </i>he convinced himself<i>. Even if I do look like a total mess today.. I wish I had my hair gel or at least my freaking contacts. Stupid homework. </i>At that last thought he looked up and saw Cyrus making his way over and take the swing right beside his own.</p><p>\u201cHey teej! How was your day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was pretty good actually, I think I passed my math test and I knew most of the answers! Your tutoring has been helping a lot.\u201d He smiled to himself at that. Having Cyrus teach him was probably the only thing that got him through math anymore, which is what he considered the most unbearable subject ever.</p><p>\u201cGood! I\u2019m really proud of you, you\u2019ve been working hard to maintain that grade.\u201d Although he was calm on the outside, Tj was screaming on the inside about how much he liked this boy. \u201cOh! So what did you want to talk about?\u201d Cyrus asked briskly.</p><p><i>Alright, here it goes. </i>\u201cRight. Well you see I guess, no I- I know, I like you Cyrus. I have for a while but I really didn\u2019t want to mess up what we have already. If you don\u2019t feel the same way I get it, I\u2019m kind of used to disappointment anyways. I mean hell, I don\u2019t even know if you\u2019re gay. I just <i>had</i> to get this off my chest.\u201d <i>Uhhhh </i>was all that came out of Cyrus\u2019s mouth as he stared at Tj who just confessed his feelings for him. A few more seconds of silence went by and Tj, feeling his heart drop to the bottom of his stomach, started to speak again \u201cright. Classic Tj. Anything good in my life I gotta mess it up. I\u2019m sorry Cyrus, I didn\u2019t want to make you feel uncomfortable around me. I\u2019ll go and we can forget this happened.\u201d As he got up from the swing Cyrus quickly grabbed his arm and pulled him back, a little closer then he planned.</p><p>\u201cNo wait Tj- It\u2019s just that I\u2019m in shock that you actually feel that way about me. I mean of course I like you too, I kinda thought it was pretty obvious, I\u2019m not very good at hiding my feelings\u201d Cyrus admitted, hoping Tj wasn\u2019t still upset.</p><p>\u201cYou seriously don\u2019t understand how relieved I am to hear that. I like you so much and honestly, I thought I\u2019d lose you if I admitted how I feel, especially knowing I haven\u2019t been the best person to be around in the past.\u201d Tj sighed, much more relaxed than before. They were just a few inches apart at this point, but Cyrus only grabbed Tjs hand to hold. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI meeaann.. you\u2019re not wrong, you might have had some rough moments in the past but that\u2019s just it. The past. You changed so much and that\u2019s what I admire about you most, the way you made yourself better and proved to me multiple times that you\u2019re a good person\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for believing in me Cyrus. I was kinda starting to lose hope in myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey it\u2019s just another service I provide.\u201d He replied with a small laugh. Tj started to lean in now, leaving barely any space between them.</p><p>\u201cIs it alright if I kiss you underdog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely\u201d Cyrus smirked, unable to stop his smile. The kiss made Tjs heart beat even faster than it already was and although it wasn\u2019t very long it was the best feeling in the world.</p><p>Looking up a few seconds later with totally pink cheeks, Cyrus stated \u201cby the way, I almost died when I saw you with the glasses and messy hair. I mean what I really wanted to say earlier is you look adorable but of course I thought you were Mr straight not-so-scary basketball guy, turns out you\u2019re just a real softie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, I can\u2019t believe you thought I was straight. I\u2019ve been dropping hints basically forever. Secondly\u2026 huh, maybe I should change my style. Tj the not-so-scary basketball guy who rocks messy hair and glasses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no\u201d Cyrus joked. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be able to take it. You\u2019d look too cute for me to handle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s just fair Cy. I\u2019ve had to deal with that every day for the past half year\u201d Cyrus blushed even more but Tj still couldn\u2019t believe this was happening. It probably had to be the best day of his life in this exact moment. He pulled Cyrus in for a close hug and softly kissed the top of his head, closing his eyes for a second, just taking in everything that happened. <i>Cyrus likes me. I kissed Cyrus. Holy shit I kissed Cyrus!!</i></p><p>It only took them a week to come out officially as boyfriends, and Tj was more than happy to give in to Cyrus\u2019s constant demand for forehead kisses. It really was so easy being around him and maybe unlike hair or glasses, dating Cyrus definitely wouldn\u2019t be one of his problems.</p>",

The problem is, by the time he woke up again it was 6:50 and he had to be out of the house in 10 minutes.</p><p>\u201cShit!

For the most part Tj could see fine, but when it came to reading he really needed them and he knew he had a test today. Grabbing the glasses from his bag and putting them on, he thought about how much he just wanted to see Cyrus now, knowing he was probably the one person who could always cheer him up.</p><p>A few minutes later Tj found him at his locker talking to Buffy and Andi before class started and decided to head over. <i>Wow he looks so cute today.. Does he always look this good? Of course he does it\u2019s Cyrus! And ugh I look like this today.. Whatever, just play it cool</i>. Taking his own advice he walked up to the boy, casually slinging an arm around his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWell Kippen, this is certainly a new look for you\u201d Buffy joked, looking at his unusually fluffy hair and glasses that were most definitely NOT the regular style of Tj Kippen. \u201cI agree\u201d added Andi, \u201cit\u2019s not bad, I think it actually makes you look nicer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh thanks. It wasn\u2019t exactly planned..\u201d According to his own opinions, ironically, the glasses made him look stupid. \u201cWell what about you Cyrus? What do you think?\u201d Tj figured he\u2019d ask since they were already discussing it. He also noticed Cyrus hadn\u2019t said anything yet which was sort of starting to make Tj worry that he didn\u2019t like the \u201cI ran out of the house ten minutes late\u201d look.</p><p>Instead, Cyrus stood there with a huge dorky grin on his face, admiring Tj and this relaxed style that he seemed to have today. \u201cOh I uh- it\u2019s really- you look- I mean- wow\u2026\u201d Normally it would feel awkward but the lack of a sentence seemed to be enough to make the older boy flattered, the red tint spreading along his cheeks at the same time as Cyrus\u2019s. \u201cI just mean that you look good, -uh it, your hair, it looks good like that. Yup, that\u2019s it I\u2019ll stop now,\u201d Cyrus laughed uneasily. He suddenly made eye contact with Tj and neither of them really stopped it.</p><p>At that point Buffy that felt her and Andi should probably go, so she broke the silence that was starting to set in. \u201cCome on we\u2019d better get to class before we\u2019re late.\u201d She grabbed Andi\u2019s arm and started moving her away but the girl protested, not understanding what Buffy was trying to do. \u201cWait what we still have 5 minutes?\u201d Then, not so subtly giving Andi the<i> come on lets leave them alone look</i>, Buffy said \u201coh yeah what I mean is I have to go get something from my locker and I need Andi to come with me.\u201d She was usually better at making up excuses but it didn\u2019t matter, Andi got what she was doing and followed along with it. \u201cRight! I forgot something in there yesterday and I uh.. need it for class! See you guys in a few!\u201d</p><p>After Andi and Buffy walked away Tj realized he still had his arm on Cyrus\u2019s shoulder and decided to keep it there anyways because hey, Cyrus didn\u2019t say anything yet, and Tj definitely didn\u2019t mind. He\u2019s had a crush on Cyrus for a few months now, he\u2019s just never had the courage to say anything. But something today, out of nowhere, something <i>changed</i> while seeing Cyrus and he couldn\u2019t explain it. Even with himself looking like a mess, he knew in that moment that today was when he had to tell him his feelings whether or not Cyrus would feel the same way.</p><p>\u201cSooo underdog, can you meet me after school at the swings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course! Is there any reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo not really I just want to tell you something but I don\u2019t think we have the time right now,\u201d he mentioned to the younger boy conveniently as the bell went off. \u201cSee you later?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus smirked, \u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201d As Tj hugged the boy, he hoped that he wasn\u2019t able to feel how quickly his heart was beating. <i>Buh bum, buh bum, buh bum, buh bum</i>. It was probably petty good though that Cyrus just hoped the exact same thing to himself.</p><p>Throughout the whole rest of the day all Tj did was worry, <i>what if he doesn\u2019t like me? I don\u2019t even know if he\u2019s gay.. he kissed that girl Iris, right? Oh no. He\u2019s straight. Ok stop I just have to tell him and get it off my chest or else I literally might die of this crush if I don\u2019t. </i>As soon as the bell rang for his last class Tj tried to push these thoughts to the back of his mind and pack up his stuff in a hurry to get to the swings.</p><p>He was pretty fast and got their first, so he decided to pick a swing and wait for Cyrus. <i>It\u2019s gonna be fine, </i>he convinced himself<i>. Even if I do look like a total mess today.. I wish I had my hair gel or at least my freaking contacts. Stupid homework. </i>At that last thought he looked up and saw Cyrus making his way over and take the swing right beside his own.</p><p>\u201cHey teej! How was your day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was pretty good actually, I think I passed my math test and I knew most of the answers! Your tutoring has been helping a lot.\u201d He smiled to himself at that. Having Cyrus teach him was probably the only thing that got him through math anymore, which is what he considered the most unbearable subject ever.</p><p>\u201cGood! I\u2019m really proud of you, you\u2019ve been working hard to maintain that grade.\u201d Although he was calm on the outside, Tj was screaming on the inside about how much he liked this boy. \u201cOh! So what did you want to talk about?\u201d Cyrus asked briskly.</p><p><i>Alright, here it goes. </i>\u201cRight. Well you see I guess, no I- I know, I like you Cyrus. I have for a while but I really didn\u2019t want to mess up what we have already. If you don\u2019t feel the same way I get it, I\u2019m kind of used to disappointment anyways. I mean hell, I don\u2019t even know if you\u2019re gay. I just <i>had</i> to get this off my chest.\u201d <i>Uhhhh </i>was all that came out of Cyrus\u2019s mouth as he stared at Tj who just confessed his feelings for him. A few more seconds of silence went by and Tj, feeling his heart drop to the bottom of his stomach, started to speak again \u201cright. Classic Tj. Anything good in my life I gotta mess it up. I\u2019m sorry Cyrus, I didn\u2019t want to make you feel uncomfortable around me. I\u2019ll go and we can forget this happened.\u201d As he got up from the swing Cyrus quickly grabbed his arm and pulled him back, a little closer then he planned.</p><p>\u201cNo wait Tj- It\u2019s just that I\u2019m in shock that you actually feel that way about me. I mean of course I like you too, I kinda thought it was pretty obvious, I\u2019m not very good at hiding my feelings\u201d Cyrus admitted, hoping Tj wasn\u2019t still upset.</p><p>\u201cYou seriously don\u2019t understand how relieved I am to hear that. I like you so much and honestly, I thought I\u2019d lose you if I admitted how I feel, especially knowing I haven\u2019t been the best person to be around in the past.\u201d Tj sighed, much more relaxed than before. They were just a few inches apart at this point, but Cyrus only grabbed Tjs hand to hold. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI meeaann.. you\u2019re not wrong, you might have had some rough moments in the past but that\u2019s just it. The past. You changed so much and that\u2019s what I admire about you most, the way you made yourself better and proved to me multiple times that you\u2019re a good person\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for believing in me Cyrus. I was kinda starting to lose hope in myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey it\u2019s just another service I provide.\u201d He replied with a small laugh. Tj started to lean in now, leaving barely any space between them.</p><p>\u201cIs it alright if I kiss you underdog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely\u201d Cyrus smirked, unable to stop his smile. The kiss made Tjs heart beat even faster than it already was and although it wasn\u2019t very long it was the best feeling in the world.</p><p>Looking up a few seconds later with totally pink cheeks, Cyrus stated \u201cby the way, I almost died when I saw you with the glasses and messy hair.

Grabbing the glasses from his bag and putting them on, he thought about how much he just wanted to see Cyrus now, knowing he was probably the one person who could always cheer him up.</p><p>A few minutes later Tj found him at his locker talking to Buffy and Andi before class started and decided to head over. <i>Wow he looks so cute today.. Does he always look this good? Of course he does it&rsquo;s Cyrus! And ugh I look like this today.. Whatever, just play it cool</i>. Taking his own advice he walked up to the boy, casually slinging an arm around his shoulders.</p><p>&ldquo;Well Kippen, this is certainly a new look for you&rdquo; Buffy joked, looking at his unusually fluffy hair and glasses that were most definitely NOT the regular style of Tj Kippen. &ldquo;I agree&rdquo; added Andi, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not bad, I think it actually makes you look nicer.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh thanks. It wasn&rsquo;t exactly planned..&rdquo; According to his own opinions, ironically, the glasses made him look stupid. &ldquo;Well what about you Cyrus? What do you think?&rdquo; Tj figured he&rsquo;d ask since they were already discussing it. He also noticed Cyrus hadn&rsquo;t said anything yet which was sort of starting to make Tj worry that he didn&rsquo;t like the &ldquo;I ran out of the house ten minutes late&rdquo; look.</p><p>Instead, Cyrus stood there with a huge dorky grin on his face, admiring Tj and this relaxed style that he seemed to have today. &ldquo;Oh I uh- it&rsquo;s really- you look- I mean- wow&hellip;&rdquo; Normally it would feel awkward but the lack of a sentence seemed to be enough to make the older boy flattered, the red tint spreading along his cheeks at the same time as Cyrus&rsquo;s. &ldquo;I just mean that you look good, -uh it, your hair, it looks good like that. Yup, that&rsquo;s it I&rsquo;ll stop now,&rdquo; Cyrus laughed uneasily. He suddenly made eye contact with Tj and neither of them really stopped it.</p><p>At that point Buffy that felt her and Andi should probably go, so she broke the silence that was starting to set in. &ldquo;Come on we&rsquo;d better get to class before we&rsquo;re late.&rdquo; She grabbed Andi&rsquo;s arm and started moving her away but the girl protested, not understanding what Buffy was trying to do. &ldquo;Wait what we still have 5 minutes?&rdquo; Then, not so subtly giving Andi the<i> come on lets leave them alone look</i>, Buffy said &ldquo;oh yeah what I mean is I have to go get something from my locker and I need Andi to come with me.&rdquo; She was usually better at making up excuses but it didn&rsquo;t matter, Andi got what she was doing and followed along with it. &ldquo;Right! I forgot something in there yesterday and I uh.. need it for class! See you guys in a few!&rdquo;</p><p>After Andi and Buffy walked away Tj realized he still had his arm on Cyrus&rsquo;s shoulder and decided to keep it there anyways because hey, Cyrus didn&rsquo;t say anything yet, and Tj definitely didn&rsquo;t mind. He&rsquo;s had a crush on Cyrus for a few months now, he&rsquo;s just never had the courage to say anything. But something today, out of nowhere, something <i>changed</i> while seeing Cyrus and he couldn&rsquo;t explain it. Even with himself looking like a mess, he knew in that moment that today was when he had to tell him his feelings whether or not Cyrus would feel the same way.</p><p>&ldquo;Sooo underdog, can you meet me after school at the swings?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course! Is there any reason?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No not really I just want to tell you something but I don&rsquo;t think we have the time right now,&rdquo; he mentioned to the younger boy conveniently as the bell went off. &ldquo;See you later?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus smirked, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be there.&rdquo; As Tj hugged the boy, he hoped that he wasn&rsquo;t able to feel how quickly his heart was beating. <i>Buh bum, buh bum, buh bum, buh bum</i>. It was probably petty good though that Cyrus just hoped the exact same thing to himself.</p><p>Throughout the whole rest of the day all Tj did was worry, <i>what if he doesn&rsquo;t like me? I don&rsquo;t even know if he&rsquo;s gay.. he kissed that girl Iris, right? Oh no. He&rsquo;s straight. Ok stop I just have to tell him and get it off my chest or else I literally might die of this crush if I don&rsquo;t. </i>As soon as the bell rang for his last class Tj tried to push these thoughts to the back of his mind and pack up his stuff in a hurry to get to the swings.</p><p>He was pretty fast and got their first, so he decided to pick a swing and wait for Cyrus. <i>It&rsquo;s gonna be fine, </i>he convinced himself<i>. Even if I do look like a total mess today.. I wish I had my hair gel or at least my freaking contacts. Stupid homework. </i>At that last thought he looked up and saw Cyrus making his way over and take the swing right beside his own.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey teej! How was your day?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was pretty good actually, I think I passed my math test and I knew most of the answers! Your tutoring has been helping a lot.&rdquo; He smiled to himself at that. Having Cyrus teach him was probably the only thing that got him through math anymore, which is what he considered the most unbearable subject ever.</p><p>&ldquo;Good! I&rsquo;m really proud of you, you&rsquo;ve been working hard to maintain that grade.&rdquo; Although he was calm on the outside, Tj was screaming on the inside about how much he liked this boy. &ldquo;Oh! So what did you want to talk about?&rdquo; Cyrus asked briskly.</p><p><i>Alright, here it goes. </i>&ldquo;Right. Well you see I guess, no I- I know, I like you Cyrus. I have for a while but I really didn&rsquo;t want to mess up what we have already. If you don&rsquo;t feel the same way I get it, I&rsquo;m kind of used to disappointment anyways. I mean hell, I don&rsquo;t even know if you&rsquo;re gay. I just <i>had</i> to get this off my chest.&rdquo; <i>Uhhhh </i>was all that came out of Cyrus&rsquo;s mouth as he stared at Tj who just confessed his feelings for him. A few more seconds of silence went by and Tj, feeling his heart drop to the bottom of his stomach, started to speak again &ldquo;right. Classic Tj. Anything good in my life I gotta mess it up. I&rsquo;m sorry Cyrus, I didn&rsquo;t want to make you feel uncomfortable around me. I&rsquo;ll go and we can forget this happened.&rdquo; As he got up from the swing Cyrus quickly grabbed his arm and pulled him back, a little closer then he planned.</p><p>&ldquo;No wait Tj- It&rsquo;s just that I&rsquo;m in shock that you actually feel that way about me. I mean of course I like you too, I kinda thought it was pretty obvious, I&rsquo;m not very good at hiding my feelings&rdquo; Cyrus admitted, hoping Tj wasn&rsquo;t still upset.</p><p>&ldquo;You seriously don&rsquo;t understand how relieved I am to hear that. I like you so much and honestly, I thought I&rsquo;d lose you if I admitted how I feel, especially knowing I haven&rsquo;t been the best person to be around in the past.&rdquo; Tj sighed, much more relaxed than before. They were just a few inches apart at this point, but Cyrus only grabbed Tjs hand to hold. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I meeaann.. you&rsquo;re not wrong, you might have had some rough moments in the past but that&rsquo;s just it. The past. You changed so much and that&rsquo;s what I admire about you most, the way you made yourself better and proved to me multiple times that you&rsquo;re a good person&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you for believing in me Cyrus. I was kinda starting to lose hope in myself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey it&rsquo;s just another service I provide.&rdquo; He replied with a small laugh. Tj started to lean in now, leaving barely any space between them.</p><p>&ldquo;Is it alright if I kiss you underdog?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Definitely&rdquo; Cyrus smirked, unable to stop his smile. The kiss made Tjs heart beat even faster than it already was and although it wasn&rsquo;t very long it was the best feeling in the world.</p><p>Looking up a few seconds later with totally pink cheeks, Cyrus stated &ldquo;by the way, I almost died when I saw you with the glasses and messy hair. I mean what I really wanted to say earlier is you look adorable but of course I thought you were Mr straight not-so-scary basketball guy, turns out you&rsquo;re just a real softie.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;First of all, I can&rsquo;t believe you thought I was straight. I&rsquo;ve been dropping hints basically forever. Secondly&hellip; huh, maybe I should change my style. Tj the not-so-scary basketball guy who rocks messy hair and glasses.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh no&rdquo; Cyrus joked. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to take it. You&rsquo;d look too cute for me to handle.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s just fair Cy. I&rsquo;ve had to deal with that every day for the past half year&rdquo; Cyrus blushed even more but Tj still couldn&rsquo;t believe this was happening. It probably had to be the best day of his life in this exact moment. He pulled Cyrus in for a close hug and softly kissed the top of his head, closing his eyes for a second, just taking in everything that happened. <i>Cyrus likes me. I kissed Cyrus. Holy shit I kissed Cyrus!!</i></p><p>It only took them a week to come out officially as boyfriends, and Tj was more than happy to give in to Cyrus&rsquo;s constant demand for forehead kisses. It really was so easy being around him and maybe unlike hair or glasses, dating Cyrus definitely wouldn&rsquo;t be one of his problems.</p>",

All I want is you to be happy, and to see your little smile, that bright up my entire universe.\u201d He kept on confessing, since it felt good, finally letting it all out.
