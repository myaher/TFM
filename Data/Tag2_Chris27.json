She stared up at the house in front of her and sighed to herself. She brought the hand break up and took her foot of the break. Checking one last time that she was out of gear, Alessia finally pushed open her door and stepped out.</p><p><br/></p><p>The Boston sunshine was out early this morning and beaming down on her. She grabbed her suitcase from the trunk and wondered up the driveway. </p><p><br/></p><p>She was going to knock but the house seemed too quiet, almost as if they knew she was coming. Placing her palm on the handle she gave a soft shove and sure enough the door opened. She stepped in to the and left her suitcase in the small closet before pushing open the door to the living room.</p><p><br/></p><p>Scattered around the living room was her mother, father, brother, sister, aunts, uncles, cousins and even grandparents.</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;SURPRISE!!&rdquo; They all jumped up and began to blow various party materials. Her brother Alex yanked a string and balloons and banners fell from the ceiling, hanging on a tilt. &ldquo;HAPPY BIRTHDAY!&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo; Alex cursed, annoyed that all of his work was disheveled and wonky. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Thanks guys.&rdquo; She beamed, a tear rolling down her cheek.</p><p><br/></p><p>She went around saying hello and thank you&rsquo;s to all of her relatives before her mother cornered her. &ldquo;Give a little speech darling.&rdquo; She forced a glass of wine into Alessia&rsquo;s hands and pushed her into the centre of the room, or in this case; in front of the fireplace.</p><p><br/></p><p>She looked around nervously, not feeling the most stable as it was let alone now being forced into a public forum. Everyone began tapping their glasses, drawing further attention to the unnerved girl.</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Uh. Hi. Um. Thanks thank you all for coming.&rdquo; She nodded, deciding that was enough she tried to walk away but her mother made wide eyes at her warning her that if her feet left another tile she would regret it. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;I really appreciate all of your love and support, all thirty years of it haha.&rdquo; She made an awkward joke and the small group (but mostly her father) let out various laughs. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice being home and it was an even nicer surprise to see you all gathered here for little old me. Old. I guess I&rsquo;m finally qualified to use that word, sorry Nana Silv I&rsquo;ve coined it now.&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;You think 30&rsquo;s old wait until you get to 70.&rdquo; Nana Silv retorted, the cause of more laugher.</p><p><br/></p><p>Alessia smirked and shook her head. &ldquo;Anyway, the point of me coming here wasn&rsquo;t for my birthday. In fact until I walked through that door I had completely forgotten about the occasion.&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Lucky you! My bits are still burning.&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Mom!&rdquo; Feeling mortified her cheeks flushed a bright red. &ldquo;Ok, that&rsquo;s enough for now. Thank you all again and enjoy the rest of the party.&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>She practically ran from the fireplace, taking her mother with her. When secluded in the kitchen she shrieked. &ldquo;Mom.&rdquo; She complained once again.</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry darling but the idea of embarrassing you presented itself and I&rsquo;d be kicking myself if I didn&rsquo;t take it.&rdquo; Her mother knocked back another glass of wine as her nephew, Joe, ran into the kitchen. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Auntie Alessia! You&rsquo;re on TV!&rdquo; He yelled before running back to the living room. Alessia shared a confused look with her mother before the pair of them bolted.</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;-The pair were spotted leaving a bar on the Friday night, drunkenly holding hands and sharing kisses under street lights.&rdquo; The brunette on tv disappeared and pictures of the pair popped up on screen.</p><p><br/></p><p>Alessia&rsquo;s face turned a ghostly shade of white as her face appeared on screen.</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Following their drunken antics, the following morning the woman, now named as New York based author, Alessia Perri, were spotted leaving the Marvel star&rsquo;s apartment the following morning. The pair were chased down the road by paparazzi all hoping to get a glimpse at the couple. So what do you think? Is this a simple one night stand or could they be America&rsquo;s new sweethearts?

With or without a man. So she recruits one of the Avengers for assistance. But how exactly will that pan out for them? (Part 2 of my series - Chasing Time)</p><p>The more time you and Steve spent alone together the closer the two of you got. However, it made it difficult for you both to keep the same \u2018<i>no strings attached</i>\u2019 charade up. Sure, it was easy at first when you were barely on speaking terms, but that was becoming exceedingly difficult since you were now sleeping together. Every time it happened you found yourself wanting to stay a little longer, and snuggle a little closer to him, and a part of you thought that Steve wouldn\u2019t mind if you had. To be honest, it almost felt like he was upset to see you go.</p><p>After a little more than a month he told you about a mission he\u2019d be going on with the rest of the crew, and a pit formed in your stomach. You were terrified that something might happen to him, but you refused to let your emotions get in the way. With a heavy heart, you watched him take off in the quinjet, not knowing how long it would be until he came back; or if he would make it back at all.</p><p>With your nerves on end you race to the bathroom, spilling your lunch in the sink until there was nothing left to throw up. You wipe your mouth before opening the cabinet to retrieve your toothbrush and toothpaste. Surely you couldn\u2019t be pregnant already; you hadn\u2019t felt any different than usual. When you finish brushing your teeth you open the cabinet to put it all away and spot the pregnancy test sitting on the top shelf. \u2018<i>It wouldn\u2019t hurt to try</i>?\u2019 You thought to yourself, pulling it out and tearing open the box. Two of them fell out into the sink, and you picked them up, shaking.</p><p>\u201c<i>Please, please, please</i>,\u201d you stammered, peeing on the sticks and setting a timer. If this came back positive, you\u2019d never have to sleep with Steve again. You still hadn\u2019t decided if that was a blessing or a curse. The feelings could end here like you hoped, or you\u2019d end up wishing this had never happened.</p><p>You hesitated as the sound of the timer rang through the tiny bathroom and leapt from the floor in shock. There it was; two pink lines displayed on both of the tests. The first thing that popped into your head was whether or not you should tell Steve. Doing it over the phone was the last thing you wanted, but in the odd chance that he wouldn\u2019t make it, you felt he should know.</p><p>As you dialed his number, your finger paused above the button, ready to end the call, but it was too late; he answered. \u201cY/n, is everything okay? We\u2019ve barely been gone an hour,\u201d there was no doubting the way his voice broke in the middle of his sentence. Apparently, he was just as worried about you as you were about him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, I was just checking to make sure you were all okay?\u201d You lied, <i>why did you lie</i>? That knot in your stomach tightened, and you felt the urge to just get it over with but couldn\u2019t bring yourself to do it.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re fine,\u201d Steve affirmed, softly, looking around at everyone. They were all questioning why she had called as well. With their eyes continuing to pierce through him he decided to find the nearest room and shut the door for a little more privacy. \u201cY/n, are you sure that\u2019s why you\u2019re calling? It doesn\u2019t have anything to do with something else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Steve, I promise, everything\u2019s alright. Just enjoy your time away and try to relax a little. I\u2019m sure the team would love to see you sipping dry martinis on the beach,\u201d you giggled, trying to play it off as nothing.</p><p>\u201cSure, and then I\u2019ll let Banner be Captain,\u201d he retaliated, making you smile a genuine smile.</p><p>\u201cJust promise me you\u2019ll make it back in one piece,\u201d you heard yourself saying before you could stop the words from escaping past your lips. He went radio silent for a moment, and it sounded as though he was trying to think of what to say as he let out a heavy sigh.</p><p>\u201cOkay, but if I don\u2019t, then don\u2019t let Stark anywhere near you. He\u2019s got a big enough head for two people the way it is; I\u2019d hate to see how much worse his kids would be.\u201d Steve quipped, continuing to give out demands.</p><p>\u201cThe day I sleep with Tony Stark is the day Loki rules Asgard,\u201d you shot back, knowing that was one command you would gladly abide by.</p><p>\u201cThen I have nothing to worry about,\u201d he smirked before the smile slowly fell from his face. \u201cI\u2019ll see you soon, y/n.\u201d There was a promise in his voice that made your heart beat a little faster at the sound.</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d you breathed as your eyes began to fill with tears. You both ended the call, and your hand slowly fell to your stomach as it rested against your flat tummy. \u201cWell, baby, looks like it\u2019s just you and me,\u201d you whispered to the child that was growing inside of you even though you doubted they could hear what you were saying.</p><p>When the time came for everyone to return you waited eagerly for the quinjet. In the weeks that Steve had been away your feelings for him hadn\u2019t diminished but almost tripled. You found yourself missing that one on one time with him and feeling his warmth against you. When he was gone it was like everything you\u2019d ever wanted had just been ripped away and being stuck in Stark Tower by yourself for so long made life a little dull.</p><p>What you hadn\u2019t expected was for Steve to come bounding over to you as he grabbed you by the wrist and dragged you inside. Once you were alone in his room, he looked you deep in the eyes with a concern that made you want to kiss all his worries away.</p><p>\u201cY/n,\u201d he choked out finally, pulling you into his warm embrace. Why was he doing this? Did he already know?</p><p>\u201cSteve, it\u2019s okay, I\u2019m here. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d You blinked, trying to distinguish the look on his face. Was he crying?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to tell you this, but something happened on the mission.\u201d There was a sense of urgency in his voice. A panicking tone that made your skin crawl at the sound. \u201cHalf the people in the world are gone,\u201d his lashes fluttered as he fought back tears.</p><p>\u201cWh-what are you talking about?\u201d Your face went blank, hoping beyond hope that this was all just some kind of crazy dream that you\u2019d wake up from in a minute.</p><p>\u201cVision?\u201d You stammered, and Steve shook his head. \u201cPeter?\u201d Again, he was silent. \u201cOh, Steve, no, don\u2019t tell me\u2026Bucky?\u201d That was it; that was his undoing. In that moment he crumbled in your arms as the tears began to overflow. He\u2019d just lost his best friend, and you were the only one he wanted there to comfort him.</p><p>Holding him in your arms you helped him to the bed where the two of you sat down, never letting go of each other. Somehow, you still didn\u2019t know how it happened, you had ended up curled together at the top of the bed. Steve was cuddling you so fiercely that there wasn\u2019t a doubt in your mind that he was afraid you were going to disappear too.</p><p>When he finally spoke, you could feel your heart racing against him. The way his voice shook made you terrified of what this world was going to be like now. It was like the sound of a broken man who had given everything to win, but still managed to lose. Never in your many years of knowing Steve Rogers did you ever feel like he was weak, but this wasn\u2019t your Steve anymore. It seemed as though he had lost his will to live, to fight, and to breathe.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you call me that first day?\u201d Steve asked as sadness continued to cloud his features.</p><p>\u201cSteve, not now, it\u2019s not the time,\u201d you whispered, running your thumb against the tears on his cheeks to wipe them all away. Your heart ached as you took in the sight of the man before you, and you thought to yourself that what you had to say could wait a little while longer.</p><p>\u201cTell me you\u2019re pregnant,\u201d he begged, resting his large hand against your slightly bigger tummy. The t-shirt you\u2019d been wearing had covered the tiny bump that was already starting to form, and you hoped that this may be what he needed to keep going.</p><p>There were no words to say as your whole face lit up, and you looked up to let your eyes meet his. For the first time since he\u2019d gotten off the quinjet there was a smile spread across his face, and you were happy that he finally knew.</p><p>It took a while for the two of you to finally drag yourselves out of bed. Soon enough the hunger became too demanding, and your need for human interaction was a must. You needed someone else to shine a little light in your lives, and you were hoping that everyone wasn\u2019t too depressed to do so. Together you all gathered in the living room, sitting down and looking around solemnly. Natasha was sitting in on the couch with had her legs propped up on the coffee table, and Thor was sprawled out in the recliner. Clint was sitting opposite from Nat, but he looked like he didn\u2019t want to be there; just like everyone else.</p><p>\u201cGuys, I know this is probably a bad time, but I need to tell you something,\u201d you proceeded, trying not to meet their eyes. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant,\u201d you breathed, finally taking in the expressions on their faces. No one seemed mad, or upset, or angry. Instead they put on a fake smile and pretended to be happy with the good news.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the father?\u201d Nat asked, looking around the room at the guys. I noticed her eyes lingered on Steve a half a second longer then the other two but made nothing of it.</p><p>\u201cActually, I had a donor,\u201d you explain, filling them in on the entire process. Saying that it took a little bit of time before one finally took, but that you were excited none the less.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d they all said, hugging you tightly, and rubbing your little belly. If your calculations were correct you were just at two months pregnant which meant there were only seven months left. You were more than ready for that seven months to come flying by, though, especially with how different things were going to be around here. You could use a little bundle of joy to brighten your days. What you still had to figure out, though, was what you were going to do about your feelings for Steve.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>@carebaredanvers <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLol1OcHL2rmi9B4PNj0NWQ\">@torntaltos</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnFX0pXMCKg_8GMvIKMEqoQ\">@homecomlng</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCKGyB8y0bJM6lTdhbDcNdg\">@bluediamondsevie</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCbV1cF2DMP4gAqwGA6V2YA\">@vesta-ro</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUfRsJskiU5727kZKnV69JQ\">@iron-sass</a> </p>",

With or without a man. So she recruits one of the Avengers for assistance. But how exactly will that pan out for them? (Part 2 of my series - Chasing Time)</p><p>The more time you and Steve spent alone together the closer the two of you got. However, it made it difficult for you both to keep the same \u2018<i>no strings attached</i>\u2019 charade up. Sure, it was easy at first when you were barely on speaking terms, but that was becoming exceedingly difficult since you were now sleeping together. Every time it happened you found yourself wanting to stay a little longer, and snuggle a little closer to him, and a part of you thought that Steve wouldn\u2019t mind if you had. To be honest, it almost felt like he was upset to see you go.</p><p>After a little more than a month he told you about a mission he\u2019d be going on with the rest of the crew, and a pit formed in your stomach. You were terrified that something might happen to him, but you refused to let your emotions get in the way. With a heavy heart, you watched him take off in the quinjet, not knowing how long it would be until he came back; or if he would make it back at all.</p><p>With your nerves on end you race to the bathroom, spilling your lunch in the sink until there was nothing left to throw up. You wipe your mouth before opening the cabinet to retrieve your toothbrush and toothpaste. Surely you couldn\u2019t be pregnant already; you hadn\u2019t felt any different than usual. When you finish brushing your teeth you open the cabinet to put it all away and spot the pregnancy test sitting on the top shelf. \u2018<i>It wouldn\u2019t hurt to try</i>?\u2019 You thought to yourself, pulling it out and tearing open the box. Two of them fell out into the sink, and you picked them up, shaking.</p><p>\u201c<i>Please, please, please</i>,\u201d you stammered, peeing on the sticks and setting a timer. If this came back positive, you\u2019d never have to sleep with Steve again. You still hadn\u2019t decided if that was a blessing or a curse. The feelings could end here like you hoped, or you\u2019d end up wishing this had never happened.</p><p>You hesitated as the sound of the timer rang through the tiny bathroom and leapt from the floor in shock. There it was; two pink lines displayed on both of the tests. The first thing that popped into your head was whether or not you should tell Steve. Doing it over the phone was the last thing you wanted, but in the odd chance that he wouldn\u2019t make it, you felt he should know.</p><p>As you dialed his number, your finger paused above the button, ready to end the call, but it was too late; he answered. \u201cY/n, is everything okay? We\u2019ve barely been gone an hour,\u201d there was no doubting the way his voice broke in the middle of his sentence. Apparently, he was just as worried about you as you were about him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, I was just checking to make sure you were all okay?\u201d You lied, <i>why did you lie</i>? That knot in your stomach tightened, and you felt the urge to just get it over with but couldn\u2019t bring yourself to do it.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re fine,\u201d Steve affirmed, softly, looking around at everyone. They were all questioning why she had called as well. With their eyes continuing to pierce through him he decided to find the nearest room and shut the door for a little more privacy. \u201cY/n, are you sure that\u2019s why you\u2019re calling? It doesn\u2019t have anything to do with something else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Steve, I promise, everything\u2019s alright. Just enjoy your time away and try to relax a little. I\u2019m sure the team would love to see you sipping dry martinis on the beach,\u201d you giggled, trying to play it off as nothing.</p><p>\u201cSure, and then I\u2019ll let Banner be Captain,\u201d he retaliated, making you smile a genuine smile.</p><p>\u201cJust promise me you\u2019ll make it back in one piece,\u201d you heard yourself saying before you could stop the words from escaping past your lips. He went radio silent for a moment, and it sounded as though he was trying to think of what to say as he let out a heavy sigh.</p><p>\u201cOkay, but if I don\u2019t, then don\u2019t let Stark anywhere near you. He\u2019s got a big enough head for two people the way it is; I\u2019d hate to see how much worse his kids would be.\u201d Steve quipped, continuing to give out demands.</p><p>\u201cThe day I sleep with Tony Stark is the day Loki rules Asgard,\u201d you shot back, knowing that was one command you would gladly abide by.</p><p>\u201cThen I have nothing to worry about,\u201d he smirked before the smile slowly fell from his face. \u201cI\u2019ll see you soon, y/n.\u201d There was a promise in his voice that made your heart beat a little faster at the sound.</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d you breathed as your eyes began to fill with tears. You both ended the call, and your hand slowly fell to your stomach as it rested against your flat tummy. \u201cWell, baby, looks like it\u2019s just you and me,\u201d you whispered to the child that was growing inside of you even though you doubted they could hear what you were saying.</p><p>When the time came for everyone to return you waited eagerly for the quinjet. In the weeks that Steve had been away your feelings for him hadn\u2019t diminished but almost tripled. You found yourself missing that one on one time with him and feeling his warmth against you. When he was gone it was like everything you\u2019d ever wanted had just been ripped away and being stuck in Stark Tower by yourself for so long made life a little dull.</p><p>What you hadn\u2019t expected was for Steve to come bounding over to you as he grabbed you by the wrist and dragged you inside. Once you were alone in his room, he looked you deep in the eyes with a concern that made you want to kiss all his worries away.</p><p>\u201cY/n,\u201d he choked out finally, pulling you into his warm embrace. Why was he doing this? Did he already know?</p><p>\u201cSteve, it\u2019s okay, I\u2019m here. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d You blinked, trying to distinguish the look on his face. Was he crying?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to tell you this, but something happened on the mission.\u201d There was a sense of urgency in his voice. A panicking tone that made your skin crawl at the sound. \u201cHalf the people in the world are gone,\u201d his lashes fluttered as he fought back tears.</p><p>\u201cWh-what are you talking about?\u201d Your face went blank, hoping beyond hope that this was all just some kind of crazy dream that you\u2019d wake up from in a minute.</p><p>\u201cVision?\u201d You stammered, and Steve shook his head. \u201cPeter?\u201d Again, he was silent. \u201cOh, Steve, no, don\u2019t tell me\u2026Bucky?\u201d That was it; that was his undoing. In that moment he crumbled in your arms as the tears began to overflow. He\u2019d just lost his best friend, and you were the only one he wanted there to comfort him.</p><p>Holding him in your arms you helped him to the bed where the two of you sat down, never letting go of each other. Somehow, you still didn\u2019t know how it happened, you had ended up curled together at the top of the bed. Steve was cuddling you so fiercely that there wasn\u2019t a doubt in your mind that he was afraid you were going to disappear too.</p><p>When he finally spoke, you could feel your heart racing against him. The way his voice shook made you terrified of what this world was going to be like now. It was like the sound of a broken man who had given everything to win, but still managed to lose. Never in your many years of knowing Steve Rogers did you ever feel like he was weak, but this wasn\u2019t your Steve anymore. It seemed as though he had lost his will to live, to fight, and to breathe.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you call me that first day?\u201d Steve asked as sadness continued to cloud his features.</p><p>\u201cSteve, not now, it\u2019s not the time,\u201d you whispered, running your thumb against the tears on his cheeks to wipe them all away. Your heart ached as you took in the sight of the man before you, and you thought to yourself that what you had to say could wait a little while longer.</p><p>\u201cTell me you\u2019re pregnant,\u201d he begged, resting his large hand against your slightly bigger tummy. The t-shirt you\u2019d been wearing had covered the tiny bump that was already starting to form, and you hoped that this may be what he needed to keep going.</p><p>There were no words to say as your whole face lit up, and you looked up to let your eyes meet his. For the first time since he\u2019d gotten off the quinjet there was a smile spread across his face, and you were happy that he finally knew.</p><p>It took a while for the two of you to finally drag yourselves out of bed. Soon enough the hunger became too demanding, and your need for human interaction was a must. You needed someone else to shine a little light in your lives, and you were hoping that everyone wasn\u2019t too depressed to do so. Together you all gathered in the living room, sitting down and looking around solemnly. Natasha was sitting in on the couch with had her legs propped up on the coffee table, and Thor was sprawled out in the recliner. Clint was sitting opposite from Nat, but he looked like he didn\u2019t want to be there; just like everyone else.</p><p>\u201cGuys, I know this is probably a bad time, but I need to tell you something,\u201d you proceeded, trying not to meet their eyes. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant,\u201d you breathed, finally taking in the expressions on their faces. No one seemed mad, or upset, or angry. Instead they put on a fake smile and pretended to be happy with the good news.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the father?\u201d Nat asked, looking around the room at the guys. I noticed her eyes lingered on Steve a half a second longer then the other two but made nothing of it.</p><p>\u201cActually, I had a donor,\u201d you explain, filling them in on the entire process. Saying that it took a little bit of time before one finally took, but that you were excited none the less.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d they all said, hugging you tightly, and rubbing your little belly. If your calculations were correct you were just at two months pregnant which meant there were only seven months left. You were more than ready for that seven months to come flying by, though, especially with how different things were going to be around here. You could use a little bundle of joy to brighten your days. What you still had to figure out, though, was what you were going to do about your feelings for Steve.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>@carebaredanvers <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLol1OcHL2rmi9B4PNj0NWQ\">@torntaltos</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnFX0pXMCKg_8GMvIKMEqoQ\">@homecomlng</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCKGyB8y0bJM6lTdhbDcNdg\">@bluediamondsevie</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCbV1cF2DMP4gAqwGA6V2YA\">@vesta-ro</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUfRsJskiU5727kZKnV69JQ\">@iron-sass</a> </p></p>",
